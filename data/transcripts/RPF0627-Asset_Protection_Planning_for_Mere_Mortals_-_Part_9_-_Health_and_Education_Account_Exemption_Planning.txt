[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.260]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.300]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.900]   Today, we continue with our Asset Protection Planning for Mere Mortals series.
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.980]   This is part 9 of that series, wherein we discuss health and education account exemption planning.
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.780]   A few moments of preamble here.
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.960]   When I began this series, I wanted to really focus it in on useful advice for Mere Mortals.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.760]   And when I use that term, I'm simply meaning relatively ordinary people.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.500]   Ordinary people who are earning wages or have profits from an ordinary business.
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.240]   And those wages, I'm assuming, are in the thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.700]   Not particularly in the millions of dollars of annual earnings.
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.620]   And normal amounts of wealth for somebody who is proficient at accumulating capital. Hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.220]   That's where this series is really focused.
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.580]   I'm specifically ignoring the very high-income earners.
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.620]   Not because these techniques cannot be used by a high-income earner.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.700]   If you're making $30 million per year, you can still use these techniques.
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.900]   It's just that these techniques don't accomplish what you need to accomplish.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.700]   They're just not big enough to really make a big difference in your personal scenario.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.380]   Because the limits are, by comparison to how much money you have to protect, they're not useful.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.780]   They're just not big enough.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.280]   For example, today we're talking about health and education accounts.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.220]   And I'm going to talk to you about health savings accounts in a moment.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.660]   Where you can put $7,000 a year into that.
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.700]   Well, $7,000 a year for somebody who's making $100,000 a year can be a very meaningful contribution.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.700]   That's 7%.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.700]   $7,000 a year for somebody who's making $20 million a year is not at all meaningful.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.140]   It's not that they can't still make that contribution.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.420]   It's just that it simply is irrelevant to the most important planning techniques that are available.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.620]   So that's what I mean by mere mortals.
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.420]   When I began this series, I talked about asset protection extremely broadly.
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.920]   I encouraged you to think about protecting the things that are most important to you.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.220]   In a very broad sense.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.420]   But of course, when we use this term, asset protection planning, we're usually thinking about your financial assets.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.720]   How to protect your money and your financial assets from the risk of creditors.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   That's the common accepted use of this term.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   And so then in part two, I zoomed in on that.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.720]   We talked about the legality and morality of asset protection planning.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.720]   And then I started talking about exemption planning.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   Because exemption planning, which is the practice of owning assets that have some kind of built-in statutory protection.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   From lawsuits or from creditors or from bankruptcy court.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.720]   Exemption planning is the simplest way to get into asset protection planning.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   In exemption planning, we've talked about using the homestead exemption to protect your house.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   We've talked about the pension and retirement account exemptions to protect your IRAs, your 401(k)s.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   We've talked about exemption planning for life insurance policies.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   Both the death benefits of those policies and also inside buildup of cash values.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.720]   If you have a cash value type policy.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   We've talked about annuities extensively.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.720]   And today we're going to continue with the discussion of health and education accounts.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   And then I plan in my series, I plan to also next cover in this series the personal property exemptions.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.720]   As well as an additional episode on wage exemption planning.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.720]   And that should wrap up the exemption planning.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   Because these are things that anybody can do without an attorney.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   Just any normal person.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.720]   These accounts that are exempt, these assets that are statutorily exempt from the claims of creditors.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   Are things that are available to you just by knowing how useful they are.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.720]   There are many other assets that, sorry, strategies that can be discussed.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   We can talk about titling your assets into protective entities of various kinds.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   We can talk about equity stripping assets and protecting them in many ways.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.720]   And unbundling the rights of ownership of property.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   So that you can enjoy the use of property without actually having the ownership of the property, etc.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720]   I'm not sure how far I'm going to take this series.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   But this exemption planning is the meat and potato stuff that is really useful for mere mortals.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   Now I need to give you one important caveat and listen carefully to me.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   In this show I'm going to speak very broadly.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   And I'm going to smooth over a lot of important details.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.720]   There are a lot of rules in exemption planning.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   And the rules are different depending on whether we're talking about creditor protection.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.720]   In the case of a lawsuit or someone becoming a judgment creditor by winning a lawsuit.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.720]   And that's different than bankruptcy court, protecting our assets through bankruptcy court.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.720]   There are many, many rules, especially those that relate to bankruptcy.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.720]   And those rules are very technical.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   For example, who is the beneficiary of the 529 plan when you were putting money into it?
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   When was the contribution made?
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   365 days before the bankruptcy court, 720 days, etc.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   You need to research these rules for your particular state.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   Because some of them are federal, some of them are statewide.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   I'm just going to speak very broadly so that you can have enough of an idea that this is useful stuff.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   And you should go and research your state.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   But if you don't do something right in the details, don't blame me.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.720]   First of all, I'm just some random guy giving advice to you on the internet.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   But I guess probably I shouldn't say that advice, right, if we get into all the semantics.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.720]   I'm a random guy spouting out entertaining stuff on the internet that will hopefully help you to do your own research.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   That's how you should approach this.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   Now, let's talk first about health accounts, and then we'll move to education accounts.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.720]   There are three basic types of health accounts that I want to talk about.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   First, health savings accounts, and by extension, medical savings accounts.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   Of course, MSAs are not used anymore.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.720]   Very few people have them, so these rules apply to MSAs.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   But I'm just going to ignore that because they're just really not relevant in today's world.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   At least I don't see anybody really maintaining these accounts, even though they technically can.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   So HSAs, health savings accounts, FSAs, flexible spending accounts, and I'll briefly touch on HRAs, health reimbursement arrangements.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   But let's start with HSAs.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   HSAs are one of the more useful accounts that you can use.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   And they're not a type of account that many people think much about when it comes to credit protection or asset protection.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   By way of review, an HSA is an account into which you can contribute money if you have an associated high deductible health plan.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   And your contributions to those accounts can be tax advantaged.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   The HSA allows you to contribute money to the account pre-tax, which is useful.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   The money grows with no taxes on earnings.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   The money can be spent out of the account for qualified medical expenses, and it can be spent without taxes, which means that that money is completely income tax free.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:22.720]   And at retirement age, once you're past 65, if you are no longer -- if you don't need the money for medical expenses, you can take it out.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.720]   And at which time you would pay income taxes on the money, but you would not pay any penalty taxes.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   So in that way, it functions something like an IRA in that case.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.720]   HSAs have reasonable contribution limits.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.720]   You can contribute as an individual in 2019 $3,500 to the account.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   For a couple married filing jointly, it's $7,000 to the account.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   So that can be useful to many people.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   And they have a number of other advantages.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.720]   For example, an HSA doesn't have the disadvantage of having to have required minimum distributions.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   So you can accumulate the money in the account for a very long period of time, unlike an IRA, which has required minimum distributions.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:06.720]   Other advantages of an HSA involve their exemptions from payroll taxes, from your employment taxes.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:15.720]   If you contribute to an HSA through an employer deduction, the money that goes into it is completely exempt from your employment taxes.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   And that saves you an effective 7.65% of taxes on wages that are usually assessed to you by your employers.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   This can be very useful to also not only avoid the income tax, but also to avoid your employment taxes if you have an HSA with your employer.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   And I think these accounts are particularly interesting when you apply some of the more extreme uses.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:46.720]   For example, I think my friend Brandon over at the Mad Scientist has done really a yeoman's work on enhancing these accounts
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   and using them in ways that the legislators never intended to help people who are involved in early retirement.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   The basic strategy there is that you accumulate money in the health savings account, and you save and document all of your medical expenses,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   but you don't immediately take the money out of the account when you incur the medical expenses.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   Rather, you use other sources of income, other savings, to pay for those medical expenses.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   So you simply accumulate all of your medical expenses over time, and then at some point in the future when you're ready,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   you can just simply take your distributions and at that point in time use your expenditures, use your receipts,
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   to make sure that that money is received to you completely income tax-free, even though it's before 65,
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   and even though you're taking it perhaps 30 years after the original medical expense was made.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   I think it's a great strategy, and it's a good way of exploiting the rules.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   Now, are HSA accounts protected from creditors?
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.720]   And here, the answer, as I tried to show you, is it varies depending on whether you're talking about bankruptcy or creditor protection.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.720]   Now let's talk about protection from creditors.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   There is a federal law that protects a health savings account if that health savings account is set up with your employer.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:08.720]   So this is another benefit to establishing an HSA directly through your employer rather than as an individual.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:15.720]   The first benefit, of course, being that your HSA contributions, if done through your employer, can be exempt from payroll taxes.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   So there is a federal law that protects these accounts if it's set up by an employer.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   Now, if it's not set up by an employer, then it will depend on your specific state.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.720]   And in some states, yes. I have not researched all the states. You can do that.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   But I would bet that if I did go through and do the exhaustive research on every state,
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   it would basically follow the general tone of your state's laws.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:45.720]   If you live in a state that is very focused on exempting certain kinds of accounts from the claims of creditors with significant generosity,
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.720]   such as my state, Florida, then your state probably would protect HSAs.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   My state, Florida, completely protects HSAs from the claims of creditors in the HSA funds.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   If you are in a state that does not work with that general theory that applies to creditor protection, my guess is it's probably no.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.720]   In which case, you should make other plans or consider moving.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   So that's for creditor protection.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   Generally, probably so, if it's set up with an employer, it falls under the coverage of a federal law.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   And if it's not set up with your employer, or you just have taken it independent of your job, research your particular state.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   Now, in bankruptcy, the situation is a little bit more clouded on HSAs.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   And also, the reason that I talk both about creditor protection and bankruptcy is first because the laws are complementary,
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   but also because although most of us are thinking first about creditor protection,
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   we have to acknowledge that any one of us could wind up in bankruptcy.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   Even if you never borrowed money, the most extreme form of a creditor who wins a lawsuit against you becomes a judgment creditor.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   The most extreme form of their ability to collect on that debt is to force you into involuntary bankruptcy.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   If they can possibly do that by working through the machinations of the legal system to force you into involuntary bankruptcy,
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   then they can force your bankruptcy estate to disgorge assets, and they can file their claim on that bankruptcy estate and collect the money.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:21.720]   So, we always need to think about bankruptcy in addition to just simply thinking about, "Hey, they're coming after us with a lawsuit."
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.720]   So, in bankruptcy, the situation is a little bit clouded.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   There is an interesting legal argument between whether an HSA is a trust account versus an insurance plan,
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   and this has to do whether the particular assets are going to be part of your bankruptcy estate or not.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.720]   And that's where it's going to matter.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:51.720]   Now, the federal bankruptcy exemptions do not protect HSA funds in bankruptcy.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   So, that's important.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   The federal bankruptcy exemptions, if your state uses those, do not protect HSA funds in bankruptcy.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   But your state might provide a specific exemption.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   I know that the states of Florida, Mississippi, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia do.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   I found that in one article in researching the subject.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   It might be that other states do as well.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   So, you will have to research that carefully for yourself to understand whether or not your HSA would be protected in bankruptcy.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   But the net summary, again, this is why I began with the preamble that I'm speaking very broadly,
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   the net summary is that HSAs and money that is accumulated inside of a health savings account is indeed protected in many or most situations from the claims of creditors.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   That can make this particular account very useful because if you have an account that you can contribute $7,000 into per year,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   and if you can leave that money alone and have it just simply accumulate over many decades,
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.720]   this can be very significant.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.720]   And with the flexibility of the account, this legislation that protects the HSA can be quite useful.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   Let's move on to the flexible spending account.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   Flexible spending account, of course, is one that many more people are involved with and understand.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.720]   Basically, a flexible spending account allows you to make a contribution to the account each year.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.720]   Sometimes your employer makes a contribution, sometimes you do it, and then you have to use the funds in it for medical expenses.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   After the passage of the 2013 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, there were a couple of changes made to FSAs.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   And FSAs, those changes were that there was a low contribution limit established.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   Currently, I think it's $2,700 per year.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.720]   And you have the requirement that those FSA funds have to be used and spent by the end of the year.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   And so most people don't put very much into this because you can't.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   And since you can't accumulate it, the account is generally not going to be all that much money.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   You just can't.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.720]   If you're starting over from zero every day, the most we're talking about here is $2,700,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   which to mere mortals really is not going to be that significant.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:03.720]   Now, of course, FSAs generally are protected, but that's basically because they're just simply scheduled to expire.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   If you are in a situation where you think there's going to be a contentious situation,
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   I would max out my FSA and try to make maximum use of it.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.720]   So know that it is protected, but it's not going to make much of a difference to you.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.720]   The final medical account to briefly touch on is the health reimbursement arrangement.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   So, of course, your health reimbursement arrangement is a self-insured medical reimbursement plan established with your company
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.720]   where your company agrees to reimburse you for your medical expenses.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   This is one of the more useful tax reduction techniques for people who own the proper company
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   or who can establish a proper company because you can set it up so that your company pays for virtually all
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   or many of your medical expenses, and it becomes a completely pre-taxed, tax-free arrangement
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.720]   where the company is just simply reimbursing you for all of your qualified medical expenses.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.720]   It's one of the best ways if you have a situation, for example, you have four children
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   and all of them are going to need orthodontia and you're trying to figure out how on earth do I pay for this?
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.720]   Well, the answer is health reimbursement arrangement.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   If you do that and you set it up properly, you can set it up so that your company will pay for the orthodontia
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   and you can pay for those expensive corrective devices with pre-tax dollars,
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   and you can use this for many other things as well.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   So health reimbursement arrangement I think is very, very useful and you should consider it.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   Now I think, although I haven't been able to find good information from the attorneys writing on this,
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.720]   I think this also can be a useful way of protecting some money within your company,
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   but you're primarily protected simply because those funds are segregated into a separate business entity,
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   and so this is not a strict exemption planning technique.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.720]   Rather, it's more of an entity titling technique where you are paying for your medical expenses
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.720]   and then being reimbursed for them by your company,
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.720]   and the funds are protected because they are held by the company,
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.720]   and your company has a documented health reimbursement arrangement with you.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   So I think that is also useful if you're making use of a health reimbursement arrangement,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   then that can be a useful way of protecting some assets.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.720]   So in summary, health accounts can be useful.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.720]   The most important one being an HSA, and if you can qualify for one,
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   factor it into your asset protection planning.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.720]   Let's move on to education accounts.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.720]   Education accounts, there are of course many,
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.720]   but I just briefly want to talk about 529 accounts,
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   technically known as qualified tuition programs, Coverdell educational savings accounts,
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   and then briefly on UTMA and UGMA accounts.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.720]   There are other types of accounts that can be established.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   You could do tax-free savings bonds, etc., but those are very unpopular.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   I don't see anybody doing that.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.720]   So let's just talk about these big three, beginning again with the most important one
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.720]   being qualified tuition programs or 529 accounts.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   529 funds can be very, very useful, and they can be protected
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   both from the claims of creditors and from the claims of a bankruptcy court.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   Now, why can 529s be so useful?
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.720]   First, there's no specified limit on the contributions today.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.720]   There's no limit.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   Rather, the IRS says the contributions to a 529 account cannot exceed the amount necessary
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.720]   to provide for the qualified education expenses of the beneficiary.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.720]   It is not a strict dollar amount contribution.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.720]   This means that you can contribute a lot of money to the 529 accounts.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.720]   And with the recent change in the tax code with the--what are people calling them?
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   At the end of 2017, the Trump tax cuts, I guess.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.720]   I don't remember the specific term for that, the label for that.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   I think it was the tax art, the TCGA, Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   One of the major changes in that with 529 accounts is that now you can use a 529 account
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:54.720]   not only for qualified upper-level college expenses,
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.720]   but now you can use a 529 account for your private school expenses from K through 12,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   up to $10,000 per year of private school expenses for K through 12.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.720]   Previously, that was a major benefit of the Coverdell Educational Savings Account.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.720]   Now it's also a major benefit for the 529 account.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.720]   Well, you do the math.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.720]   If you imagine that you can establish an account with $10,000 per year with over 12 years,
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   that's $120,000 of undergraduate expenses--of primary and secondary school expenses right there.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   And then additionally, you have now college, potentially undergraduate and graduate-level work
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   that can be accumulated in a 529 account.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   You could very conceivably accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars in a 529 account
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   without worrying about ever maxing out whatever that means when the IRS says
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.720]   that your contributions to the account cannot exceed the amount necessary to provide
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   for the qualified education expenses of the beneficiary.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.720]   Now in addition, the other limitation on a 529 account is the idea that
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   your contributions to that account represent a completed gift.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   Now in estate planning, this is very useful because in order for you to make a transfer
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.720]   out of your estate, you have to make a completed gift.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   And a completed gift generally means that you surrender control over the asset.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   If I make a completed gift to you, I have to give you property,
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   and I can't have or exercise any control over that account.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   529 accounts are an interesting scenario because since the IRS ruled that a contribution
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.720]   to a 529 account is a completed gift, it qualifies for helping people to transfer money
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   out of their personal taxable estate for estate tax purposes,
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   but they can still control the beneficiary on the account.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   So I could make a gift to a 529 account that I own, and I can make my grandson
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   the beneficiary of that account, but then two years later I can decide to make--
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.720]   or I can make my son the beneficiary, but then two years later I can make my grandson
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   the beneficiary on the account.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.720]   And so 529 accounts have a very useful role in estate planning.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   But the limitation on 529 accounts is because it's a gift, and a completed gift,
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   you're subject to the gift tax rules.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.720]   But 529 accounts qualify for a special election that you can make
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.720]   wherein you can contribute five years' worth of your annual exclusion amount
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.720]   into the account.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.720]   And so of course in 2019, the annual exclusion amount, which any person can give
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   to any other person without filing a gift tax return, without any taxes whatsoever,
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   is $15,000, which means that any individual can contribute up to five years of that,
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:37.720]   $75,000, into a 529 account for a specific beneficiary.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   And of course that limit is per beneficiary.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.720]   And then of course you can split the gifts for father and mother, or grandparents
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.720]   if they choose to split their gifts.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:53.720]   So any person can contribute up to $150,000 today into a 529 account
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   for one individual beneficiary.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.720]   And so if you have multiple children or if you have multiple grandchildren,
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   you can do $150,000 per for yourself.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   And of course if your grandparents, your parents, whoever is going to make the gift,
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.720]   the point is you can do that.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   And that's without ever coming up against a lifetime exclusion amount.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   And then of course, if we add to that the fact that even if you do contribute
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   more than $150,000 to the account, you still, in today's world,
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.720]   have an $11.4 million lifetime exclusion amount for your total gifts.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   So yes, you would file the return and start to accumulate those gifts made
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.720]   under that $11.4 million lifetime exclusion amount,
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   but you very conceivably could transfer $300,000 into an account.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   If you needed to, you just file the appropriate gift tax return.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   And it's a very rare person, especially not a mere mortal in today's world,
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   who is going to go up against the $11.4 million lifetime exclusion amount
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   per individual, $22.8 million lifetime exclusion amount for a couple.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   So we've got huge options here in where the 529 can be very, very useful.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   So the 529 account can be a wonderful account.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.720]   It allows you to put lots of money into it, lots of money into it now,
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   and it can be used for very useful things such as education expenses.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   Education expenses are usually the primary expense that wealthy people
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.720]   want to fund because they know that if you can educate a person well,
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   then they can figure everything else out in their life.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   So now that you can use it for primary, secondary, private school expenses
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.720]   to the tune of $10,000 per year and college expenses and graduate school expenses,
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   you've got a major opportunity here.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   And with the flexibility of 529 accounts to change the beneficiary
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   or to distribute the money out in times going by, there are huge benefits here.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.720]   So it's very much in our interest to know,
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   are 529 accounts protected from the claims of creditors?
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   And the answer is, of course, it depends on your state law
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.720]   and partly on the federal bankruptcy code.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   So my state, Florida, does protect explicitly and clearly 529 accounts.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   Florida protects Coverdell educational savings accounts, protects 529 accounts.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   It protects even Hurricane Savings accounts.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   So there's all kinds of protection possible in your state.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   So this means if you're the resident of a state that protects 529 accounts
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   and if you have educational savings goals for your children,
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   things like private school tuition, things like college tuition,
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:35.720]   and if you've had an event, a liquidity event where you have a lot of money,
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   you should seriously consider making contributions to a 529 account
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   because you can use it to protect those dollars
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   for something that's very important to you.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   If you're paying private school tuition for three or four children
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   and you're paying that each year and you have a liquidity event
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   and you're planning forward for college,
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   you should seriously consider making some big, big, big contributions
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   to the 529 account because there's so much flexibility
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   on your ability to get it out of the account if you ever need to.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   There's so much flexibility with your ability to change beneficiaries
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:16.720]   and to have it protected from creditors can be a major useful thing
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   for you to do to fund one of your primary goals.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   Now what about bankruptcy?
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   So in this case, it depends on the details.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   Now in the Federal Bankruptcy Code, specifically,
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   529 plan funds are excluded from the property of the bankruptcy estate.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   So that means that the bankruptcy trustee and creditors cannot collect
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.720]   from the fund under the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.720]   But there are specific limits that are important.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.720]   First, the beneficiary of the account must be your child, stepchild,
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   grandchild, or step-grandchild.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   So you can't just set up a 529 fund for yourself,
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.720]   file bankruptcy, and protect the money.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   Also here, the details of when you actually make the deposits
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   are a big, big deal.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.720]   Under the federal laws, any deposit made within 365 days
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   before your bankruptcy filing is not protected.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   Deposits made between 365 days and 720 days prior to your bankruptcy filing
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.720]   are exempt of up to $6,225 per beneficiary.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   And any deposit made over 720 days before filing bankruptcy is exempt.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.720]   That's the federal laws.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.720]   Your state may have different laws.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.720]   You should research your particular state.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.720]   The point is, from the perspective of asset protection,
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.720]   529s can be very, very useful.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   And long-term listeners to the show will know that I do not like 529 accounts
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   as a way for relatively poor people to just set aside $100 a month for education.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   I think that's a silly strategy.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.720]   You're not going to save a month, and the tax savings are going to be insignificant.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   But for wealthy people who have a liquidity event or who can put a lot of money up front,
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   I think 529 accounts have a huge potential for benefits.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.720]   Now, big drawback of 529 accounts, limited on your investment choices.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   So you're either limited to if you're involved in a prepaid tuition plan,
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   that, of course, is extremely limiting, and that's only going to be for college expenses,
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   or you're limited to whatever funds your particular state has chosen in your state's plan.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   Here, you would have to, of course, analyze it carefully to understand whether or not your state
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   will give you the state tax deduction.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   If your state provides for you with a state income tax deduction on 529 accounts,
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.720]   you'll have to analyze what state you can invest in and analyze those investment options.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   If you used a different state's funds, you may have a better choice,
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   but still you're going to have relatively mainstream funds.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.720]   That's a big drawback of 529 accounts.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   But with this asset protection perspective, if the shoe fits,
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   if you have those private school tuition for K-12 planned for yourself,
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   and/or if you are contributing money for college expenses and you plan to pay for retail prices for college, etc.,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   a 529 account is a very attractive tool given the creditor protection.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   Now, if only in the future we can get it to switch and also cover homeschool expenses,
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   I will become a much less grudging fan of 529 accounts.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.720]   Unfortunately, it's still to this day you can't use 529 accounts for homeschool expenses.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.720]   Now let's go to Coverdell Educational Savings Accounts.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.720]   Basically, everything's about the same.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.720]   The only problem, of course, is your contribution limits to a Coverdell Educational Savings Account
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   are much, much smaller.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.720]   So you can only contribute $2,000 per beneficiary per year.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:47.720]   And so it's much harder to accumulate any significant capital in a Coverdell Educational Savings Account.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:54.720]   But generally, the Coverdell Educational Savings Account has the same asset protection purposes as other tools,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:00.720]   and you have the significant flexibility of the distributions from the Coverdell Educational Savings Account.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.720]   And remember, of course, the easy transition for an ESA is you can always put it into a 529 account.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   If you ever start to reach the age 30 max on an ESA, you can just pop it over into a 529 account and you are covered.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:17.720]   But the Coverdell Educational Savings Account has the big benefit of more flexibility in the investment choices.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:24.720]   So if you are a hands-on investor and you are actively engaging in opportunities for investment
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:33.720]   where you have significant upside potential, you're taking risky bets on things that have big, big potential wins,
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.720]   and you can do a lot with a few thousand dollars, $2,000, $6,000, $10,000, $20,000.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:43.720]   If you can do a lot with that small amount of money, consider a Coverdell Educational Savings Account
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   because it can help you to fund your educational goals for your children, grandchildren, etc.,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:52.720]   while also protecting those funds from the claims of creditors.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:57.720]   Coverdells are cool. They just always have that brutal problem of not being able to get much money into them.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:03.720]   And I close with a discussion of UTMA, Uniform Transfer to Minors Act, and UGMA accounts.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   Now the good news is that UTMA and UGMA accounts are protected from the claims of creditors, generally,
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:16.720]   because when you legally contribute and make that UTMA or UGMA election,
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:21.720]   you're making a legal transfer of property from yourself to your children.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   And so because it's not your money anymore, even though you're the custodian of the account,
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.720]   your creditor doesn't have access to something just because you're a custodian of it.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   The money is legally your child's money.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.720]   The problem with a UTMA or UGMA account is I can't make any good argument for their use.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   Now like most things, I would imagine that somewhere, somebody could make a good argument for it.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   I could imagine that somebody could come up with a list of circumstances, a set of facts,
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   in which an UTMA or an UGMA account would be really useful and would really be the best solution.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   Somebody must be able to do that, in which case if they described that fact pattern to me,
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   I would say, "Yeah, absolutely, an UTMA or UGMA account is good."
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.720]   But I don't know what that account, that fact pattern is. I don't know what that argument is.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   Because in any fact pattern I can come up with, generally, there are almost always better tools available.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   UTMAs and UGMAs have so many disadvantages to them.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.720]   Now they have advantages, but they have so many disadvantages to them
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.720]   that I've never recommended one to somebody.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.720]   If you need one, if you can come up with a fact pattern in real life,
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   where it is actually a good solution for somebody,
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.720]   at least there you are getting some creditor protection.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   But unfortunately, I can't make a strong version of that argument at the moment.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.720]   I'd love to hear from you if you can.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   That is the extent of the discussion I want to make today on health and education account exemption planning.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   Most people don't think about these accounts from the perspective of their asset protection uses.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   Most people just think about them as, "Hey, it's allowing me to save money on taxes."
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.720]   Well, they don't really. For most people, actually save that much money on taxes.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   That's why I'm generally negative towards them.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   Most people don't need the tax savings, and the tax savings that they get are pretty insignificant.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   They just make people feel good because they're stashing some money aside for their kid's education.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.720]   But most people who use these accounts and fund them with some silly $200 a month,
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   you're not getting any major tax savings. It's basically immaterial.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   But if you are wealthy and have significant liquidity events,
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   you can use these education accounts for your own benefits.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:36.720]   You can get a lot of tax benefits if you can pre-fund them and invest at a healthy time.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   But if you can pre-fund them, then your earnings are substantial enough where the tax benefits are useful.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   And when you add in the creditor protection, asset protection perspective,
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.720]   and when you add in the estate planning usefulness of them for some people,
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   now I think you can make a much stronger argument for education accounts.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   For health accounts, I think you've just got one more notch in the feather of the...
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   Was that the right silly thing to say?
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   One more benefit for health savings accounts, if you can set them up.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   Health savings accounts can be really useful tools, and I think that the asset protection perspectives only enhance that.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.720]   That's it for health and education account exemption planning.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.720]   The next thing in this series is scheduled to be personal property exemptions.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   So stay tuned for that when we come back to this series very soon.
