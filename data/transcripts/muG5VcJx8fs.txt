[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   So thanks for that question, Andrew.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.400]   That does help clarify things.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.240]   All right, let's do one more, Jesse.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.200]   What do we got?
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.040]   - All right, final question is from Allison.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.640]   She's a 29 year old software developer in Washington, DC.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.880]   She says, "Hi Cal, in your previous podcast,
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.960]   "you talked about how you organize your life
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.680]   "and your core documents.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.660]   "How did you create your values document?
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.320]   "How do you know what values are important to you?"
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.720]   - Well, first of all, I'll say I'm distracted
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.520]   by our tablet here with the Reich animation
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.960]   I'm looking at right now.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.960]   My Lord, there's a histogram, a stacked histogram
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.140]   of task completion per person,
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.120]   stacked by the different categories of tasks
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.260]   moving up and down.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.960]   Man, okay, sorry, Allison.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.320]   I'm entranced by the visual complexity
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.080]   that is these project management tools.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.280]   Wait till they see our whiteboard, Jesse.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.180]   We're too simple.
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.680]   We have a whiteboard and Google Docs.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.680]   - Dropbox.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.600]   - We do use Dropbox, yeah.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.200]   No stacked histograms.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.040]   All right, Allison, I'm sorry.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.860]   This is an important question.
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.880]   Okay, how'd you come up with your values document?
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.800]   Here's the key thing about values documents,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.980]   which again, for people who didn't hear episode 211,
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.680]   my suggestion is you have a document
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.840]   that has your core values
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.500]   that you review on a regular basis.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.480]   It becomes the foundation for everything else you do.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.080]   So when you write your strategic plans
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.200]   for like what am I doing for the next semester,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.680]   all this stuff comes back to,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.480]   am I serving my core values?
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.720]   The key point about that
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.080]   is there's not a single right answer to that
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.960]   that you have to get just right
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.580]   before the document can be used.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.120]   Your notion of what your values were
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.440]   will evolve over time with experience and exposure
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.400]   to other systems of thought.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.360]   What's important is that you have something that makes sense
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.440]   and aligns with your experience intuition at the moment
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.920]   and that you're using it.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.800]   This gives you intention and direction with your life.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.040]   Even if that direction shifts over time,
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.260]   you're still always better moving at any one moment
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.240]   in an intentional direction
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.640]   as opposed to just wandering around.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.040]   So otherwise I'm gonna try to say here,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.440]   Alison is lower the stakes here.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.240]   I wrote my original values document,
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.560]   I was in my twenties as a grad student.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.760]   For some reason I remember this.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.880]   I have a weird memory for certain things.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.040]   I wrote in my Moleskine
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.120]   and it was, we were waiting to go to sit Shiva
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.160]   with a friend of ours,
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.480]   a friend of ours who was at Harvard, a grad student,
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.480]   whose dad had died.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.520]   So his dad had died young
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.440]   and we were gonna go sit Shiva
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.600]   and it gets you thinking about things.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   And I remember that's when the very first draft
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.000]   and I'm sure I have that Moleskine somewhere.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.760]   I have a stack this high of these old Moleskines
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.880]   where I keep track of ideas about my values
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.080]   and living the deep life.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.560]   That's why I worked out my first value plan
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.200]   and this has evolved since then.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.320]   Getting married changed that.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.880]   I mean, I was married at that point already.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.680]   Having kids changed the values plan.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.240]   Career shifting changed the values plan.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.640]   If you encounter or discover systems of,
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.080]   organized systems of moralistic thinking,
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.520]   be it philosophical or theological,
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.240]   now you're tapping into really ancient wisdom,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.320]   gonna affect your value plan.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.520]   So the thing will evolve,
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.480]   but you do, you gotta start.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.440]   You wanna have something.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.840]   So that's the way to think about it, Alison.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.200]   Having something is better than not.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.360]   Don't sweat if you have the right thing
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.120]   because that will evolve with your life experience.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.640]   - So you keep all your Moleskines?
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.640]   - Yeah.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   - For century 20s?
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.160]   - Yeah.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.600]   I keep Moleskines.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   - I guess if you go back and look,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.760]   you can kind of see it's like a diary.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.160]   - I keep a lot, not all of them.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.080]   I also have a lot of time blocking.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.560]   So I have a lot of these old planners
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.120]   and then the ones I was a lot of black and reds from before.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.960]   I don't keep all of those.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.280]   I realized like I don't need all these,
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.680]   but I have a fair number of those.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.720]   Yeah, but the Moleskines I keep.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.400]   I've gone back through before.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.200]   There's some, I've done blog posts from now and then
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.240]   or email newsletter articles every once in a while
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.840]   where I'll take a picture of like the teetering stack.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.680]   - Yeah.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.160]   - I last went through them for digital minimalism.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.200]   This, I was writing about journaling
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.440]   in digital minimalism.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.720]   And so I actually went back and cited a bunch of things
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.680]   from old Moleskines.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.160]   It's kind of cool to go back.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.000]   - Yeah.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.760]   - Go back and read.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.600]   I mean, you, you get older, your thoughts mature
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.520]   is what I would say.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.200]   That's my, that's my experience going back
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.840]   and reading my 20, 21 year old Moleskines.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.680]   But there's cool things.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.960]   I mean, the coolest thing I found was the transition
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.880]   in my writing life when I was leaving student writing
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.400]   and trying to make that decision
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.920]   because I'd written three books for students.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.160]   My newsletter slash blog was called study hacks
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.120]   and it was just for students.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.000]   It had traction.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.680]   I was probably one of the top people writing on that topic.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.520]   I was like, I can just own this topic.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.440]   Like I'm owning it now.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.760]   I brought some new things into that world.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.960]   I was working.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.120]   And then also I was thinking,
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.680]   I can't just do this for the rest of my life though.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.520]   Like I'm not gonna be a student forever.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.400]   And like, do I want to just keep doing this?
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.120]   And I worked a lot of that out in my Moleskine.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.280]   And I have a weird, my wife knows this.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.760]   I don't have a fully memetic memory, right?
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.520]   Like I don't have photographic memory
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.040]   but I do for certain things like books.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.880]   I can remember like almost every book where I read it
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.560]   where I was anytime I'm writing or reading.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.080]   So I have a very clear memory.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.280]   And this must have been God, 2008.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.240]   Very clear memory, Coolidge Corner,
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.360]   movie theater, Brookline, Massachusetts.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.600]   Because my wife and I used to see every movie,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.000]   literally every movie.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.960]   And we were there to see,
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.440]   it was a Disney nature documentary
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.720]   about lions and lion cubs.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.560]   'Cause we just saw it.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.160]   We've seen everything what's playing, right?
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.560]   And I remember being in the main theater
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.280]   at Coolidge Corner, the main, the nice one
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.880]   that has the old-fashioned theater
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.760]   with the curtains or whatever.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.600]   And we were watching that movie.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.440]   And I remember sitting there with my Moleskine
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.680]   and working through.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.560]   So if I see those notes,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.240]   I can remember where I was when I took them.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.080]   - That's great.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.960]   (upbeat music)
