[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   I should like to call your attention this evening to that incident recorded in the fifth
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.480]   chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, beginning at verse 33 and going on to the
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.640]   end of the chapter. The incident, the account of which we have read together at the beginning
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:27.880]   and which opens like this in verse 33. "When they heard that, they were cut to the heart
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:36.600]   and took counsel to slay." Now this obviously follows from what has been previously recorded,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.040]   and most of you I'm sure will remember that what has been recorded has been the account
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:50.760]   of the trial of the apostles, the representatives of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. They'd
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.920]   been arrested because of their preaching and teaching and because of the miracle that they'd
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.000]   worked on the poor men who had been born lame, who was to be found seated daily at the beautiful
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.080]   gate of the temple. They'd been arrested, two of them, at Ennerid more than once. But
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.120]   now they're all under arrest and here they are brought before the council, and this was
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.600]   the charge brought against them. "Did not we straightly commend you that you should
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.120]   not teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.560]   to bring this man's blood upon us." Then we are given the reply of the apostles, speaking
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.840]   particularly through the apostle Peter. "Then Peter and the other apostles answered and
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.200]   said, 'We are to obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.600]   you slew and hanged upon a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:02.280]   and a savior, for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.680]   of these things. And so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.'"
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.120]   Then comes this word. "When they heard that, they were cut to the heart and took counsel
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.200]   to slay them." But then you remember this man Gamaliel, one of their own company, a
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.520]   Pharisee, stood up and reasoned with them and persuaded them not to kill the apostles
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.320]   there and then. So we are told that to him they agreed, and when they had called the
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.000]   apostles and beaten them, they commended them that they should not speak in the name of
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.080]   Jesus and let them go. And the story ends with this wonderful and amazing description
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.960]   of these men, threatened like this with death at one moment and only set free for the time,
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.880]   going on their way rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.840]   And how they went on preaching and teaching in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.760]   Well now, here you see we are looking at the reaction of this great council at Jerusalem
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:22.440]   called the Sanhedrin to the statement and the answer of the apostles. They have put
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   their case, they have put it reasonably, they have put it briefly, but this is the reaction
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:36.560]   of the council. They were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them. Now this is
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.160]   the thing to which I want to call your attention. You noticed, and those who were here last
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.760]   Sunday night will remember, that the apostle ended his statement by saying that the Holy
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.680]   Ghost is also a witness to these things, the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.360]   obey him. And we made the point that the gospel is always something that calls for obedience,
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.760]   not something just to be listened to intellectually, not something just to be held in the mind
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.600]   as very interesting and perhaps even a thrilling philosophy and view of life. No, no, the gospel
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.920]   is something that has got to be obeyed. If it doesn't affect our lives, any belief we
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.640]   may think we have in it is of no value whatsoever. It does call for a surrender. It calls for
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.120]   a total allegiance. It is either to govern our lives or really we have nothing to do
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.200]   with it. Now that being the case about the gospel, it must of necessity always produce
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.400]   a response. It is impossible for anybody to listen to this gospel without responding to
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.600]   it. And you respond to it either, I say, by submitting to it, obeying it, or else by not
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.080]   doing so. And it's amazing to me always, and increasingly amazing, that in the New Testament
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:15.800]   we are given an account of these varying responses. The gospel always produces some result. And
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:23.440]   here we are shown that very plainly and very clearly. The New Testament very honestly gives
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.700]   us a picture of the church and her preaching and what followed. And what proves it to me
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.240]   to be a divinely inspired account is this, that it isn't a worked up account, it isn't
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:45.360]   a picture of universal success, everything going well. Quite the reverse. Men, of course,
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.520]   always try to do that. We always produce a good balance sheet. We always have good results,
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.280]   and we report them and we boost them. The New Testament doesn't do that. It's an honest
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.200]   document and it tells us the bad as well as the good, the poor results as well as the
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.160]   good results. Nothing is concealed at all. It's the truth of God, and it is truth. But
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:16.720]   it's not only true history. I believe this has been specially recorded for us in order
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.360]   that we may learn certain valuable lessons from it. Have you ever thought of that? Why
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.280]   are we given a record such as this one, and it's only one of many? Why are we given this
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.680]   account at all? Well, to me there's only one answer. It is in order that we may see in
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:43.120]   the persons of others some of the great fallacies that afflict the human mind with respect to
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:50.720]   this gospel. I believe they're specially recorded in order that we might learn from them. Now,
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.880]   we're all aware of this, are we not? But it's always much easier to learn a lesson when
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.080]   you get it through somebody else rather than when it comes to you directly. We're always
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.960]   on the self-defensive, are we not? We don't like to be addressed too directly, but we
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.920]   can see things in another. You remember the old story in the Old Testament, how Nathan
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.040]   the prophet went to David. David had committed a terrible sin, but he was quite happy about
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.520]   it. Everything seemed all right, and they couldn't do anything with him. But God sent
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.720]   his servant Nathan the prophet to David, and Nathan, very wisely, didn't tackle David
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:31.360]   directly. He went about it indirectly, the strategy of the indirect approach. Nathan
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.840]   told David a story about a very grave injustice that one person was guilty of with respect
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.320]   to another, and David was listening with animation. And Nathan put the case before him, and David
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.600]   was filled with a sense of righteous indignation. He says, "This is all wrong. Something must
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.720]   be done to punish this man." Then Nathan looked at him and said, "Thou art the man." You see,
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.920]   David could see it in the other when he couldn't see it in himself. And we're all remarkably
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:05.800]   like David. We're all on very good terms with ourselves. We are experts at explaining everything
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.600]   when we are the person's concern. So it's a very good way of seeing the fallacy of our
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.080]   position to look at it in somebody else. And I believe that God, in his infinite mercy
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:23.160]   and kindness, has given us these accounts and stories of these reactions to the gospel
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:32.120]   in order that we may see the thing. And God grant that we may see ourselves, some of us,
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:40.520]   as we look at the case of this Sanhedrin. Here, you see, we see unbelief in one of its
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.840]   particular forms clearly depicted. It isn't the only one, but it is one. Here is unbelief
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:56.640]   blatant, violent, determining to kill these people and to put an end to this thing. That's
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.200]   only one of the forms. It's the one we're going to look at tonight. Now, why is this
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:11.720]   important to us? Well, it's important for this reason. There are many reasons, indeed.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.820]   One good reason is this, that through an incident like this, we are unable to understand the
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:25.680]   world as it is tonight. Why is the world as it is? Why all the trouble and the anguish
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:32.080]   and the pain? Why all the misery? Why all the failure? Why, I say, especially in view of
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:39.800]   respect that there is a gospel which can put it right. Why does the world reject it? That's
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:46.080]   the great question. Now, I think this incident helps us to understand it. And what it does,
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:54.640]   of course, is to show us the depth of human sin. The tragedy of all tragedies in the modern
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:01.120]   world is that however much we may be aware of our problems, we are still not aware of
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:08.480]   the depth of our problems, the real nature of our problems. You know, while people still
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.160]   go on thinking that politics and education and culture can solve the problems of the
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.680]   human race, there is no hope whatsoever. That's the tragedy, especially, of this twentieth
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:27.360]   century. You see, we have believed in this century that we can put things right. We've
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.880]   got the knowledge, we've got everything. But look at our world. It's deteriorating
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:41.960]   rapidly, openly before our eyes. When will we realize the nature of the problem? When
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:48.200]   will we realize that the real problem is sin in the human heart, and the depths of sin?
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:54.920]   Now, in looking at an incident such as this, we are given an insight into that. Here it
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.880]   is, openly before us, and it's exactly the same in the world this evening.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.560]   Now, let's look at these people, therefore. This great Sanhedrin, and don't forget,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.720]   these were the most important people. They were the most important people in Jerusalem.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.760]   You'll get a description of them at the beginning of the fourth chapter. We've already seen
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:24.760]   it. The Sanhedrin consisted of the priests, Sadducees. Not only that, Anastai, priest,
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.280]   Caiaphas, John, Alexander, as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, the rulers,
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:36.240]   the elders, the scribes, the leading people, the religious leaders, the political leaders,
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.320]   the greatest thinkers of the age. They were all there. They are the people who react like
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.640]   this to the plea and to the message of the apostles.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:53.480]   Now, as we look at their reaction, and study it, and listen to what they say and what they
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:12:02.800]   propose to do, we shall, I say, be given an insight into the real nature of man and regenerate
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:10.280]   without God. And it is enforced for us by the advice that was given to the Sanhedrin
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.320]   by this man, Gamaliel, who was one of their company, one of their number.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.760]   Now then, what are the principles? Well, now, what I've tried to do is to extract the principles
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:27.880]   out of this incident, because they're here quite plainly. The first thing is this. Unbelief
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:35.480]   is obviously and clearly not something new. Why do I start with that? Well, I start with
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:42.120]   that for this reason. The popular assumption today is that there is something quite new
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.440]   about the way in which people are rejecting the gospel. You know the common way in which
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.800]   it's put. They say, "What? You don't still believe that? Surely, surely, they say, everybody
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:00.880]   knows by now that it's only a myth. By now, you see." The assumption is that this is something
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:07.000]   quite new, and that the average person today who doesn't believe the gospel doesn't believe
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.880]   it simply because he happens to be alive now. It's assumed that if he were alive a hundred
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.680]   years ago, he would undoubtedly have been a Christian. The popular common idea is that
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.840]   in the past, everybody were Christians because they didn't know any better. It was the stage
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.080]   of civilization at which they'd arrived, and everybody believed this sort of thing, the
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:33.280]   supernatural and the miraculous and so on. But now, the modern man, quite new, and that
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:40.200]   there's never been such a thing as a rejection of the gospel until this present century.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.560]   Well, now, I mustn't waste your time. You see, this one story, if we've got nothing
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:53.160]   else, is more than enough to show that that is just sheer ignorance, nothing but ignorance.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:14:01.880]   That's sheer self-deceit. Here at the very beginning, the gospel was rejected in exactly
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.920]   the same way as it's being rejected today. You go back 1,900 years and more, and here
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:13.840]   is the very thing that people are boasting of as the hallmark of modernity. The modern
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:20.320]   man, of course, he doesn't believe the gospel because he is the modern man. But my dear
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:27.920]   friend, there's nothing new about that. You see, it's as old as Christianity itself.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.320]   Now, there's the first thing we notice. And then, of course, another way in which it's
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:43.640]   often put is this, that what makes the modern man reject the gospel is his new knowledge.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.840]   Oh, what pride there is in this tonight. People say, "Surely you don't believe that any
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.160]   longer in the light of modern science, the new science, and so on." You can't possibly
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.760]   go on believing all that. And they do believe. Now, I'm probably addressing people who believe
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:06.720]   that very thing themselves at this moment, that it is because of some new knowledge that
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:13.000]   we possess. I've got to go on repeating this because the opposite is being repeated so
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.320]   much. You know, the value of one soul is such that I'll go on repeating it as long as there's
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:24.520]   one man left who goes on believing such nonsense. People believe that they're rejecting the
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:32.960]   gospel because of the splitting of the atom. That that somehow has made belief in the gospel
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.560]   impossible. And if only they'd been born in an era before men had done this and before
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.960]   science had so advanced in this marvelous manner, they would have believed the gospel.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.800]   My friend, if you've got nothing but this one incident, it's enough to show you the
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:53.360]   complete fallacy of that argument. Here were people who rejected the gospel in exactly
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:02.720]   the same way as the modern men. Modern knowledge has nothing to do with this whatsoever. I
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.000]   could easily prove that to you in almost endless ways. Look at it like this. Take your modern
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.500]   knowledge. It's all right. I'm not here to say a word against it. A man who says anything
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.600]   against this knowledge is a fool. It's marvelous. It's wonderful. I agree with you. Split the
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:24.840]   atom. Conquer the force of gravity. It's amazing. All right. I'm with you 100%. But all I'm
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   asking you is this. What has that got to do with men as men? What has that got to do with
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:42.800]   the moral problem? Look at this horrible case this last week. That was committed, you know,
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:50.440]   the men split the atom. Isn't it about time we began to think clearly and straightly?
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:58.480]   What we are concerned about with here is man and God and life and living and morality and
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:05.960]   purity and cleanliness and chastity and honesty. And all your modern knowledge doesn't affect,
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:12.400]   doesn't touch any one of these things at all. Doesn't make the slightest difference. The
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.080]   modern knowledge casts no light upon death nor upon eternity. We're in exactly the same
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:26.040]   position as these people in the first century. Let's get rid of that idea. Now, my dear friends,
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.480]   we've got to start thinking. We're all the creatures of prejudices. We repeat slogans
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:38.120]   and cliches. We say nobody any longer. Stop and examine that statement. Drop that any
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.840]   longer. It's got nothing to do with it. Time doesn't come into this at all. The problem
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:50.160]   is the same today as it was in the first century as it was even before that. This is a universal
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:56.520]   problem ever since men has got into a fallen state and condition. Very well, there's the
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:04.920]   first thing. It's here on the surface. But let's go on to a second one. Unbelief is not
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:15.000]   only not based upon modern knowledge, it is not based either upon reason and intellect
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:26.240]   and understanding. Here's the second great popular modern fallacy, isn't it? Men think
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:33.920]   today that he's not religious because he's reasoning, ability, brain, logic, understanding.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.480]   All right, he says, I'll accept your point about the knowledge, but my claim is that
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:44.600]   any thinking man, any man who rarely uses his brains and reason, you see, the idea is
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:53.200]   that religion is just a sort of soft stuff. Emotionalism, the dope of the masses, opium
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.280]   of the people, those are the terms that have been used and they've been swallowed and they've
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.520]   been believed and repeated ad nauseum. The idea is, you see, that a man who's a Christian
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:09.040]   is just a man who doesn't think. He abandons thought, he commits intellectual suicide,
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.800]   allows himself to become emotional, go soft. These and various other terms are the ones
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:20.240]   that have always been used. So you see, the picture is that the unbeliever is a man who's
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:27.680]   controlled entirely by his brain and by his thinking. No emotion, no feeling, brain, understanding,
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:34.000]   thought. Well, all right. All I say is, let's examine these people here, the members of
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.480]   the Sanhedrin in the light of that contingent. And I think I should be able to prove to you
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:47.400]   by reasoning, without much difficulty, that unbelief, far from being based on reason and
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:57.080]   intellect, is nothing but sheer irrationality, utterly unreasonable, with nothing to be said
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:04.480]   in its defense. Now that's a strong statement. I'm here to substantiate it. Look at the position
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:12.720]   here. There are the members of the Sanhedrin. Here are these apostles. Now these members
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.360]   of the Sanhedrin, we are told, when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:25.040]   to slay them, they wanted to kill the apostles. But wait a minute, let's ask a few questions.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:33.400]   Why did they want to kill them? What had these apostles done? What crime had they committed?
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:40.920]   What law had they broken? What evidence can be produced against them? And the answer is
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:50.760]   that there was literally none. They were innocent men. They hadn't broken any law. There's nothing
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:55.560]   that can be said against them at all. Now you notice, and that was why I read that section
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.800]   out of the 15th chapter of the Gospel according to St. John at the beginning, these men are
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.560]   just getting the treatment that our Lord had had before them. He told them that it was
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.120]   going to happen. He understood men. He knew it all. The Son of God, you see, had exactly
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.720]   the same treatment. They did their utmost to bring a charge against him and they completely
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.080]   failed, completely. And yet they killed him. And here they are now wanting to kill his
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:26.560]   followers without any evidence whatsoever. Now I'm just asking a question. Is this reason?
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:36.000]   Is this being reasonable? Is this the calm, dispassionate, logical surveying of a situation?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.120]   You can't say that, can you? But now, my friends, let's examine ourselves. Ask yourself all
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:47.440]   along as I'm making these points, why am I rejecting this? Am I like the members of this
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.560]   Sanhedrin? But then look at another thing. Not only, I say, was there no charge against
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.760]   these men, no reason for killing them whatsoever, but look at what these men have just been
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.960]   saying. Look at their message. What have they been saying? This is what they've been saying.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:10.080]   The God of our fathers raised up Jesus. You slew him and hanged him on a tree, but him
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.440]   hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior, for to give repentance
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:22.520]   to Israel and forgiveness of sins. What have they been saying? Well, they've been saying
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:27.280]   something which is the best and the most glorious and wonderful good news that has ever come
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:33.080]   into the world. Their preaching and their teaching and their statement to the Sanhedrin
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:40.360]   was not that God was out to condemn the world and that God hated mankind and that God was
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.560]   going to mete out to men and women the punishment that they most richly deserve. It wasn't that.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:51.560]   It was the exact opposite. Their message was this, that God, in spite of mankind, in spite
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.760]   of the world, in spite of all our rebellion and all that we've done, that God's love
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:03.760]   was so great that he'd sent his only son, this Jesus, into the world in order to make
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:11.880]   a way of salvation for us, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. They were
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:18.680]   just telling people and telling the members of the Sanhedrin that God was offering to
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.600]   forgive them their sins, was offering to pardon them, whatever they may have done. They'd
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.320]   actually killed his son, but even that could be forgiven if they'd but repent and acknowledge
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.800]   it and ask God for mercy. God's message was already, "I have provided the way whereby
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.120]   I can give it to you. I have transferred your sins to him. It is free. I offer you this
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:50.040]   great salvation." Not only that, he offered to give them a new start, a new life, a new
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:56.160]   nature, a new being, a new everything. This is the message of the Gospel. It isn't I
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.240]   am saying this. This is what our Lord himself had preached. This is what these disciples
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:07.480]   were now preaching. They were offering men and women to be reconciled to God, to have
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   their past sins blotted out, to have a new start in life, a new power, new desires, a
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.160]   new hope, that God would be their Father, and all that they stood in need of. This is
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:25.800]   what they were being offered. And yet, you see, the effect of this message upon these
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:34.160]   people is to make them take counsel together to slay them. My dear friend, have you ever
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:40.320]   thought of it like that? Why does the modern man reject this Gospel? What's wrong with
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.680]   the Gospel? What's wrong with this message? Now, it's treated with sarcasm, with scorn,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:52.280]   with derision. People hate it, and they are insulting about it. But why? What is there
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:58.080]   that can be said against the message of this Gospel? I've often put it to you like this.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.200]   Let me put it again. If only everybody in the world tonight were living according to
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:10.640]   the Ten Commandments, our world would most certainly not be as it is. If only everybody
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.440]   on earth tonight were living according to the Sermon on the Mount, you wouldn't have
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.960]   your problems in this country, your industrial problems, your moral problems, your social
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.440]   problems. You wouldn't have problems in any nation. You wouldn't have problems between
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:33.200]   the nations. There'd be no war anywhere on earth if only everybody lived like this. If
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:38.800]   only everybody lived as a son of God, with a new nature and with the Holy Spirit in him
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:47.120]   as the gift of God, I say the world would be revolutionized. That's the message. Why
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:54.200]   do people reject this message? Is that reasonable? Is it reasonable to reject a message that
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:02.480]   offers you a free pardon, full forgiveness, regeneration, being born again, new nature,
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:08.400]   new power, new hopes, aspirations, and the glory of God awaiting you when you die and
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:16.080]   go on into the eternal world? What is the reason for rejecting it? Come now. You see,
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.440]   that's the sort of question that the modern man doesn't face. She says, "Of course,
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.360]   I'm not a Christian, because I reason and because I think." Well, now, my friend,
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.120]   I'm asking you to apply your reason. Where does your reason lead you to? Does it help
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.320]   you really to live? Does it help you to understand the problems of life? Does it help you to
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:37.440]   live as a decent individual? And what is the objection to this gospel that offers you all
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:46.400]   this and which demonstrably is a true message because these very men are witnesses to it?
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:56.200]   This isn't reason. This is unreason. This is irrationality. And then let's go on. These
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:01.720]   men are arrested and they're now wanting to kill them. What have they done? I say they've
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.600]   broken the law. All right, but what have they done? Well, what they've actually done is
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:12.480]   to heal a man who was born lame. There was evidence of this because the lame man was
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.000]   standing before them. They'd seen him. Everybody knew him. Everybody knew this poor fellow
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.200]   laid at the beautiful gate of the temple. He was over 40 years of age and he'd been
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.800]   put there for years and years and years. And the members of the Sanhedrin, when they went
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   into the temple to offer their prayers, they had to pass him. Everybody knew him. There
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:36.040]   he was standing solidly on his feet before them, able to walk, leaping, anything, praising
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:46.120]   God. Concrete evidence. These men have done that and yet they want to kill them. Is this
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:52.280]   reasonable? What has been the influence and the effect of the Christian church and the
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:57.960]   Christian gospel throughout the running centuries? That's the sort of question the modern man
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:05.560]   needs to ask. What does this gospel do? What does the Christian do? What has he done throughout
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:12.720]   the centuries? Well, I could keep you for many long hours in telling you that story.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:19.560]   It's now agreed by everybody that when the Goths and the Vandals sacked Rome and ruined
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:27.160]   it and conquered it, what was preserved even of civilization was preserved by the Christian
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:37.320]   church. In the so-called dark ages this was the only light. You can't understand the history
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:44.360]   of modern Europe apart from the Protestant Reformation. There has been no greater civilizing
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:51.760]   force in the history of the human race than this gospel preached by the Christian church.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:58.000]   Where did your poor law commence? It was started by the Christian church centuries before the
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.520]   politicians ever thought about it. Where did your education come from? It was started by
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:09.720]   the Christian church again centuries before your politicians ever thought about it. These
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.920]   men are the men who scoff at the Christian faith, the Christian religion. These were
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.760]   the people who have been teaching us in this century that you no longer need God and the
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.440]   supernatural. They can do it all by acts of parliament. Before they ever thought of these
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.800]   things the church was already doing it and doing it in a more successful manner than
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:35.160]   they are. And so I could take you through the list. Where did your hospitals come from?
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:44.320]   The oldest hospital in London, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, founded by a monk over 800 years
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:51.920]   ago. And all these greatest and best and most beneficent institutions, they have all come
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:57.280]   through the medium of these people. Yet these are the people that the world wants to kill
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.080]   and to destroy. And the modern man thinks he's clever in dismissing them with derision.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:09.600]   Is this reason? My dear friends, the whole trouble is that people no longer think. They're
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:16.360]   repeating the clichés. The clichés of the comedians and the clever columnists of the
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:23.600]   present time in the newspapers, the sneerers, the men of the innuendos and the insinuations.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:29.040]   They're just repeating their clichés. Think for yourself, my dear friend. Acquaint yourself
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.680]   with the facts. And I think you'll soon find that unbelief is not based on reason. It's
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:41.120]   the absence of reason. And then take the final manifestation of the unreason of these people.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:47.880]   They want to kill these men at once. D'Amelio gets up and says, "Look here, be careful."
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.520]   And he persuades them. Apparently, they decide that they won't put them to death. But even
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:59.360]   then, you see, they only half listen to him. He tells them to let these men go. He says,
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.000]   "Now I say unto you, refrain from these men and let them alone. For if this counsel or
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.400]   this work be of men, it will come to naught. But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.040]   it, lest happily you be found even to fight against God." And to him they agreed, but
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:19.520]   they didn't agree even with that. And when they had called the apostles and beaten them,
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.720]   he told them not to do that. But they did it. They commended that they should not speak
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.800]   in the name of Jesus and let them go. They only half listen even to D'Amelio. They don't
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.600]   kill them, but then they beat them. They had no more reason for beating them than they
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:38.180]   had for killing them. But this, you see, is a manifestation of this utter irrationality.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.800]   But come, let us leave that and go to the next point. The positive thing that we are
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.560]   taught here is this, that unbelief is not dependent upon modern knowledge. It is not
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.520]   dependent upon reason. What is it dependent on? What is it that produces it? Ah, well,
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:57.080]   the answer is obviously and simply, it's a matter of the heart. It is always a matter
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:04.240]   of feeling. Men never reject the gospel because of intellect. It is always because of morality.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.400]   It is always because of the state of the human heart. The very words tell us that when they
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:15.800]   heard that, they were cut to the heart. It's a very powerful term, this. It really means
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.320]   they were cut asunder. Their hearts, as it were, were broken in two. Why? Well, there
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:29.360]   was such sharp vexation within them that it amounted to an inward rage. They were bursting,
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:34.960]   almost in a literal sense, in their desire to kill the apostles. Now, this, I say, is
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:45.720]   not reason. It is rage. Rage. It is a raving mania, nothing less. How different are these
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.840]   people, the members of the Sanhedrin, to the people we read of in the second chapter of
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:58.040]   this book of Acts? There I see Peter preaching to a crowd. And what I read of them is this.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:04.280]   Now, when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.880]   the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" You see the difference
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.200]   between pricked in the heart and torn asunder in your heart? It's a good thing to be pricked
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.760]   in the heart. That means that you're disturbed, that you're convicted, that you're aroused,
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:26.240]   you're made to see the thing, and it leads you to repentance. But here it's a blind rage,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:32.720]   which puts the mind and its operations on one side and is just filled with passionate,
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:43.520]   insensate, vituperative rage. That was the cause of this unbelief. Though it's a court,
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:50.920]   you see, a court that tries people and all the paraphernalia of a court. There's no
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:34:00.000]   reason there. It's blind rage. It's passionate feeling. It is something utterly insensate.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:08.520]   But what causes this? Now, you see, I'm doing all this not because we are interested in
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:17.240]   this old Sanhedrin of so long ago. I am calling your attention to it, as I said at the beginning,
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.640]   because it's such a perfect representation and portrayal of the case of the modern men.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:29.440]   There's no difference. Have you seen any difference so far? There is none at all. Why, I ask,
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.840]   are these men so furious? Why are they filled with such a rage against these apostles? Why
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.640]   do they want to kill them? Well, here are some of the answers. It is partly a matter
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:47.600]   of conscience. They're obviously troubled about the way in which they crucified the
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:53.000]   Lord Jesus Christ. They've already said that. Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:01.440]   doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. They knew that it was upon them.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:08.280]   They knew that they'd crucified him. They'd rejected him. They wouldn't listen. They said,
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:14.600]   "Yes, away with him." They pleaded with Pilate to put an end to him. The Jews, their own men,
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.640]   the men who'd come up amongst them, they're the ones who plead with Pilate. Pilate was
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.200]   trying to set him free, but they insisted upon his being crucified. And you know, you
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:28.320]   can't do a thing like that and live at ease. The conscience operates, and they're reminded
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:35.400]   of it by the apostle. "The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:44.120]   on a tree." And their consciences were condemning them. And a troubled conscience is always
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:50.800]   something that tends to infuriate us. They were annoyed. This thing was there, and they
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.680]   wanted to get rid of it. Oh, men and women fight against the gospel. They pretend the
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.280]   reasons are intellectual. The real reasons, I say, are moral, and they're generally in
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:10.520]   the realm of the conscience. We are covering up ourselves and our misdeeds. There is something
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:16.760]   in us that tells us that this is absolutely right, but we don't want to do it. We know
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:22.100]   it's right, but we prefer the darkness. As our Lord put it, "This is the condemnation
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:27.600]   that light has come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light because their
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:33.280]   deeds were evil." And we fight against our conscience. We kick against the pricks, like
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:38.520]   Saul of Tarsus did later on. We are fighting with that within us which tells you this is
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:43.960]   right, but we don't want it to be right. Isn't that the real trouble at this present
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:50.560]   hour? The difficulty about the gospel is, you know, that it inculcates a life of obedience
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:58.400]   to God's laws. And the natural man doesn't like God's laws. The natural man prefers to
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.720]   be promiscuous rather than to be faithful to his wife. He wants premarital experiences
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:08.360]   which he shouldn't have, but the gospel says no. The Ten Commandments says, "Thou shalt
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:14.440]   not." The modern man says, "I want." That's why he hates the gospel. It's not reason,
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:21.280]   as I've shown you. It's what he likes. And this gospel, it disturbs him, and his conscience
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.920]   attests the disturbance. And he's fighting against his conscience, and it's a miserable
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:34.160]   state to be in. It drives one to a fury. What else? Well, here's another factor.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:39.920]   They were annoyed by these apostles. Why? Well, because they've already described them
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:48.560]   as ignorant and unlearned men. Unlearned and ignorant men. Yet, you see, you are these
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.480]   unlearned and ignorant men addressing the crowds and the people listening to them, and
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:05.200]   they're having great success. And this infuriates them. And this is partly still the explanation
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:13.040]   of unbelief. There is something in man that makes him say, "A gospel that was true nearly
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:20.000]   two thousand years ago cannot possibly be adequate for the twentieth century." Now,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.280]   this is again another of those prejudices by which we are all governed by nature. We
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:30.880]   start, I say, by saying, "Of necessity, in the twentieth century we are in an advantageous
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:41.280]   position." And therefore, to be offered a gospel that was true and acceptable to men
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:49.120]   in the first century and in all the subsequent centuries is an insult to the modern man.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:53.320]   That's exactly what the Sanhedrin felt. "Who are these men?" they say. "What do they know?
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:39:00.840]   They've had no teaching, they've had no learning. We are the teachers, we are the Sanhedrin."
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:07.720]   And so, you see, this element of pride of intellect always comes in. Don't we all know
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:17.040]   something about this? How can the same gospel be adequate for a great philosopher as for
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:22.200]   a man who's never read a book in his life? It seems wrong to us, doesn't it? It seems
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:28.120]   quite insulting to us. Here it is. "Who are these men? These men setting themselves up
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:34.480]   as teachers. The ordinary Christians of the centuries claiming that they can teach us
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:40.520]   in the twentieth century. The thing is monstrous." But, you see, this isn't reason. What's it
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.640]   matter how old the teaching is? It isn't the age of the teaching that matters, it's the
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:50.800]   character. It is the quality of the teaching that matters. But, you see, man governed by
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:57.120]   prejudice doesn't stop to think that. He's governed merely by his feelings. And so, intellectual
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:05.560]   pride still comes in. And a man says, "Surely you're not asking me to believe with my brains
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:11.600]   and knowledge and understanding. What you say can save the most ignorant person in any
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   part of the world at this moment." But that's exactly what the gospel does. It humbles us,
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:28.520]   it hurts our pride, and then when we find that we can't understand it, the whole situation
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:36.280]   becomes aggravated and quite impossible. What is this gospel? How can these ignorant men
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.800]   speak like this? How can these ignorant men work these miracles as they're doing? What
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.760]   is this? And we don't understand it. You see, we understand, we think something about the
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:51.520]   atom and about all these other marvelous things, but here is something we can't understand.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.400]   And so we say, "It's supernatural, it's nonsense, we can't follow it." And so it is dismissed.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:02.880]   That's not reason, that is, again, I say, sure, passion.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:14.800]   But then I think we come to the greatest source of trouble, and that is that this gospel always
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:25.360]   tells us the truth about ourselves, and nothing else does that. That is always the final trouble
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:34.160]   with the gospel. It is a message that comes to us and tells us something like this, that
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:42.280]   we are all sinners, that our great brains and our great knowledge make not the slightest
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:50.560]   difference. We are all sinners. The great geniuses have been as great in their moral
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:42:00.960]   failure as anybody else. Drunkenness is not confined to the ignorant. You can get men
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:07.480]   of the greatest culture, who are alcoholics and slaves, to drink. And so this message
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:14.560]   tells us that. Nothing else does. Every other message praises our knowledge, our learning,
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:19.960]   our brains, our understanding. Here is the only message that comes to us, and with its
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:27.280]   honesty it says, "You are a sinner like everybody else. There is no difference. All have sinned
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:34.200]   and come short of the glory of God. There is none righteous, no, not one. Every man
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:44.360]   is a failure. Every man is blind and dead in trespasses and sins." That is what it
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:52.800]   tells us. But it goes beyond that and tells us that we are absolutely helpless in the
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:43:00.840]   matter of delivering ourselves out of this condition. And this is again, of course, a
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:05.480]   terrible insult to men, especially the modern men, with their self-confidence. Is there
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:12.320]   anything men cannot do? Look what he's doing. You say men can't save himself. You say
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:17.280]   men can't put himself right. But this is insulting to men. Look at the knowledge we
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.040]   have. Look at our psychology. Look at our sociology. Look at all our learning. Look
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:27.400]   at our familiarity with the great philosophers. Surely, by the application of this, we can
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:33.720]   put ourselves right and we can put our world right. But the gospel starts by telling us
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:45.120]   you can't. You are as helpless in the twentieth century as men have always been. You cannot
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:53.320]   rehabilitate yourself in a moral and in a spiritual sense. You are completely helpless.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:59.920]   This is the cause of the trouble. And then, you see, it ends up by putting it like this,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:09.640]   that we are all so lost and so helpless and so hopeless that God had to send his only
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:19.080]   son into the world in order to save us. Prophets couldn't save us. All the great examples
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:28.920]   all fail. God has to send his own son. The world is so rotten that no man can save himself
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:35.040]   or save anybody else. And God has had to send his only son out of heaven into the world
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:40.160]   in order to save it. Jesus Christ, son of God, the world hates him. He said so. It'll
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:44.760]   hate you as it hated me. Why does it hate him? Because of what he says. What's he doing
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:49.680]   in this world? Don't you realize the very presence of the Son of God in this world is
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:56.280]   a condemnation of the whole of mankind? It is a proclamation that man cannot save himself.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:06.760]   God must save and God alone. And he sends his son. And when it goes on to tell us that
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:15.920]   he even has to die before we can be saved and delivered, it becomes still more objectionable
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:22.440]   and offensive to us, the offense of the cross. The preaching of the cross is to them that
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:30.520]   perish foolishness. It is to the Jews a stumbling block and foolishness to the Greek. Christ
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:36.000]   crucified. This is the cause of mankind's hatred. It was the cause of the hatred of
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.880]   the Sanhedrin. It is still the cause of hatred. Let me sum it up by putting it like this.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:49.760]   This is the gospel, I say, that tells us that we are so helpless and so sinful and so vile
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:56.320]   that it takes the Son of God to save us and to die for us on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:07.640]   And more, that nothing but our being born again and having a new nature placed within
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:14.360]   us can possibly save us. Now, here is the thing I say that arouses the antagonism. If
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:19.640]   Jesus Christ were only a man, nobody would hate him. If he were only a great teacher,
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.880]   nobody would object to him. If only he was a moral exemplar, it would be all right. But
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:29.840]   he isn't, you see. He is Son of God. What does the Son of God do? Why does he come?
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.200]   Why is he necessary? Why does he die? Here is the cause of the trouble. And he preaches
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.920]   this regeneration. He says you can't be improved. You have got to be made again. You
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.680]   have got to be born again. You have got to be generated from the very foundations. You
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:51.400]   need a new nature and a new start. Now this, we say, is insulting. This is infuriating.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:56.200]   We can't listen to this. Away with these people, whether it be he himself or his followers.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:03.160]   Put them to death. Get rid of them. The thing must be stopped. Now, my friends, that is
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:10.640]   the reason why mankind rejects this gospel. That's why the Sanhedrin rejected it. That
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:15.760]   is why men and women are still rejecting it. There is nothing new in the situation. I ask
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:22.640]   you again to take it in terms of calm and quiet reason. Why do you object to this gospel?
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:28.080]   Why do you reject it? What's wrong with it? What's the difficulty? Isn't it what I've
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:34.200]   been suggesting? Don't you feel that a gospel that could save a man in the first century
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:39.280]   is an insult to you in the twentieth? Don't you feel it's insulting to be told that you're
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:44.040]   rotten in your inner nature, that you're so rotten that nothing can save you but a new
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.440]   nature? Don't you see that it's insulting to say that you're so helpless in the grip
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:54.720]   of sin and evil that it takes the Son of God to come from heaven and to die on the cross
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:02.440]   and rise again in order to deliver you? Isn't it that? It touches our pride. And this is
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:09.960]   always the cause of this passionate feeling, this insensitive antagonism, this rejection
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:18.520]   of the gospel in this militant manner. Now here is the analysis of unbelief as we find
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:28.920]   it in this paragraph. Let me come to the last point that is so evident here. Unbelief is
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:39.880]   always against God. The members of the Sanhedrin were not really against these men. They were
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:46.760]   against God. Gamaliel, you see, in a sense, begins to feel this, and that is why he puts
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:52.600]   this point to them. He says, "Refrain from these men and let them alone, for if this
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.920]   counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught; but if it be of God, you cannot
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:08.600]   overthrow it, lest happily you may be found even to fight against God." And this is the
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:20.880]   most appalling and terrible aspect of unbelief. It is based upon a hatred of God. Now there
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:28.760]   are many statements to that effect in the New Testament. The natural carnal mind is
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:39.960]   enmity against God. He is not subject to the law of God. Neither indeed can be. What a
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:48.080]   terrible thing. The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:57.160]   are foolishness unto him. Neither can he know, for they are spiritually discerned. My dear
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:03.160]   friends, what a terrible thing unbelief is. You see, the modern man thinks that he is
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:07.480]   an unbeliever because of his great brain or his great knowledge. It is not that, you see.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:14.520]   It is his hatred of God. And that is why the world is as it is tonight, as I pointed out
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:23.640]   at the very beginning. It is men in rebellion against God. This is the condemnation that
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:35.360]   light has come into the world in Christ. But men love darkness rather than light because
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:43.720]   their deeds were evil. This is the depth of unbelief. This is the most terrible thing
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:54.760]   of all. The world rejected the Son of God because it hates God. It is not only rebelled
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:51:03.560]   against him, it is filled with a spirit of malice and of hatred and of antagonism to
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:12.080]   him, the holy God. Why do men hate the Ten Commandments? Why do they make fun of what
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:18.280]   they call the narrowness of the gospel? A narrowness, I say, that makes a man to keep
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:25.040]   his marriage vows, that keeps him clean and pure, that keeps him from theft and robbery
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:33.080]   and violence and malice and hatred and spite. They hate that. What a terrible condition
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:42.320]   to be in. It is a hatred of God. It is an antagonism to God. But you see, the terrible
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:49.040]   thing, as Gamaliel points out, is this, that it leads men to fight God. Here are these
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.760]   members of the Sanhedrin. "Be careful what you're doing," says Gamaliel. "Be careful
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.760]   lest you may find yourselves fighting against God. If this is of God, you can't stop it."
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:06.200]   But they're trying to stop it. And that is precisely what mankind in its folly has
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:13.960]   been trying to do throughout the running centuries. It has been fighting against God. To reject
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:18.680]   this gospel is not to fight me, it's not to fight the Christian Church. It is ultimately
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:24.560]   to fight God, for it is God who has raised up his only child, Jesus. It is God who sent
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.960]   his Son into the world. In rejecting this, you're not rejecting men, you're rejecting
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:43.320]   God. And there we see the final folly of unbelief. Can't you see the blindness of this Sanhedrin
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:52.120]   and its members? Why don't they face the facts? Look at these men. These men who are
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:53:00.800]   called the apostles. Are they themselves able to speak like this? Have they got a power
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:09.040]   that can heal the helpless, lame men? Why don't they face the facts? Is this men, or
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:13.120]   is it more? Why don't they look at it? Why don't they examine it? They've got great brains,
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.680]   why don't they apply them? Why don't they say to themselves, "We know these men are
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:22.720]   ignorant and unlearned." But how then are they able to act like this? What is this?
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:27.640]   But you see, they were so filled with passion and rage that they didn't ask such intelligent
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:35.360]   questions. But these are the questions. These men were confronted by evidence. What is the
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:40.920]   explanation of these men? There's only one. It is what they say themselves, that it is
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:46.680]   this Jesus, whom the Sanhedrin had slain, who had risen, ascended into heaven. He's
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:51.720]   still acting. He sent the Spirit. He's sending power. It's his power through them.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:54:00.760]   If only they'd reasoned like that, they would very soon have seen that they are not fighting
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:09.440]   men, but fighting and resisting God. If this were only of men, it would have ceased to be,
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:14.840]   as Gamaliel argues so rightly, long ago. But it hasn't ceased. It's still going on.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:20.520]   This is still the power of God unto salvation. You can't explain the history of the Christian
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.720]   Church throughout the centuries except in these terms. Look at its record. Look what
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.560]   it's done. Can you explain it in terms of men? You cannot. There's only one explanation.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:38.640]   It is God. So in rejecting the gospel, you're not merely rejecting a preacher,
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:47.200]   you're not merely rejecting the Church, you are fighting against God, the God who can
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:53.920]   heal a man born lame and give him perfect soundness, a God who can conquer death and
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:59.880]   the grave. You men can kill the Son of God, but God raised him from the dead. That's what
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:12.920]   you're up against, the almighty power of God. My dear friends, isn't that the true analysis
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:19.480]   of the members of the Sanhedrin? When they heard that, they were cut to the heart and
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:27.280]   took counsel to slay them. Oh, the madness, oh, the folly. They're fighting God. They're
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.880]   trying to put an end to his gospel. They're trying to silence his witnesses. They're saying,
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:37.520]   "No more of this. We are going to stop it." But they're raising themselves against the
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:49.240]   one who raised his Son from the grave. They are fighting the eternal power of God. They
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:59.440]   are fighting the Lord of the universe and the judge of the universe. This is sheer madness,
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:09.600]   sheer irrationality. This is the blindness of sin. This is men blinded by the God of
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:20.440]   this world to the glories of the God of heaven. Very well, as I say, I've put this before
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:27.320]   you not merely that we might entertain ourselves in looking back at an old incident, an old
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:38.120]   story of the first century. We are still in the same world. We've still got the same problems.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:52.400]   We are still facing the same God. And there is still only one way of salvation. It is
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:58.080]   in Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:08.600]   My dear friend, learn the lesson from the members of the Sanhedrin. See the real nature
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:22.200]   of unbelief and turn from it and cry out to God for mercy and for compassion. And you
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:31.720]   will find that you will receive it. Admit your failure. Admit your sin. Admit your blindness.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:38.240]   Admit your unbelief. Admit your utter helplessness. Go to him just as you are saying, "Nothing
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:45.400]   in my hands I bring. Simply to thy cross I cling. Naked come to thee for dress. Helpless
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:56.120]   look to thee for grace. Foul I to the fountain fly. Wash me, Savior, or I die." You say
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:04.240]   that to him and he'll give you an abundant assurance that your sins are forgiven, that
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:13.480]   you are reconciled to God, that you have a new nature, and that there lies awaiting you
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:17.280]   the glory of heaven and everlasting bliss.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:25.440]   Oh, beloved friend, if hitherto you have been held in the bondage of unbelief, see it, flee
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:36.160]   from it, cry out unto him. For it is still by his infinite grace the day of salvation.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.680]   Amen.
