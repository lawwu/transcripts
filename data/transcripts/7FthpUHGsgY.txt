[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   Today we have a preaching question for you, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.080]   As you have worked through entire books of the Bible as an expositor, how did you think
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.660]   about the prominence of Christian hedonism in your sermons?
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.340]   Did you think of every sermon as an opportunity to make a beeline to joy at some point, as
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.640]   Spurgeon said of the cross?
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.640]   Did you try to make connections to joy thematically, like perhaps in texts that dealt with the
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.320]   nature of personal faith or that spoke of God's glory, even where joy was not explicitly
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.320]   mentioned in your primary text?
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.400]   Or did you just wait until texts explicitly used the joy language to let those sermons
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.680]   become your opportunity to talk Christian hedonism?
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.160]   How did you approach this?
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.160]   That's complicated.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.760]   Yes, it is.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.040]   There are two ways to answer this question.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:05.880]   One is to do a statistical analysis of what I really said in 35 years of messages, and
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.320]   that would be the most reliable way to answer it.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.760]   And of course, it's all there, available for anybody who wants to do that, though I can
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.040]   think of more profitable things to do with your time.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:26.880]   The other way is to ask me what my intentions were, what were my homiletical strategies
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.180]   or hermeneutical convictions that governed the way I handled texts, and that's what's
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.860]   being asked, I think.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.900]   And it's not a very reliable way to know, because my memory of how I approached thousands
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.480]   of texts is not very good.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.400]   But I will do my best to say what I think today, and others can judge whether 30 years
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.520]   ago you actually practiced this.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:08.060]   When a preacher comes to a text, he never deals with it in isolation from what he knows
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.080]   from that author in other texts or other biblical authors on that same theme.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:26.200]   Texts have deeper and wider meaning and significance the more clearly you see how what it teaches
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.120]   relates to the rest of what Scripture teaches.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:40.480]   For example, Jesus says in Mark 10 that he did not come to be served, but to serve.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:51.880]   Now, knowing Acts 17.25 at this very point may have a profound impact on how a preacher
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.920]   deals with Mark 10.45 and vice versa.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:07.320]   Acts 17.25 says God is not served by human hands as though he needed anything, but he
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.880]   gives to all life and breath and everything.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:21.160]   In other words, Christ coming not to be served is an expression of a wider, larger, deeper,
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.000]   divine trait that God is of such a nature he cannot be served by man.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.800]   And taken together, these two texts unleash a river of thoughts about the nature of God
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.560]   and Christ and salvation and discipleship.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.320]   And my point is that to know those things is going to affect the way you preach on either
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.200]   of those texts.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.680]   So the point is that the more connections you know from the Bible, the richer and deeper
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.040]   you will go with each text.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:07.400]   The trick is to let each text make its real contribution to the whole rather than letting
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.000]   the whole squash the text into what you already know from other texts.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   That's the trick.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.140]   That's the catch.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:24.680]   One must be utterly honest with every text, and over time the spiritually discerning people
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.760]   in our churches will see whether we are honest with every text or whether we're squashing
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.720]   them all into our little systematic desire, whether it's Christian hedonism or whatever
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.360]   you happen to love.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.600]   So here's how it works with me and Christian hedonism, namely, God is most glorified in
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   you when you are most satisfied in him.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.200]   And I'll put it in three or four principles.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.880]   I know that the greatest commandment in the Bible is that we love God with all of our
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:09.920]   And I know that because Jesus said it's the greatest and because numerous texts on loving
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.360]   God teach it.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:21.760]   And I also have learned from the Bible that that means, loving God means, treasuring God
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.280]   above all things, finding him to be our all-satisfying treasure.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.320]   Now, that's a piece of Christian hedonism.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.600]   In other words, I don't just use the word, "The main commandment in the Bible is to love
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   God."
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   I want to know, what do you mean, love God?
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.640]   What does it mean to love God?
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.960]   Does it mean work for him because he's a needy God, or does it mean find him all-satisfying
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.920]   supreme treasure?
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.760]   And I conclude the latter, which means that this goal, bringing people to obey the greatest
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.080]   commandment every Sunday, because it's the greatest commandment, you want people to do
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.200]   it and you want them to be pointed toward that greatest commandment in everything you
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:11.560]   say, that will inevitably cause me to lean toward displaying God as all-satisfying, displaying
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.640]   God as the greatest treasure in the world, under, in, behind every text.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.880]   If it's explicit, I hope I can make that plain.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.460]   If it's not explicit, I hope the sermon will have that flavor, and the people will have
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:34.040]   to judge whether I'm succeeding in imposing or inferring.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   Here's the second one.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.320]   "I know from 1 Corinthians 10:31 that God aims for us to glorify him in everything,
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.520]   everything, from the moment this sermon is over till people show up again, everything
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.560]   they do is to be done for the glory of God.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.160]   And I know from years of reading the Bible and study that this is God's supreme passion,
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.320]   not just mine or Paul's.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:06.040]   I have also learned that God is not so much glorified in people and their attitudes if
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:12.040]   they are not satisfied in him, if they don't find pleasure in him, if he's not their supreme
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.520]   treasure.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:23.080]   So very close, beneath or behind every sermon is the aim to help people delight in God all
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:31.320]   the time, including horrible times, because glorifying God is supremely important in the
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.880]   Bible, and that's the way we do it."
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.880]   Here's third.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:44.320]   "I have learned that the gospel of Christ's death and resurrection is both the supreme
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:51.400]   demonstration of the gift of God's glory"—it's the gospel of the glory of God in the face
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.680]   of Christ—"and the death of Christ is the price paid so that we could have that
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.840]   glory, see that glory, receive that gift.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:10.680]   And therefore, I have tried in recent decades especially to keep the cross close, beneath,
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:16.760]   behind all preaching because the cross is the price that was paid for God's glory
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.440]   and the ultimate presentation of God's glory for our everlasting enjoyment."
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.400]   And here's the fourth and last thing.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.600]   "I am deathly afraid of imposing alien meanings on texts."
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:41.560]   I think imposing alien meanings from outside of text, even other texts, you know, God's
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:49.640]   word, imposing alien meanings on text is the death knell of authority in preaching.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.680]   I think it's the death knell of trustworthiness as a preacher.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.720]   I think it's the death knell of being interesting as a preacher year in and year out.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:08.080]   And I think it's the death knell of growing in our understanding of the Bible.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:16.400]   So my aim in preaching has always been, "Show the people what's in the text, what is really
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   there.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.600]   I want them to see what's really there.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:28.440]   And if there's more than meets the eye regarding the glory of God, loving God, cross of Christ,
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:37.520]   Christian hedonism, if there's more than meets the eye, then it better be really visible
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.520]   to people when you're done."
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.360]   It needs to grow out of the text organically rather than being imposed on it.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:54.880]   If the people don't see the bigger points organically growing out of the text, they
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.760]   will start to feel, "This guy can't really be trusted with the Bible."
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.260]   And they'll start to be bored because they can expect what's coming every week.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:11.640]   So that's my goal and whether I succeeded, others will have to judge.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.640]   Very good.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.640]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.680]   And it reminds me of a question I asked a while back, "How do you prepare your sermons?"
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.200]   That was episode number 229 in the podcast archive for those leaders out there who are
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.980]   interested in learning about how you write sermons, Pastor John.
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.160]   And speaking of the archive, you can search all of our over 500 episodes to date.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.600]   We have free apps for Apple and Android devices for this, of course.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.640]   And now we have a landing page on our website as well.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   Go to DesiringGod.org at the top of the page and click "More" and then click on "Ask
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.640]   Pastor John."
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.600]   And you can search there by the title and episode number.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.880]   Tomorrow we return and John Piper will explain how you can make a difference in this world
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.320]   or how not to waste your life.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.320]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.640]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
