[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.640]   This week we are joined by pastor and author Tim Keller,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.240]   who is soon to release a new book titled
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.680]   Prayer, Experiencing Awe and Intimacy with God.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.520]   And Tim joins us again to talk about prayer.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.820]   On to question number seven of 10 this week.
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.420]   We have passages like Luke 11 verses 11 to 13
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.560]   that seem to say a fruitful prayer life
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.360]   requires a foundational conviction
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.960]   that God is my father and he is totally for me
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.760]   without hesitation on his part.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.000]   He is holy and completely for my good.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.720]   Just how key is this conviction for a healthy prayer life?
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.260]   - Well, it has to be foundational
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.120]   or Jesus wouldn't have started the Lord's prayer
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.040]   with the words our father.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.080]   Also, from what we can tell,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.400]   I don't know that Jesus ever addressed God.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.640]   Some Bible scholar may find me an exception
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.600]   to what I'm about to say here,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.400]   but I don't think Jesus ever addressed God
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.760]   without calling him father.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.800]   And so it must be foundational.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.320]   And I would say it's foundational
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.740]   because in the word father, that you are my father,
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.200]   you essentially have the gospel in miniature
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.480]   because if God is my boss, if he's my employer,
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.200]   then even though he might be a very good boss
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.360]   or very good employer, nevertheless,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.640]   in the end, he's not unconditionally committed to me.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.500]   If I act up, eventually, he may give me a break or two,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.880]   but eventually my boss will say,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.820]   "I'm sorry, you're terminated."
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.160]   And so if I forget that God is my father,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.480]   I may come to him in prayer, basically in a mercenary way,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.760]   basically saying, "I'm gonna do this and this and this,
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.720]   "and now you owe me this and this and this."
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.200]   And that makes prayer into,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.400]   first of all, that destroys the ability to adore God.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.420]   You're basically in a petition.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.120]   Secondly, it makes prayer a way of manipulating God.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.180]   But if you say God is my father,
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.720]   I have three sons and I know growing up
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.800]   that they were always in different places,
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.760]   but if one of them was acting up,
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.040]   if one of them was actually being a little more disobedient,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.040]   a little more rebellious or something like that,
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.120]   as a father, if anything, my heart went out to him more.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.600]   It actually got more involved with him
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.680]   because I'm not his boss, I'm his father.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.860]   And so when I know that, when I call God father,
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.500]   I know I'm coming in Jesus' name,
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.960]   I'm coming only because of God's grace,
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.540]   I know because of Jesus died for me,
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.060]   now God is committed to me.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.100]   Now, by the way, to say that God is my father,
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.580]   therefore I can always know that he will hear me
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.140]   and I can rest and I can adore him,
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.420]   that doesn't mean, by the way, that I can sin away.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.500]   And the reason is, of course,
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.120]   that if you break your boss's rules,
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.940]   that doesn't hurt your boss as much
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.380]   as if you break your father's rules
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.340]   because that's really trampling on your father's heart.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.460]   So I would say calling God father means,
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.860]   on the one hand, I'm assured of grace,
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.880]   on the one hand, I'm sure he's always gonna hear me,
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.800]   so that makes my petition stronger,
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.340]   but on the other hand, it also means
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.580]   that I have to confess my sins
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.420]   because this wonderful God who's done all this for me
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.140]   and has brought me into his family
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.300]   at the infinite cost of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.900]   that I need to obey him because of his good grace.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.040]   So to call God father enhances everything you do in prayer
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.920]   and if you don't know that God is your father,
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.360]   it basically flattens and reduces and thins out
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.020]   every other kind of prayer.
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.860]   - So true.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.880]   All right, moving on to question number eight
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.880]   and this is perhaps the thing that I was least expecting
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.000]   to learn from your book
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.680]   and the most surprising thing to see in it,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.460]   but it makes total sense to me now.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.080]   You say that prayer gives us
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.440]   an accurate knowledge of ourselves.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.280]   Explain this.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.200]   How does prayer lead to self-knowledge?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.320]   - C.S. Lewis gives an image that says
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.660]   that if you're a proud person,
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.260]   you'll never be able to see God
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.260]   because a proud person is always looking down on everyone,
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.700]   cannot see something that's above him, bigger than him
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.260]   and from that illustration, that image,
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.200]   I get that it's in God's presence that I learn humility.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.580]   I learn, I really do not know how sinful I am
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.900]   unless I'm in the presence of a holy God.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.340]   That's what happened to Isaiah.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.980]   You know, the first thing that happens when Isaiah
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.940]   is in the presence of holy, holy, holy God in Isaiah six,
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.100]   what's the first thing he says?
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.860]   He does not say, oh, you're so holy.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.980]   He says, you know, I'm a man of unclean lips.
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.040]   See, right away, he senses his sin.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.660]   Just like the brighter a light is,
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.260]   the more you can see the dirt on your hands.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.020]   The more beautiful, you know, a person is,
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.620]   the more us unbeautiful people see
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.380]   that we're not very good looking.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.940]   I mean, in other words, when you get close
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.660]   to superlativeness, then you see your flaws.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.220]   And so there's absolutely no way
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.940]   that you will really existentially know
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.500]   that you're a sinner and what's wrong with you
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.680]   unless you draw near to a holy God in prayer.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.180]   - So is this why we don't pray
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.340]   and we just don't wanna see the dirt on us?
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.300]   - Yes, I actually do, prayer is very humbling.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.080]   I mean, I find it very hard, for example,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.740]   if I'm really upset, it's hard for me to stay upset
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.660]   when I get in God's presence because I say,
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.540]   look, Lord, you know, you're wise
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.020]   and I really don't need to be this upset.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.200]   You know what you're doing.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.300]   Or if I'm, in other words, it's very hard to stay
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.880]   in a kind of high horse, self-righteous spot
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.140]   and then turn around and pray.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.540]   It just knocks you off your horse right away.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.940]   That's right.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.940]   - So true.
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.380]   This was an unexpected lesson,
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.980]   but a valuable one from your book.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.020]   Thank you, Dr. Keller.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.620]   And tomorrow's Friday, we finish out this little series
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.080]   of episodes on prayer.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.820]   So what types of prayers don't work?
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.380]   I'll ask Dr. Keller that tomorrow.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.260]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.760]   Thanks for listening to the Aspester John Podcast.
