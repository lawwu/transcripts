[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.300]   - Welcome to episode number three
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.040]   of the Bogleheads Life Stages Podcast.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.600]   Bogleheads are investors who follow
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.580]   John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.040]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.040]   Today's episode features Michelle Dash
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.680]   and Steven Chen from New Retirement.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.580]   This recording was made on April 7th, 2021.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.020]   This recording is for educational purposes only
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.940]   and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:46.820]   - So tonight we're gonna go through
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.820]   a demo of New Retirement.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.340]   And let's see, I have Steven Chen with me,
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.900]   the founder of New Retirement.
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.660]   Give it away, Steve.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.660]   And he's just giving us a little introduction
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.000]   of how New Retirement started
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.540]   and a little bit about the tool and where we're going.
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.380]   And then he'll turn things over to me
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.980]   and I have a couple of screens up on my end
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.740]   and I will walk you through a live version of the demo.
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.380]   - Okay, awesome.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.980]   Hey, everyone, appreciate your time and attention.
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.260]   I'll try to keep this really short
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.180]   'cause I know we're here to talk about the product
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.980]   and we welcome all feedback.
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.460]   So yeah, I'm the founder.
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.340]   Basically, this got started because I was trying
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.820]   to help my mom with her own retirement situation.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.780]   She came to my brother and I when she was in her early 60s
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.500]   and needed to borrow some money.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.180]   And we looked around to try and get her advice
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.500]   and help from a financial advisor,
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.540]   but couldn't really find anyone
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.580]   that focused on decumulation
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.260]   or was interested in her situation
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.040]   'cause her net worth was maybe $250,000,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.460]   including her home, which was more than half of it.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.540]   So we ended up doing it ourselves on spreadsheets
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.620]   and then a lot of it was expense management
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.980]   and looking at her whole life holistically.
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.620]   So healthcare, social security,
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.940]   we ended up helping her downsize
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.260]   and freeing up a lot of home equity
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.220]   and then helping her think through investing that
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.980]   and should she annuitize and stuff, questions like that.
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.260]   So we felt like, hey,
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.420]   there's probably a really big need here
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940]   given the size of the populations,
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.360]   120 million people over age 50 in this country.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.860]   And so we kind of set about building in
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.660]   and it started out as a kind of a side project
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.460]   and then now has become kind of a full blown big effort.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.180]   I mean, we have 22 people,
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.140]   so we're still relatively small company,
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.680]   but solely focused on building this platform
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.620]   and helping people think through decumulation
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.820]   and give them a central free or low cost way
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.300]   to manage themselves.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.100]   So that's kind of how it got started.
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.220]   Really the way we think about this
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.340]   is we're building a platform.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.580]   So it's not just a tool,
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.580]   but it's really a way to enable an ecosystem.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.220]   So we have the tool,
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.460]   we also have a community around it,
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.900]   we have a bunch of educational content around it.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.580]   In the future, we do wanna enable people
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.140]   to be able to find curated experts that can help them,
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.140]   but in a completely transparent way.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.180]   So we are paid by our customers and no one else.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.420]   So people can pay us through subscribing
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.020]   or they can hire us to coach them up
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.020]   or we provide a CFP advice,
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.100]   but on a flat fee basis,
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.980]   like a coaching session is like 150 bucks an hour
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.540]   or 45 minutes.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.540]   We'll do a flat fee plan review for a thousand bucks.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.380]   That's it.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.840]   There's no AUM or anything else wrapped up in this.
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.220]   But because it's software,
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.860]   it enables us to go through partners
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.620]   at a very low cost in a very low cost way.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.620]   So we're talking to employers and media companies
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.260]   and there's some stuff coming down the pipe that way.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.980]   A little bit about where we're going.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.180]   So today it's really like,
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.740]   you can think of it as like a TurboTax for planning.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.500]   So it's like, you just do it all yourself.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.060]   You pull the knobs and levers
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.420]   and you can see what's coming
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.660]   and how your plan might change.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.220]   And then where we're going is,
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.660]   we're looking at the data at an aggregate level
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.900]   and like what's working to achieve better outcomes
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.340]   for our partners or sorry, for our users.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.580]   And then we're surfacing things
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.940]   that are relevant for them.
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.960]   So for example,
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.520]   we're about to roll out social security optimization
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.900]   that will run 12,000 simulations for an end user
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.780]   to say, hey, we looked at your plan,
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.260]   all of your income, expenses, taxes,
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.020]   future withdrawals, conversions, Roth conversions,
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.860]   stuff like that.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.280]   And here's how you might be able to get more money
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.400]   from social security.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.020]   So we can do that.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.180]   Users can initiate that.
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.740]   What we can also do is run it automatically
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.400]   behind the scenes for 145,000 people on surface.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.940]   Like, hey, it looks like there's an opportunity for you,
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.340]   Michelle, to do this and point it out for them proactively.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.020]   So we are going to automate Roth conversions,
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.260]   which you'll see demonstrated in here,
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.340]   but we can do that.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.700]   Social security optimizations.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.020]   I mean, essentially anything around planning,
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.840]   we'll be able to proactively do for you in advance
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.200]   and at least won't do it, but like surface, like,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.600]   hey, there might be an opportunity here
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.440]   that you haven't thought about.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.880]   So that's like a little bit about how we think
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.600]   a little bit differently about this.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.580]   And we are sucking in lots of data behind the scenes
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.120]   if people decide to opt in for that,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.680]   if you decide to link accounts.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.160]   And yeah, if you want to go back one slide just real quick,
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.000]   and then I'll be quiet.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.880]   Basically, completely independent platform,
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.180]   consumer focused, you know,
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.900]   we have this platform technology first approach.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.300]   And that's, I think, you know,
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.180]   kind of what differentiates us from other companies.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.420]   Anyway, sorry if this was too salesy,
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.660]   but I just want to give you the quick overview.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.160]   I'll turn it back to Michelle.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.160]   - Okay, so there's a few more slides.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.700]   I just want to walk you through kind of the key stats
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.300]   of like what we do.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.740]   As Steve mentioned, you know,
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.900]   the way we get paid is by consumers,
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.120]   and that really helps us stay unbiased.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.640]   We have different levels of the program.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.220]   There's a free version, it's always free.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.880]   You know, it's really meant for people
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.440]   who want to see if they're on track.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.640]   It has limited functionality in terms of assumptions
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.400]   and some of the more advanced tools and charting
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.320]   that Steve was mentioning.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.600]   The Planner Plus option is about 100 bucks a month,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.880]   a little bit less.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.080]   And this is going to unlock all of the charts that we have,
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.300]   all the projections, lots of suggestions,
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.300]   and everything that you see in the demo today.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.260]   And then on top of that, we have Planner Plus Live,
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.540]   which is, you know, the Planner Plus service,
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.060]   as well as a couple of coaching sessions.
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.940]   And then we have the option for advisors.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.700]   So we're really trying to, you know,
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.940]   provide something for everyone at every stage
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.740]   of their financial planning journey.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.300]   When you come in the tool and we'll look at all this live,
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.060]   the first thing you do is you work on your plan.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.040]   So you want to go in, you want to make sure that,
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.720]   you know, check the dashboard, see how you're doing,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.800]   and then go back, refine your plan, add more detail,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.260]   make it as accurate as possible.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.720]   And then you can use our coach suggestions,
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.580]   which is like an automated rule engine
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.940]   to help figure out what's going on with your plan,
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.880]   where are there areas where you can improve,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   where there are areas that you can learn about strategies
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.440]   that you didn't know about.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.040]   And if you have some inaccuracies in your plan
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.200]   or assumptions that are different than averages
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.920]   or historical averages,
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.820]   then we're just going to let you know.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:51.000]   After you create a plan, then, you know,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.580]   there's a lot of different places
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.920]   where you can find optimizations.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.160]   So we just actually are, we launched today
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.520]   the Insights Library, which is just an overview
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.380]   of all the different charts that we have.
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.880]   So this is like the debut of that.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.420]   And then Steve mentioned, we have a Roth Explorer,
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.020]   which kind of helps you figure out
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:18.260]   the optimal estate value,
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.940]   the optimal savings for your estate
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.300]   by doing Roth conversions earlier in your plan.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:30.020]   We also have, like, what we really want to do
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.340]   is we want you to stress test your plan, right?
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.780]   So we're giving you a platform to create a plan,
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.020]   but we don't want you to just create one plan.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.340]   We want you to create a plan
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.360]   and then experiment with what-if scenarios
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.280]   and think about all the different things
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.300]   that can happen along the way.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.340]   'Cause it's, you know, it's impossible to plan
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.100]   for, you know, a year from now,
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.820]   let alone 20 or 30 years from now.
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.700]   But what we can do is think through potential outcomes
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.220]   and have rough ideas of what we would do
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.860]   in different situations and really plan for them
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.740]   in a time where we're not stressed out
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.820]   or need to make any split-second decisions.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:12.940]   Another thing I wanted to bring to everyone's attention
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.340]   is that we have a lot of free communities,
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.460]   free webinars, and free education.
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.180]   So I lead most of the demos.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.340]   I lead office hours.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.260]   If you have questions about the tool,
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.860]   you have a webinar every couple of weeks.
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.380]   I answer questions live.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.260]   I go through different demos.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.700]   We also sponsor Must Be Anything events
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.060]   with hot leaders from like all different parts
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.740]   of the financial industry.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.860]   So all of that is free because, you know,
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.540]   our goal is to really get people educated
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.260]   and learning about different opportunities
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.300]   and strategies that can help them with financial wellness.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.900]   We also have a Facebook group.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.100]   We have almost 4,000 people in it right now.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.700]   It's extremely dynamic.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.980]   A lot of you are already members.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.900]   We have a lot of great conversation
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.980]   about withdrawal strategies, news articles,
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.180]   how to use the tool, what assumptions people use.
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.900]   So it's a great place to collaborate
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.060]   and be able to plan with others
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.940]   and learn from others' experience
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.620]   because, you know, retirement is something
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.060]   that most of us only do one time.
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.940]   And then finally, we've mentioned a couple of times
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.900]   that we have additional services.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.020]   So you can certainly schedule live appointments
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.140]   to review your plan for accuracy
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.260]   or for just help understanding some of the charts.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.300]   I run most of those sessions.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.020]   And then we also have a CFP in-house
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.340]   who will help you with your plan.
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.620]   And we really try to keep this low cost
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.500]   and we're able to do that
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.260]   because we're really leveraging our technology platform
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.100]   to do that.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.260]   So any questions before I get started with the demo?
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.420]   Okay, so the first thing I wanna take everyone through
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.300]   is the onboarding process.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.260]   Here, you're gonna start the plan.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.420]   You have an option to go through a quick version
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.220]   or a comprehensive version.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.020]   Tonight, I'm gonna go through the quick version
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.660]   just to give you a sense of the types of questions
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.700]   that are in the onboarding process.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.060]   So we're gonna ask you a little bit about yourself,
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.780]   if you're married and have a spouse.
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.660]   We're gonna ask you generally about your household income,
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.620]   what you think your social security estimates are,
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.940]   how much you have in savings, at a very high level
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.700]   because once you go into the plan,
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.740]   you'll have an opportunity to refine it
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.460]   and add more assumptions.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.340]   We're gonna ask if you have a pension,
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.180]   if you own your home or if you have a house.
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.100]   And then we ask also about medical expenses
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.460]   and your other monthly expenses
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.500]   or the things that you're paying for
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.020]   on a monthly or an annual basis.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.660]   Once you finish up, you're gonna go to a dashboard
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.820]   and I'm actually gonna switch to my demo account here
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.060]   and you're gonna land on the dashboard page.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.900]   When you're here, the first thing you might notice
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.140]   is your scorecard.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.940]   So we're gonna give you a score.
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.300]   This represents the ratio of income to expenses.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.540]   And it's just kind of one indicator
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.180]   that's letting you know, how are you doing?
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.340]   Are you on track to have enough income
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.420]   to cover your expenses?
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.020]   We're also giving you the current net worth
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.260]   based on the information that you entered into your plan,
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.980]   your average monthly retirement income,
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.660]   your end estate value.
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.180]   So how much you're projected to have at longevity age
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.820]   and if your savings are gonna run out.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.500]   Okay, I recommend that you come back to these key indicators
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.700]   as you're making updates to your plan
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.900]   because they kind of benchmark where you start
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.260]   versus where you end up after you spend some time
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.900]   revising your plan, adding detail or doing what if scenarios.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.260]   This main chart on the dashboard
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.700]   is called the lifetime retirement projections chart.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.020]   Hey, I like to call it the story of retirement
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.340]   because what it's doing is it's showing us
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.660]   how our income is gonna cover expenses over time.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.180]   So we start today here in 2021
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.060]   and we're looking out at our income.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.500]   So all the columns represent income.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.980]   We have different ways of sources of income,
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.780]   whether it's work, Social Security, annuities, pensions.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.100]   And then we also count income as income
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.420]   that we're pulling out of our savings accounts.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.780]   So 401ks, overtaking withdrawals in the future,
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.980]   we're considering that part of your income for retirement.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.700]   The blue line that goes through this chart
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.500]   that represents expenses.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.420]   So anytime you see the columns above the blue line,
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.940]   that means you have more income coming in
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.620]   than expenses in a given year.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.380]   Also on this page, we're showing you
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.500]   your whole plan highlights,
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.180]   but what I really wanna do is show you
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.340]   all of the different areas of my plan that we can customize.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.980]   So when I look at my plan,
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.660]   we kind of break it up into a lot of categories,
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.300]   the goals, income, Social Security,
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.580]   annuities and pensions, savings and assets, withdrawals.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.580]   We're gonna just fly through some of these sections.
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.260]   On basic programs, we're gonna go through
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.980]   all of the different sections.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.940]   On basic profile and goals,
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.620]   you're asking for your single or married filing status
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.220]   for your tax structure in the plan.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.420]   We're also asking you for your longevity age
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.660]   of you and your spouse, if you have one.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.660]   So we know how long we want your plan to be funded.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.820]   The next thing I wanna show you is work and other income.
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.060]   This is where we're gonna enter
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.540]   any kind of earned income that you have.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.820]   The nice thing about this section is it's really flexible.
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.060]   Not only do you put in what your current income is,
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.660]   you can model that in the future.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.580]   So I'm gonna be earning income from now through age 60.
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.500]   If you're someone who is thinking about modeling
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.460]   a sabbatical or retiring early,
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.260]   or maybe one spouse wants to stay home with kids,
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.980]   you're easily able to model different ranges of work times,
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.340]   which can be really powerful
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.460]   when you're thinking through your scenario
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.820]   for your long-term projections.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.820]   I also wanna call attention over here to your updates.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.020]   So all of these charts are gonna update in real time.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.380]   You have the option to look at a chart
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.460]   to see if your savings will run out,
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.420]   your savings balances over time,
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.540]   that same income versus expenses chart.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.620]   You can look at your score or your taxes.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.140]   So it's really helpful to toggle
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.660]   through these different charts,
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.860]   depending on what screen you're on
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.540]   and what supporting information that you have.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.300]   So for example, all this updates in real time.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.300]   So if I change my monthly income to $20,000,
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.940]   we're gonna see that my income,
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.580]   projected income went up in real time.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.660]   So it had a big increase.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.460]   Also on this page,
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.700]   you have the ability to model passive income.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.140]   Most people use this to model income from rental property.
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.140]   The next section gets into detail about Social Security.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.620]   So we ask you to enter in your Social Security
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.020]   based on your full retirement age.
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.940]   And that's so we can separately give you the option
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.740]   to choose when you wanna claim Social Security.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.820]   So you have the option to claim early
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.100]   or to delay until when you're 70.
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.020]   As Steve mentioned,
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.780]   we will be coming out with the Social Security Explorer tool
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.300]   to help you dig deeper into some of those lifelong benefits
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.220]   and how you can optimize your planning strategy.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.700]   Social Security is one area
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.860]   where we do allow you to model assumptions separately.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.420]   So you can separately enter the cost of living
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.140]   appreciation for Social Security.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:59.500]   Yeah, I will demo Roth and tax modeling.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.340]   Absolutely.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.780]   The next section is annuities and pensions.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.580]   So you have the ability if you already own an annuity,
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.340]   you know the cashflow, you can put that in here.
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.460]   If you're thinking about purchasing an annuity
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.300]   in the future,
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.660]   whether it's an immediate or deferred annuity,
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.180]   you can put that here and enter in all the information.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.620]   You also can model pensions.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.740]   We have two different types of pensions.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.980]   So we have a monthly pension when you know your cashflow,
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.580]   and we have a lump sum pension
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.740]   when you're expecting to have a monthly pension.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.300]   If you're expecting to receive a lump sum value,
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.220]   we let you select the destination account
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.700]   for where that goes.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.060]   This section can be particularly helpful
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.540]   if you're thinking about how you should take your pension,
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.380]   whether you should take it in a lump sum
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.460]   or whether you should take it over time.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.420]   You can model one scenario that uses the monthly pension,
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.860]   another scenario that uses the lump sum,
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.060]   and then you're able to see
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.460]   how that affects your overall financial picture
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.860]   far into the future.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.180]   (silence)
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:06.820]   The next section is savings and assets.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.460]   So here we have,
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.060]   this is where we might model all of our account information.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.660]   This first topic is about tax deferred accounts,
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.500]   both retirement income and other accounts.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.740]   So here we see that in this example,
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.220]   we have a 401(k),
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.460]   we also have a Roth 401(k) and a Roth IRA.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.620]   The spouse has a 529 plan set up for children,
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.300]   a former 401(k) and HSA plan.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.380]   And then we also have a catch-all for other pre-tax.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.060]   The account type is really interesting
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.060]   because when you make contributions to these accounts
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:42.980]   based on the type,
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.900]   it's gonna assume the tax treatment
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.140]   on the contribution and the withdrawal.
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.980]   So when I make a contribution to a Roth account,
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.740]   it's gonna know that it's taxed on the way in.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.740]   And when I make a withdrawal from the Roth account,
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.780]   it's gonna know not to tax at all.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.940]   Further down on the page,
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.140]   we also ask about other savings.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.340]   So this is cash savings,
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.300]   whether it's in a bank account or a brokerage account.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.940]   When you select capital gains treatment,
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.580]   that means that all the withdrawals
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.940]   coming out of this account
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.820]   are gonna be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.900]   instead of at ordinary income.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.100]   As long as you enter the cost basis,
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.340]   the proportional amount of growth
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.420]   will be taxed at the long-term gains rate.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.060]   So very important to enter in the cost basis.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.940]   We let you model contributing to different accounts.
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.100]   So as you have new income coming in,
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.740]   if you wanna direct it towards different savings goals,
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.340]   whether that's your 401(k) or HSA,
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.180]   you can certainly do that here.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.220]   And then if you're expecting a lump sum
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.340]   or an inheritance, a windfall,
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.500]   we allow you to add after-tax contributions
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.900]   at a certain point in time in the future.
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.100]   Also on this page, you can model
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.380]   if you have cash value for business,
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.940]   you have collectibles or other assets.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.340]   This section in particular,
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.060]   it's included in your net worth,
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.900]   but it's not considered liquid cash flow,
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.620]   so it's not included in most of the calculations
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.300]   when we think about withdrawal strategy
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.620]   and our liquid cash.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.300]   Also on this page, and I'm scrolling back up,
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.900]   is an area for Roth conversions.
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.060]   So I know that's a big topic for everybody in this group.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.660]   When I think about Roth conversions,
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.780]   I really like to look at taxes.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.140]   So I'm gonna toggle to the tax area
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.140]   and click on the federal toggle.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.020]   So here on this chart,
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.420]   we're able to see our projected tax liability
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.700]   broken down by tax bracket
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.060]   between now and the end of our plan.
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.140]   So we can see that in the future,
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.180]   like right now while I'm working,
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.540]   I'm in the 22% tax bracket.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.940]   In the future, because of all the growth
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.900]   and the good savings that I'm doing,
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.620]   I might be in the 24% tax bracket.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.660]   So that means that I could be eligible
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.900]   for Roth conversions as part of my strategy,
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.100]   and you're able to model that here.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.060]   So I can see that I'm gonna be eligible
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.980]   for Roth conversions as part of my strategy.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.300]   So I'm gonna click on that here.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.500]   So I see that I have a tax window.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.900]   I started filling this out,
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.380]   and as I enter in more information
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.860]   for the conversion amount,
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.020]   converting from my 401k into a Roth IRA account,
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.620]   you can see in real time that we're adding tax liability,
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.900]   but we're also reducing our future tax liability.
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.700]   The area in red on that chart
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.140]   is where we're adding tax liability forward.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.540]   So using this chart and this section of the tool together
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.060]   to really experiment with a Roth conversion strategy
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.660]   on a Roth conversion ladder can be really powerful.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.100]   You can also kind of see here
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.820]   that it is telling you on each click of the button
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.620]   whether your lifetime tax liability
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.660]   has increased or decreased,
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.980]   as well as showing you up here your lifetime tax liability.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.340]   All of your tax liability between now
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.700]   and the end of your plan.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:23.100]   While we're on the topic of withdrawals,
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.740]   I'm gonna talk about the withdrawal section next.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.140]   So in the tool, we model
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.420]   several different withdrawal strategies.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.620]   The based on spending needs strategy
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.140]   assumes that you're modeling exactly
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.940]   what you put into the plan.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:44.660]   If your expenses exceed your income,
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.820]   then you're gonna start withdrawing
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.900]   from some of your accounts.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.860]   So the tool actually has an order of operations
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.060]   for how we do this.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.740]   We always take withdrawals from new income.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.660]   Then we take withdrawals from taxable,
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.740]   then tax deferred, then Roth, then HSA.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.260]   So this strategy right here
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.380]   is not necessarily showing you
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.020]   which account it's coming from.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.260]   It's just showing you if it's taking a withdrawal
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.300]   from your accounts to meet your expenses
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.420]   modeled in the tool.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.460]   The blue is representing your RMDs,
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.860]   your required minimum distributions.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.940]   And as we make changes in the tool
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.340]   and change our expenses or bring forward withdrawals,
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.220]   your RMDs will change and update in real time as well.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.740]   We have two other withdrawal strategies that you can model.
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.620]   Maximum spending is actually the opposite of spending needs
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.060]   when you're taking out only the expenses
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.500]   modeled in your plan.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.660]   Maximum spending is actually taking out,
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.940]   it's reducing your plan.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.580]   It's running an optimization to say,
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.940]   what if I wanted to deplete my assets
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.500]   for the entire plan by my longevity age?
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.060]   So I wanna deplete my assets by longevity.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.620]   How much can I take out every single year
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.540]   to maximize my spending and my enjoyment
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.500]   of my money throughout time?
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.420]   So from here, you're able to set the date
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.460]   of when you want that to start
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.980]   and then experiment with how much money you can take out.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.660]   So this can really help you have more comfort
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.820]   when making decisions.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.940]   If you're thinking about, can I afford to go on vacation
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.900]   or can I afford to buy an RV or a second home?
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.780]   We also have a fixed percent withdrawal strategy
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.140]   that kind of uses the 4% rule.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.140]   So we calculate 4% of your portfolio
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.020]   and inflate that over time
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.700]   and use that strategy for your withdrawals.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:48.860]   For expenses, we have lots of different ways
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.580]   to model expenses.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.380]   So you can just put in your monthly expenses.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.980]   You can model it by different phases of time.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.620]   So maybe before retirement, after retirement,
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.260]   maybe you're more into early retirement,
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.420]   mid retirement and later retirement.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.020]   So this can be really helpful.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.900]   If you wanna have a more detailed budget
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   and do line item modeling,
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.620]   then we have a planner plus a budgeter
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.420]   where you can enter in all of these expenses.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.660]   You can also take advantage of the ability
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.660]   to create multiple budgets,
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.980]   one for your basic expenses
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.860]   and one for more discretionary expenses
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.060]   so that you can match these up to your pessimistic
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.140]   or your optimistic assumptions.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:38.020]   Next, we can model our real estate.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.260]   So whether your primary residence is,
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.060]   you own it outright, you have a mortgage or you rent,
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.860]   you can model that here
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.340]   and we'll calculate the mortgage payments for you.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.020]   The most important part of this section
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.700]   is putting in the zip code of your primary residence
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.020]   'cause that's gonna actually determine
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.860]   your state tax structure.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.780]   For Roth conversions, we looked at federal tax structure.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.340]   For this section, I wanna look at state tax structure.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.260]   So living in California, it's a very high tax state.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.540]   We can see in the future while I'm working,
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.980]   there's a lot of taxes, as well as when I'm taking RMDs,
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.100]   there's also a lot of taxes.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.940]   So one thing we can do is model a change
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.660]   to our primary location.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.140]   Maybe we're thinking about relocating to Florida
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.380]   or Washington or Texas, a lower tax state.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.180]   So in this case, in this scenario,
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.940]   I'm thinking about, okay, at 65, I'm retired,
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.380]   I'm gonna sell my primary home
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.940]   and I'm gonna buy a home in Florida.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.940]   Okay, and when I look at this chart,
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.020]   I now can visually see the difference
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.780]   that I'm saving in taxes, which is pretty neat.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.060]   So if you're thinking about moving,
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.660]   this is a great thing to experiment with.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.980]   If you have other properties, you can also enter those.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.260]   And then you can also model purchasing
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.700]   or selling real estate in the future.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.620]   So we're not limiting you to just what you own now.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.980]   We really want you to be modeling everything
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.860]   because we wanna show your whole financial picture.
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:20.340]   In terms of medical, we have a couple calculations.
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.780]   We want you to model your expenses before Medicare.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:28.260]   And then we will estimate your Medicare cost
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.820]   based on a variety of different combinations of policies.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.540]   Well, this is really neat because if you say, you smoke,
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.140]   we're gonna increase your estimate.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.300]   This uses Medicare's API.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.300]   So all the information is up to date.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.420]   If you have other medical conditions,
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.660]   you're gonna increase your estimate.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.260]   If you have other medical conditions,
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.100]   you're gonna see your costs increase.
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.740]   Of course, these are estimations.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.620]   When you use estimate projected Medicare expenses,
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.500]   it will add in IRMA if that is something
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.660]   that you're subjected to.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.980]   So the additional amount of Medicare fees
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.940]   that you have to pay if you're above
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.980]   a certain adjusted gross income.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:17.940]   And lastly, we do a model long-term care.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.300]   So if you have a spike towards the end of your plan
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.900]   in terms of expenses, that little spike
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.100]   is for long-term care.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.580]   It's based on your longevity age
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.300]   and it kicks in three years before your longevity age.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:35.740]   So that's kind of the big overview of things
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.660]   that you can do in the tool.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.060]   After you go through all of your plan,
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.740]   you get all your information really accurate.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.380]   Then we recommend that you do a few things.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.380]   You go to coach suggestions.
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.860]   This is gonna run through your plan
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.900]   and it's gonna actually generate a series of rules
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.620]   that are gonna help you.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.500]   So if you have gone through and created,
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.100]   made adjustments to your plan,
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.020]   these are gonna change.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.620]   So if you looked at it at the beginning as we did,
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.460]   you wanna come back here to see if there are any changes.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.980]   And I think I'll pause here
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.060]   and maybe start taking questions.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.580]   (silence)
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:22.500]   - Michelle, a question for you.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.340]   - Sure.
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.340]   - I was trying to solve some user technical issues
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.140]   so I might've missed it if you talked about it.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.380]   I was just wondering about any incorporations
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.740]   of the recent rules for like the eight and a half percent
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.980]   healthcare and its effect on the subsidy
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.100]   or premium tax credit on the ACA stuff.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.340]   - Yeah, so right now ACA is not included.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.340]   That is something that you'd have to manually adjust for,
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.660]   but it is in our plans to add sometime later in the year.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.020]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.740]   I think you mentioned too that,
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.500]   I think you said a hundred dollars a month
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.020]   when I think you meant to say a hundred dollars a year
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.780]   when you went on the slide with the costs.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.900]   - That's the membership cost or the signup cost.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.460]   - Yeah, we charge $8 a month, but we charge it annually.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.540]   So it's $96 a year and that's an annual fee.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.700]   And then someone was asking,
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.140]   we do have a 14 day trial where you can try out everything
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.420]   that she's showing you.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.140]   And if you decide to cancel on the 14 days,
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.220]   we do ask for a credit card up front,
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.260]   but we will never charge you.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.300]   But for what it's worth, we are like,
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.380]   this is the challenge we have really.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.260]   It's like, what's interesting is we see traditional,
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.380]   not both of those people, but many folks,
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.860]   they go to wealth advisors and they'll pay 1%
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.340]   of their million bucks, $10,000 a year,
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.740]   and they're fine with it.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.140]   But then if you're like, oh, it's $100 for this.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.060]   They're like, wait, but I'm paying.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.060]   It's just a psychological difference that we see.
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.180]   - Yeah, we've heard that as we review tools.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.540]   Somebody say, well, you have this free tool,
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.500]   but the other one's $5 for 400 features.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.260]   And they balk at the $5.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.900]   So it's amazing to me when talking about the money
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.860]   you're talking about here, people's, you know,
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.940]   their savings.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.060]   There's a question.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.500]   Is the plan in the demo a reasonable one?
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.180]   The question is, it looks like having huge incomes,
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.620]   like greater than 500 grand a year in the later years
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.460]   while spending very little in the early years,
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:29.380]   or is just the first cut applying suggested improvements?
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.660]   - Yeah, so this plan is very heavy in assets.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.700]   It's a demo plan, so you want to take advantage
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.980]   of all of the different areas.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.780]   And I also want to be able to show Roth conversions
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.900]   in a very visual way.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.340]   So in order to do that, I did inflate the assets
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.020]   of savings and assets to give this person
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.660]   very large 401(k) and tax deferred balances.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.220]   - Okay, could you talk a little bit
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.780]   about your privacy policy?
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:03.140]   - Yeah, so all of our data is encrypted
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.260]   and we use like bank-level security
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.740]   where we go through constant iterations of, you know,
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.860]   taking security audits and risk measures.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:17.540]   And our security policy is on our website.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.460]   - Yeah, it's been validated.
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.980]   We have a privacy policy in terms of use.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.260]   We use a third-party group called TrustArk
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.540]   that reviews it every year.
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.500]   And we're also running our own security penetration tests
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.020]   and kind of auditing ourselves.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.060]   And in fact, I mean, one interesting thing is
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.500]   we also have members of our community.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.180]   We actually have a member of our community right now
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.860]   who's a recently retired security expert who was like,
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.740]   "Hey, listen, I'll volunteer my time to help you out."
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.740]   I mean, one thing that we see is actually
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.500]   our audience is full of very smart people
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.460]   who are super interested in this, who are helping us out.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.180]   And so, you know, where it makes sense,
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.540]   we'll definitely collaborate with folks.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.820]   But we take it super seriously.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:04.420]   We know that it's, you know, we're holding people's,
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.900]   you know, super important information.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.780]   Now, another way, one of the thought on this is
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.060]   we did actually purposely construct the tool
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.020]   so that you do put an email into create an account,
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.260]   but we don't ask for your full name, your phone number,
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.580]   your address, or anything else.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.700]   And if you don't wanna link accounts,
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.660]   you can just do it manually.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.180]   So you end up with, you know, you could semi-anonymize,
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.100]   you know, where your accounts,
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.900]   what your account names are,
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.660]   and then roughly put in your account values,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.180]   and you're not giving away that much information.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.300]   So we did that on purpose,
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.820]   but you can link accounts if you want to.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.500]   And we work with Plaid,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.060]   who's our, you know, data account linking provider.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.940]   They power many of the top sites out there,
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:48.780]   or most of them.
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.100]   - Thank you.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.660]   There's another question out there about state tax
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.620]   intricacies and the detail that required at the state level
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.900]   compared to the federal level.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.500]   How do you deal with the states?
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:05.300]   - Yeah, so we try to keep the state data
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.740]   as up-to-date as possible.
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.740]   So it does correlate with all our different account types,
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.140]   so contributions and withdrawal going in,
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.580]   withdrawals coming out.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.420]   We update everything once a year.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.340]   - Yeah, I mean, and one of this is,
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.340]   this also goes back to learning with our community.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.620]   We do hear, especially when we first rolled this out,
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.220]   you know, we'll hear from like a teacher,
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.780]   this is a true case, you know, in like New York,
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.140]   and they'll say, "Hey, my teacher's pension
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.740]   "is federally taxed, but not state taxed
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.020]   "'cause it's a state pension."
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.660]   And so we'll actually adapt the platform
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.660]   to handle that edge case.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:49.220]   So we, you know, this, we do have to continually
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.740]   update the platforms so the projections
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.860]   stay as accurate as possible.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.220]   And then we'll also shape it based on what we're hearing
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.660]   from live users.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.900]   You know, we have thousands of users
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.260]   every day on this platform.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.340]   - And could you speak to the, let's say,
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.700]   the architecture of the system?
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.860]   Like, is it in the cloud or where is it?
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.700]   Not in your basement, I hope, but.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.340]   [laughing]
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.940]   - Yeah, so it is on the cloud.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.180]   We actually did use to run our own data center way back,
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.420]   but it's all in the cloud.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:23.260]   And, you know, we use industry standard best practices.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.820]   I mean, it's built to scale.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.340]   I mean, one thing you'll see is when you're using a tool,
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.180]   like we are running thousands of my Carlo simulations
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.100]   behind the scenes, we have built the platform
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.740]   to be able to run.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.260]   So in our future vision, so there's 150,000 people
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.620]   that have created plans.
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.020]   You know, in the not too distant future,
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.860]   we wanna tax that to go to one and a half million people.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:46.500]   We wanna be able to run thousands of simulations per user
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.980]   on a regular basis.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.740]   So this will be, you know, billions of simulations
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.620]   we're running all the time.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.620]   So we have architected the system
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.100]   and then you'll see it's pretty responsive
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.780]   and fast to do that.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.340]   You know, we believe that planning can help
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.180]   not just people in the US when we have like people
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.940]   from India, Europe, all over the world using this thing,
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.140]   that it can help, you know, planning and education
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.340]   in a completely aligned way can help
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.660]   hundreds of millions of people.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.460]   I mean, there's 7 billion people in this plan.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.300]   A billion people have money, you know,
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.140]   and more are gonna get it as globalization happens
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.620]   and they need to make good financial decisions.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.900]   The people in this group represent the top,
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.460]   you know, 0.0001% of financially educated people.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:34.340]   And in an ideal future, we would leverage
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.060]   these kinds of communities to help other people
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.100]   that are much earlier in the education curve, you know,
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.260]   to make good choices for their whole lives.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.740]   - When you, Michelle,
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.740]   when you showed us those recommendations,
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.060]   after you put in the rough cut plan,
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.940]   you went into a screen that had like six
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.740]   or eight recommendations.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.260]   From your experience with all your users,
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.180]   what are the most common recommendations
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.340]   that people are missing that they should be doing?
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.940]   The suggestions from the coach, let's say.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.780]   - Yeah.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.980]   - In a bulk with all your users
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.740]   and what you guys have seen.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.380]   - So we run this across, you know,
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.860]   over a hundred different rules and regulations.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.220]   You know, almost everybody,
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.900]   we recommend review your plan with your spouse,
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.140]   you know, socialize it, talk about it,
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.100]   use this as a opportunity to talk about values,
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.820]   especially with someone who's not quite as interested
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.420]   in money 'cause usually the person who's super interested
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.540]   and makes this their hobby is the one filling out this plan.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.940]   You know, we'll also run different calculations to see,
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.460]   you know, oh, this is out of average,
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.340]   or, you know, you missed an input.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.140]   Often people will forget to put in medical expenses
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.580]   before Medicare.
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.300]   That's a very common one.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.860]   Sometimes people will forget to put in a zip code
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.820]   in home and real estate,
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.220]   which is really important to take advantage
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.180]   of the more detailed state tax calculations.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:07.180]   We'll run a lot of like scenarios to say,
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.460]   you know what, you've selected to withdraw money
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.500]   before you're 59 and a half, there might be a penalty.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.140]   Now we don't model what the penalty would be,
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.140]   but we do try to alert you of any potential risks
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.260]   in your plan so you know where to investigate further.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.500]   - I think you may have mentioned it,
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.260]   but do you take care of the IRMA surcharge
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.420]   on the high income, look back for Medicare?
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.260]   - We do.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.860]   So we definitely take care of IRMA in the background.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.180]   It's part of your medical assumption
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.780]   when you think about medical estimates.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.260]   You know, one thing I didn't show
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.380]   are a lot of the insights charts.
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.340]   Once you enter your accurate plan,
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.540]   then we have all these charts
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.740]   that show very, very detailed assumptions.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.140]   So here we're looking at the projections
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.620]   of estimated income and estimated expenses.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.940]   So here, when we look at just this blue
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.060]   or our lifetime medical expenses,
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.380]   you know, this is inclusive of all your premiums,
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.140]   all your co-pays, long-term care insurance, IRMA,
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.740]   everything is all wrapped in these.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.820]   And then you can click on any year
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.660]   to kind of freeze it in time for that year.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.460]   So I'm looking at when I'm 77,
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.420]   it's telling me exactly what my medical projections may be.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.540]   And then these are all in future dollars.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.700]   (silence)
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:31.140]   - Michelle, there was a question earlier
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.980]   and I don't know if you covered it.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.100]   I stepped away for a minute.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.860]   It asked about if there was a spot for real estate taxes.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.700]   Obviously we have people from around the country
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.140]   with vastly different property taxes.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.460]   Is there a spot for that in there?
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.460]   - Yeah, so one thing that we do
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.820]   is we ask for, you know, your current home value
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:56.540]   and, you know, then we estimate what you might sell it for,
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.460]   but we actually don't calculate the tax
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.620]   because so many people do customize strategies
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.740]   with depreciation, 1031 exchanges.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.820]   So what we do recommend is that you kind of figure out
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.340]   what you think that your tax liability will be,
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.100]   you know, based on what you bought the house for.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.580]   We don't ask for that.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.180]   And then put that amount in expenses modeled as an expense
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.060]   because that's gonna make your plan a little more accurate.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:22.900]   - Thank you.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:30.740]   - One other thing that I didn't show
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.980]   is the Roth conversion explorer.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.300]   So Steve has mentioned this a few times.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.380]   It's actually an engine that's kind of looking at your plan
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.780]   and calculating thousands of different combinations
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.580]   to try to figure out what strategy for Roth conversions
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:52.380]   is gonna generate the largest estate at longevity.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.620]   So this ran through my plan and it's projecting that,
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.740]   you know, if I do Roth conversions,
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:01.460]   I might have over 2 million more dollars
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.580]   at the end of my plan or my longevity.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.660]   It's gonna give me the year to convert, each age,
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.620]   what account and the amount that it should come from.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.420]   Now, right now, this tool is separate from the plan.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.940]   So you actually have to manually enter it in your plan.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.940]   But what this does is it really like gives you
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.100]   a starting point for your strategy
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.060]   and it helps you think about it in, you know,
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.620]   a way that is very hard to calculate on your own
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.860]   because it's including all of the different aspects
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.700]   of our plan.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.380]   It's including new income coming in,
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.020]   it's including taxes, it's including IRMA,
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.140]   it's including, you know,
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.300]   how your expenses change from year to year.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.780]   So it's pretty neat.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:40.900]   As I scroll down the page,
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.860]   you can actually see the comparison of taxes
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.180]   between the plan that you have modeled
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.300]   and the plan in the Explorer.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.180]   So you kind of notice that, you know,
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:54.700]   with your current plan, you're paying less taxes upfront,
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.980]   but then it kind of switches.
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.860]   And in the future, the Roth optimized plan,
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.820]   you're paying less taxes.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.940]   And this is actually one place where we do expose IRMA.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.700]   So if you are looking for that, you can see it here,
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.500]   that in the optimized plan,
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.980]   by doing those conversions earlier,
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.760]   for a long period of time in the future,
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.560]   you're actually reducing your IRMA surcharge completely.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:29.380]   - Michelle, we have also a question
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.300]   about can we handle income from an S-corp
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.380]   where not all income is taxed the same way?
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.420]   - Yeah, so for real estate and S-corp,
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.740]   the way that we recommend doing it
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.480]   is instead of putting in the gross amount,
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.020]   that you put in the profit amount as income.
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.320]   That's where we are today.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:43:03.280]   - Michelle, I think there was a question earlier
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.640]   about changes in asset allocation through time.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.680]   Could you speak to that a little bit more?
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.620]   - Yeah, so what we do right now is,
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.220]   sorry, let's go to the right page.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.540]   On the savings and assets page,
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:21.700]   we ask for two different values,
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.300]   an optimistic and a pessimistic growth rate.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.940]   And that's so you can toggle between these.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.900]   You'll see your whole plan update in real time,
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.540]   depending if you choose optimistic or pessimistic.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.480]   The optimistic and pessimistic growth rates
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.060]   are how we mirror the asset allocation
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.720]   that's actually in this account.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.880]   So when I look at my 401(k)
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.720]   and I see a growth rate of 8% and 5%,
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.800]   I think it's invested in growth stocks.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.880]   Now, today, this represents
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.440]   over the same value every single year.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.160]   So you really wanna choose a value
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.680]   that is like a rolling average,
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   not necessarily representative of just a couple years.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.220]   You wanna think about the entire time span.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.080]   There are ways to kind of override it
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.880]   and kind of shift money into another account
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.200]   if you really wanna completely change your asset allocation.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.920]   In general, just recommend that you pick a happy medium
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.920]   that is representative of the entire lifespan of your account.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.640]   - Yeah, I think what they're asking for is,
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.000]   I'm 45 and I don't mind being 100% in the stock market,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.960]   but by the time I get to be 65,
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.200]   I wanna be 50% in the market.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.220]   And by the time I'm 80,
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.060]   I wanna be 90% in bonds or something like that.
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.420]   I think that's the idea.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:43.220]   - So we'll be making updates to asset allocation
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.900]   to include that functionality
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.820]   and some other stuff around just being able to pick,
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.540]   I'm in growth funds, I'm in bonds,
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.980]   and make these projections a lot easier.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.460]   In general, this tool is super flexible
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:59.720]   and there's definitely a workaround for everything.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.060]   So today, the workaround
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:04.080]   for completely shifting your asset
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.680]   is to actually just create a second temporary plan
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.780]   that will be in the future
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:15.680]   and then manually transfer the balance into that new account
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.720]   using our manual withdrawal and transfer area.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.060]   And then you're able to kind of, in the future,
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.240]   shift the money and then it starts growing
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.360]   at a different rate that might be more conservative.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.000]   - Yeah, I mean, to be fair, I mean, we are definitely,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.280]   we're hearing this from other people too.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:34.280]   So we are working on a UX redo of this whole section
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:38.400]   to make it simpler to do what we're hearing from users,
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.700]   which one of them is like, hey, I will,
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.420]   I'm planning on essentially de-risking my portfolio
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.260]   as I get older.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:53.220]   - Do we have any other questions?
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.680]   You can put them in the chat.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:59.680]   - Let's do one more chart 'cause I didn't show this yet.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:08.000]   This is pretty nifty.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.160]   It's our tax projection chart.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.360]   So we've looked at some of these values already
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.920]   as a small chart, but this is a much larger chart.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.800]   This is showing you your projections for estimated taxes.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.760]   It's showing you the actual like source of the tax
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.120]   of how we're figuring it out.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.480]   And then it's also showing your tax deductions,
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.640]   whether you're taking a standard deduction
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.160]   or you're able to kind of benefit
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.800]   from some other information.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.240]   And then at the bottom, we have this larger chart again,
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.340]   that's showing the different tax brackets.
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.960]   Something crazy is going on with this chart,
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.600]   but normally it shows standard deductions.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.880]   We have a question about modifying values.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.040]   Yeah, we basically restricted Planner
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.840]   to limit the changing of rates
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.320]   and that's only available in PLOS.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.320]   But again, if you really wanna not pay anything,
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.680]   you can sign up for PLOS, put a credit card in,
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.880]   change everything, print your plan, cancel,
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.960]   and you'll have a complete plan.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.520]   In fact, and we'll also save the data.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.120]   What you'll lose is the ability to make changes
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.420]   in the future and kind of manage it over time.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:23.620]   And we have had some users game us where they're like,
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.620]   they'll do that, cancel, come back a year later,
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.060]   sign up, cancel.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.220]   But for what, I mean, really like we're trying
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.420]   to build a business that does this in a very different way,
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:36.940]   but we can only do it if the model works at scale,
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.620]   like we get enough users that support
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.620]   kind of how we're trying to do business.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:49.140]   Michelle, there's a question about tax rate assumptions
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:54.140]   and future tax rates changing or sunsetting.
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:56.740]   If you wanna maybe talk about how that would be modified
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.580]   or such in there.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.820]   - Yeah, so the tax structure that we use
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:01.940]   is today's current tax structure,
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:04.500]   and that's used for the duration of the plan.
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.700]   So we use today's tax structure for today
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.020]   and in the future.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:13.100]   We do get a lot of requests to be able to model
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:16.540]   the projected potential change in 2026,
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.780]   and even change, be able to adjust
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.220]   to make the future have a higher tax rate.
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.900]   So it's something that we're thinking about
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.580]   and considering, we know it's a highly desired feature.
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:31.860]   - Thank you, and then there was a question there
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:36.500]   about matching an advisor with a client.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.380]   How do you do that?
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.060]   Do you have any criteria for that?
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:44.380]   - So we're talking a lot about our service model right now,
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.980]   and Michelle actually, in addition to like managing
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.860]   and doing all these demos and everything else,
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:49.700]   runs services for us.
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:53.020]   So we, today we have a very limited,
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.660]   we have advisors internally,
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.900]   but we are looking at making this available
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.580]   to through other advisors,
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.460]   that offer at least flat fee
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.100]   and completely transparent pricing.
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:12.940]   Users can definitely take this and many of them do.
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.460]   They sign up themselves and they have an advisor
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.140]   and they share it with their advisor,
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.180]   either the printed version
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.820]   or they collaboratively do it with them.
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.260]   We are gonna be making collaborative planning.
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.500]   We do it internally,
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.260]   but we'll make that easier for the user to control
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.420]   or they can grant access to other people if they want to.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:34.620]   You'll see that evolve over the course of this year.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:38.300]   We're not really, I mean, our main focus is the software
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:43.300]   and supporting the user base and changing it very quickly.
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:48.300]   Our expertise is not building a giant CFP network.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.940]   - Steve, on one of those screens,
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:54.860]   you talked about refactoring the UX
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.300]   for asset allocation things.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.020]   Could you just tell us about that process
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.020]   when you get a bunch of requests on the same thing
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:04.460]   and you guys decide to go down the path and make the changes
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.300]   and how does that actually happen?
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.220]   And then how do you test that what you did
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.420]   didn't blow up other things and how do you roll it out?
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.300]   - Sure, so our team has grown
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.740]   and we basically doubled in the past year
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:23.980]   and we did get a little institutional funding,
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.660]   but we're still relatively lightly funded company.
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:30.220]   We've raised a total of $5 million in this company,
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.540]   which is like nothing compared to like a personal capital
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.500]   that's raised $250 million, which is good
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.940]   because we're focused on keeping our costs low
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.100]   and keeping our infrastructure costs super low
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.860]   so that we can keep our prices low.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.820]   But basically, yeah, we hear from users.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.380]   We do a lot of support.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.740]   So Michelle's team does all the intercom chat support.
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.540]   So we'll hear from users that way, office hours, AMAs.
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:56.780]   We definitely are listening to users all the time
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.500]   and seeing what they want.
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:02.220]   And then we have a roadmap that where we're decking up,
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.220]   hey, this is what users want.
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.660]   This is where we think the product needs to go.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.580]   We design those things.
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:10.620]   We use some various back office testing platforms
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:11.700]   so we can test the UX.
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.740]   We also have a beta program, which you can be part of
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:17.580]   and certain features you'll see are marked as beta.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.060]   So if you're in the beta program,
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.660]   there's actually two levels.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.220]   There's like, hey, you have to be part of the beta program
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.020]   to even see it.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.860]   And then we'll make something beta
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.020]   and publicly available, but it's still marked as beta
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.860]   'cause it's still being worked on.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:35.860]   So we kind of roll it out in phases.
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.660]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.900]   - And just to answer your testing questions
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.420]   and accuracy questions, I mean, we do a lot of,
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.460]   so we write unit tests for the software.
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.860]   We can run simulations.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:54.860]   So like this past quarter, we created the ability to run,
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.100]   we actually used to run forecasts locally on your machine.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.820]   Now we run them server side.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.780]   So like, for instance, we're rolling out some changes
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.020]   to our scoring methodology right now.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.860]   So we are running scores for high scores
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.620]   and we are running scores for hundreds of thousands
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:14.060]   of people behind the scenes or accounts behind the scenes
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.860]   to make sure that the changes that we're doing
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:22.060]   as a way to kind of like test them all at once.
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.300]   I mean, this is all kept internal,
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:27.420]   but we basically run simulations and unit tests
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.500]   at scale today behind the scenes
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.500]   in order to kind of like see how are these changes
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.220]   affecting people's plans.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:40.500]   - Okay, there's a couple of more questions in the chat.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.140]   Does the plan model the indexing
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.700]   of the standard deduction and tax bracket?
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:48.260]   Basically, does it assume the top of the 22% bracket
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:51.700]   in 20 years is the same dollar amount as today
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:54.460]   or does it go up by some amount?
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.020]   - So we increase the brackets and the deductions,
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.860]   the rates stay the same.
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.460]   And those increase based on your inflation rate
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.860]   that you've put in.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.340]   So we model, I pointed out that you can model
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.460]   the social security inflation rate.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.900]   You can also model home and real estate separately,
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.940]   medical inflation separately,
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:15.380]   and then a general inflation rate for expenses.
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.180]   And so the tax is increased
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.780]   with the general inflation rate that you've modeled.
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:23.140]   - Okay, and here's the question.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:25.860]   Did you see the question there about the MFJ?
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.700]   - Well, the other part of that question
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:33.700]   was about standard deductions and itemized.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.540]   So the tool actually go through
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:42.020]   and only if you use the budgeter for expenses,
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:44.660]   it will calculate whether or not
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:47.140]   it thinks you're better off itemized taxes
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.780]   or standard deduction.
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.780]   And within the budget,
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:53.140]   you can actually set different items to be tax deductible.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.900]   So if you're making charitable gifts
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.500]   or you're taking write-offs for business
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:02.260]   or other purposes, property taxes,
[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:05.220]   it will factor that into your tax calculation.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:09.900]   - Here, I'll take the question about Monte Carlo and income.
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.060]   I mistyped in there.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.300]   So basically we want to,
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:16.500]   we're rolling out Monte Carlo
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:21.420]   for every investable asset class that has risk
