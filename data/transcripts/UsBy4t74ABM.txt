[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   So I've been thinking a lot recently about discipline.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.720]   Now I don't mean punishing other people.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.120]   I also don't mean those performative shows on social media where you brag about how
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.680]   many miles you can run or how many minutes you can survive a cold plunge.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.240]   I mean, instead the quiet contentment of consistently making progress on
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.720]   things that are hard right now, but move you towards meaningful goals in the future.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.680]   Now, this is the problem with talking about discipline is that it is hard
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.360]   to get the definition straight.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480]   Uh, there's a lot of confusion about exactly what we mean.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600]   So I wanted to actually do something different with our
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.280]   conversation about discipline today.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   I want to start with a concrete case study.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.400]   Excuse me.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.160]   This is a question posed in a recent Reddit thread on the life
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.440]   pro tips, Reddit, uh, community that I think is going to make concrete what we
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.200]   mean when we talk about discipline.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.400]   All right.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.600]   So this is a real Reddit thread.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.440]   I want to read here to prime our discussion.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.320]   Now, this is not a work school related post.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.520]   I generally don't have any major problems with procrastination or meeting deadlines.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.280]   I'm structured in how I work and get things done when they are expected of me.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.680]   However, in my personal life, I always seem to put off things I want to do in
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.160]   favor of playing video games, watching movies, or scrolling on social media.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.600]   I love painting and being creative, but rarely make time to do it.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.720]   Even though it does seem to make me very happy when I do, I tend to skip social
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.560]   occasions because I want to stay home and play some video games, even though I
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.840]   always enjoy myself when I do push myself to go, I've always wanted to learn a new
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.320]   language, but when it comes down to it, I don't make the time to do it without
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.080]   external pressure.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.240]   I choose an easy dopamine hit 95% of the time.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.800]   Any advice, advice on how to make it easier to choose the things that take a
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.440]   bit more effort up front, but will make me happier in the long run.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.760]   All right.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.120]   So I like this because it's concrete.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.880]   This is what we mean by discipline.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.480]   Being able to consistently work on your art or learning the language or going to
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.640]   the meaningful social event.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.040]   When in the moment, it would be much easier just to play video games.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.040]   And of course we could replace video games here with look at your phone, get
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.360]   lost on YouTube, drink, whatever it is, eat, distracting food, get lost in
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.040]   binging on dumb shows online, whatever it is, we all have our own version of video
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.400]   games.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.080]   So this is what I want to talk about.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.920]   I want to talk about discipline through the lens of this specific example, and I
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.560]   want to get practical here.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.200]   I want to get practical advice for how to improve your discipline.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.920]   I'm going to use this case study as a guide and divide my answer into two
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.600]   parts, because we see there's two parts to the question.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.200]   So the first part is how do you resist playing that proverbial video game so
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.600]   often?
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.520]   How do you resist the lure of the non-discipline shallow?
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.720]   So we'll start by talking about exactly that challenge.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.080]   Then part two of this question will be part two of this segment.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.920]   We'll talk about how do you make the deep, meaningful effort to learning a
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.360]   language, to working on your art?
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.320]   How do you make that more appealing and more consistent?
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.240]   So how do you reduce the negative?
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.840]   And then how do you increase the positive?
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.480]   That's the way we're going to structure our discussion of discipline today.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.360]   All right, let's start with this first part, resisting the proverbial video
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.800]   game.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   I want to do a little bit of neuroscience here, but not too much.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.600]   And I'm going to do it with some trepidation.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.480]   It's easy to get overconfident in summarizing neuroscience, which is in my
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.840]   experience, always much more complicated than you think.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.120]   So we're going to, with some caveats here, give a little bit of neuroscience
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.040]   we're going to use to generate our advice.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.960]   All right, I'm going to read a quote from a 2010 survey article that appeared in
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.280]   the journal Neuron that talks about how our brain deals with the prospect of an
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.720]   immediate reward.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.440]   All right, so I'm quoting now.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.960]   "Most goal-directed motivation, even the seeking of food or water, is learned.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.200]   It is largely through selective reinforcement of initially random
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.080]   movements that the behavior of the neonate comes to be both directed at and
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.520]   motivated by appropriate stimuli in the environment.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.160]   For the most part, one's motivation is to return to the rewards experienced in
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.440]   the path and to the cues that marked a way to such rewards.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.080]   It is primarily through its role in the selective reinforcement of associations
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.040]   between rewards and otherwise neural stimuli that dopamine is important for
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.960]   such motivation.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.560]   Once stimulus reward associations have been formed, they can remain potent for
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.840]   some time."
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.800]   This is what you're dealing with when you see that phone or the video game is
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.960]   lying there, and you feel that strong attraction to play it.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.320]   It's a type of short-term planning that's sometimes called reflexive planning,
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.840]   where your brain has hard-coded this stimuli, seeing the video game controller
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.120]   in the living room, seeing the phone in my hand or on the table next to me.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.960]   The stimuli is directly connected to a reward that we've experienced in the
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.160]   past. And through having this immediate reward occur enough times, we've had
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.720]   dopamine mediated reinforcement learning, which means we've meant to connect now
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.000]   our neurons will connect that stimulus with that reward.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.760]   So when we see the stimulus, we get a neurochemical flush that is experienced
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.320]   as motivation to do the activity.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.680]   It's very tempting to pick up the phone, it's very tempting to pick up the
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.800]   controller, it's very tempting to go pour that drink.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.200]   So how do we reduce this urge?
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.000]   How do we reduce the urge to do the immediate but shallow?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.320]   All right, I have three things to suggest here that are concrete.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.440]   Two of them are obvious, one of them is a little bit more subtle.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.480]   Number one, reduce the stimuli, right?
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.880]   So we can actually look at just not encountering that stimuli to which we've
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.480]   learned the connection to the reward, not encountering that stimuli as much.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.080]   This is where, for example, on the show, we often talk about the phone foyer
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.080]   method, where you don't keep your phone with you when you're at home, it's in
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.200]   another room, so you're not seeing the phone.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.080]   It could be taking apart your video game system when you're not playing, putting
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.880]   the controllers with the actual box into a closet somewhere, not just having it
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.720]   out and being easy to play.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.880]   You can also do this by taking, for example, applications off your phone so
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.040]   that when you do pick up your phone to do something like listen to a podcast, you
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.760]   don't see the app for TikTok right there.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.880]   All this is about stimuli reduction.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.920]   It makes sense in the light of this basic neuroscience that we just reviewed,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.560]   if you don't encounter the stimuli, there is no trigger of that neurochemical
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.200]   urge to do the action.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.360]   All right, well, here's the second obvious piece of advice.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.000]   Encode related, but alternative rewards.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.840]   So teach your brain to enjoy through reinforcement learning, other things that
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.800]   are rewarding that are better for you or more meaningful or less time consuming
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.360]   than the thing that you're worried about.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.200]   This is very common with, uh, food and drug related motivational centers, you
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   know, uh, Hey, I'm used to pouring this drink when I get home from work, but I'm
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.320]   trying to stop drinking.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.000]   So you have like an alternative activity you start doing when you get home from
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.800]   work, just rewarding in its own way, but doesn't involve alcohol.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.720]   Uh, and then you begin to really enjoy that other routine.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.200]   So it's still like I come home and I go for a jog while listening to music.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.480]   I really like, or like a fun podcast and your mind learns to really like that too.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.960]   And so now the stimuli of coming home has this other association that's
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.160]   going to be, uh, less harmful.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.080]   So you can encode alternative rewards just through pure
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.360]   engineered exposure to them.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.760]   So there's other stimuli that when you get that stimuli, that would normally
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.120]   make you do the thing you don't want to do.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.440]   You're motivated to do things you do want to do.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.000]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.320]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.080]   need to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, the Lost Art of
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.560]   Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.240]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.560]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.160]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.240]   Check it out.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.600]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.800]   The final piece of advice here is going to be more subtle.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.080]   You become comfortable with being uncomfortable.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:37.280]   Now here I'm drawing from something I read from the, uh, the, the former
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.480]   professor and, and writer, Michael Easter and his book, The Comfort Crisis,
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.360]   which I read last month.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.920]   We talked about that in the book roundup a couple of weeks ago.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.040]   In his book, Michael Easter talked about this pioneering nutritionist
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.760]   named Trevor Kashi, K-A-S-H-E-Y, who has had fantastic success with helping
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.280]   people lose weight and get, um, into better shape.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.920]   So I'm going to quote a little bit here from Easter.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.520]   This is actually a summary Easter wrote of this chapter of his book.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.440]   Let me quote a little bit about Kashi, um, from Easter himself.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.480]   And then I'm going to apply this to what we're talking about here.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.280]   So in the book, this is Easter talking about his own book.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:24.440]   In the book, Kashi suggests finding calorie negative ways of coping with stress.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.200]   His number one recommendation is walking.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.680]   It relieves stress, put distance between you and the temptation
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.760]   to eat and burns calories.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.040]   It also gives you the opportunity to think about why you want to eat.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.720]   Developed by, uh, Trevor Kashi nutrition plan first comes down to this and
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.800]   awareness well before he addresses eating specific foods to reduce body fat.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.520]   So what is Trevor Kashi doing?
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.880]   He's saying, why are people, you know, part of why people are eating more than
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:55.640]   they should is because they are, um, they're feeling these motivate dopamine
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:02.360]   derived or mediated motivational urges to, to eat the bad food, right?
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.920]   The stimuli is I'm stressed.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.520]   The response I've been trained for is, uh, grab the chips.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.480]   And so what Kashi does, he said, forget at first talking about what you should
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.840]   eat or why chips are bad, or like what the right amount of food to eat is.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.440]   Kashi says, no, what we got to start with is that exact response.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.040]   Why are you eating the stuff?
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.840]   You know, you shouldn't eat.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.880]   Well, you have this particular response.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.480]   So let's deal with that response.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.000]   This is probably for a lot of people at stress, but for other people, it's
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.040]   boredom or whatever, uh, or sociality, social context, but you have these
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.320]   stimuli as you're connecting with certain types of eating and he says, well, we're
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.640]   going to deal directly with that.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.040]   And that's where he recommends like walking, for example, you have other
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.360]   things you do in response to those stimuli, but one of the, the, where the
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.400]   advice ends up, and this is how Michael Easter summarizes this in his book.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.200]   Where the advice ends up is ultimately too, you have to just be okay.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.240]   With the discomfort of your feelings, motivation to do this thing.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.560]   And you don't, and just be more okay than most people are with like, yeah,
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.000]   that feels uncomfortable with food.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.440]   It's often this, uh, dopamine mediated motivation response is felt as a feeling
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.440]   of hunger, as well as a sort of attraction.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.200]   It's like, it's hunger and attraction.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.360]   And Kashi says, it's just be a little bit.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:14.600]   Okay.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.800]   Being a little bit hungry, you know, because see part of what happens, this
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.600]   is a big thesis from Easter's book.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.160]   Part of what happens is we have a very comfortable life.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160]   Um, we lose all comfort with discomfort.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.400]   So we're really susceptible to these motivational or motivational short
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.360]   term motivational system, pushing us towards things, because if we resist
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.280]   that, it feels uncomfortable and we flee discomfort.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.680]   He's just said, what if we just get more comfortable with being.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.280]   A little bit uncomfortable.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.320]   And if you work with Trevor Kashi, it's part of what he works with you on is he
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.440]   says, uh, let's get used to being a little bit hungry, nothing bad's going to happen.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.080]   It's just a feeling you can separate yourself from that feeling.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.800]   You'll eat again soon.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.240]   You're not going to starve.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.960]   It's not the hunger pains of actual fasting.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.200]   You'll be okay.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.320]   And in the book, Easter talks about, uh, working with Kashi and how like over
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.160]   time, he just got more comfortable with like a certain parts of the day.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.280]   I feel kind of a little more hungrier and then I'm okay.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.240]   It's not the worst thing in the world that applies to almost any of these
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.040]   short-term motivational system cues.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.600]   It feels uncomfortable when you don't pick up your phone, because not only
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.760]   does the system make you motivated to pick it up, but it motivates it by making
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.600]   your current situation feel uncomfortable.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.400]   I mean, if we really get subtle about what are these motivational impulses feel like.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:36.240]   It's often presented to us as a solution to a current discomfort, right?
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.720]   How does our body motivate us to eat?
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.840]   It makes us feel the discomfort of hunger.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.000]   And it lets us imagine that picking up that food is going
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.040]   to make that hunger go away.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.000]   Well, the same thing happens with the video games or with the phones.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.840]   Uh, we feel the discomfort of, uh, boredom or stress.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.120]   And we have the senses.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.760]   Like when we pick that thing up, that's going to go away.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.400]   It's the alleviation of the discomfort.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:04.320]   Uh, drinkers will tell you about this, that the motivational system, uh, drug
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.720]   users as well, the motivational system that kicks in, that makes you want to
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   like pick up the, that drink or the drug, um, how you feel in the moment.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.080]   What does that anticipation feel like?
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.440]   You actually start feeling terrible.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.640]   You feel bad in the moment.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.360]   Like you'll get stressed or feel there'll be a physical discomfort that builds up
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.560]   that your mind can then say, this will be alleviated.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.400]   That's very powerful.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.720]   It'll be alleviated by doing that.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.080]   So we have to become more comfortable with discomfort to, again, succeed
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.720]   with not letting the short-term motivational system just rule
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.760]   what's going on in our life.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.800]   That's part one, resisting the proverbial video game.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:43.040]   Part two in this example is how do you, uh, motivate yourself
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.400]   to do something harder instead?
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.440]   So we want to make the distraction less appealing.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.760]   We want to make the target more meaningful activity, more appealing.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.640]   A little bit more neuroscience here is going to help.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.000]   But again, I'm going to be very, very high level in particular.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   What I'm going to do here is read a sentence from the press release.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.000]   Describing a brand new paper that appeared in nature neuroscience, a very
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.040]   interesting kind of landmark paper on long-term planning, but the press release
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:17.200]   had a good summary by one of the authors about how does our brain generate
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.080]   motivation for doing things that are not going to give us an immediate reward.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.320]   But, you know, down the line may give us a reward.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.360]   It's, it's a short-term thing that's hard, but it'll help us make progress
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.960]   towards a long-term good thing.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.680]   So let me read this quote from the press release surrounding this paper.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:41.240]   The prefrontal cortex acts as a simulator, mentally testing out possible actions
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:46.960]   using a cognitive map stored in the hippocampus explains Marcella Mattar,
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.560]   an assistant professor at New York university's department of psychology
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.560]   and one of the papers authors.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.800]   So what happens here is you read more in this paper and the paper is not
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.680]   just about how this works.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.800]   It builds a model for it.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.760]   But what you learn in this paper is that you have the prefrontal cortex and
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.960]   the hippocampus work together when coming up with long-term plans and
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.680]   having them motivate future behavior.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.680]   So the prefrontal cortex is simulating.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.480]   Where is this going to lead us down the line?
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.880]   This thing we want to do now, and it relies on the hippocampus, which is
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.840]   where memories are stored to help evaluate the simulation outcomes.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.040]   So it uses your past experience to understand like, okay, so if we end
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.720]   up over here, is that good or bad?
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.920]   And your hippocampus has stored these experiences or memories or
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.560]   exposures to what it means to be quote unquote over there.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.280]   And you can sort of evaluate the value of the different things you're simulating.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.920]   So you have this map and you have this memory store and together you can do
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.400]   these simulations of the future.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.600]   And if you find a good path forward, that's possible and leads to a place
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.120]   that you associate with good things, you get motivation.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:59.120]   And that's how you make progress on the longer-term goals.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.400]   So how do we make that easier?
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.600]   Well, again, I have three pieces of advice to offer here, two more
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.760]   practical and one that's going to be a little bit more subtle.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.600]   So the first practical advice, drawing from this neuroscience,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.320]   improve your cognitive map.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:19.520]   So what I mean by that is improve your understanding of how the thing
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.800]   you're doing actually works so that your brain knows this is how people learn a
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.880]   language, this is how people get to this particular level of being an artist,
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.360]   which is very appealing to me.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.240]   This is how people actually become professional genre novel writers.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.800]   This is what's actually involved.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:43.480]   The more detailed your cognitive map, the better simulations your brain can do.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.080]   So this requires you learn about the thing, whatever this goal is, you got
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.960]   to rabbit hole and obsess on it for a little bit.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.520]   You read the forums and books and you, you watch videos.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.600]   This is the fun part, right?
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.040]   You go deep on Reddit threads.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:03.000]   Like you really learn this world, like how it actually works.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.400]   This doesn't require a lot of effort, but it makes your
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.040]   cognitive map much more rich.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.840]   All right.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.480]   Number two, boost what's stored in your hippocampus.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.320]   So now you have a better understanding of how this world works.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:24.840]   You need to store in your hippocampus, lots of examples of this thing succeeding
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.920]   that are very positive and very inspiring.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:32.000]   So you have to fill your hippocampus with these things, these memories that when
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.440]   your prefrontal cortex is trying to evaluate a particular path forward, it
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.560]   will look to your hippocampus, bring for these examples and say, Oh, that's great.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.320]   That feels good.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.400]   So we do want to do this.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.960]   So this means exposing yourself constantly to positive examples of people who have
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.480]   succeeded with the thing you're interested in, examples that inspire you or motivate
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.760]   you, and you want to have these as richly encoded as possible.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.880]   So video is great.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.840]   Audio is great.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:02.200]   Read, meet people in person, and you want to essentially fill your hippocampus
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.680]   with these positive examples.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.120]   And this is why when people are trying to get, you know, stronger in a certain
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.840]   type of way, like they're constantly watching influencers online and YouTube
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.120]   videos and talking to other people who are in really good shape, this is not
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.960]   some sort of narcissism or vainness.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.120]   They're actually doing something really smart here.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.440]   They're filling their hippocampus with very strong examples that resonate.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.600]   This is going to allow this whole simulation system to work better.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.040]   So master the field, like really understand the field and keep exposing
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.280]   yourselves to examples of what you really want to do.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.120]   So like, let's be specific.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.560]   Let's say, you know, you're, you have this long-term thing you want to make
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.200]   disciplined action on that's like writing a genre novel.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.600]   You got to really understand how writing really works.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.080]   Talk to real writers, read interviews with real writers.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.120]   How did they get good enough to write this first book?
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.480]   What was actually involved in, you know, doing this?
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   What are the steps?
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.560]   What marks a good book from a bad book?
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.880]   Did they have to go to writing workshops as part of this?
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.320]   Whatever you need, you really learn to feel.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.960]   Talk to an agent, talk to other people who have failed at this.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.800]   Why did they fail?
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.000]   Join a writer's group, right?
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.520]   And then you have to constantly be exposing yourself to the
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.280]   most exciting examples possible.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.560]   Watch those videos of Brandon Sanderson's underground layer.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.840]   I'm like, man, imagine like a fantasy writer who like has this underground
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.520]   layer, read interviews with writers where it's really inspiring when they
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.640]   talk about where they go to write and what their life has been like while
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.960]   they're doing it, this is all really important to when it comes time for
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   you to actually sit down and write, you're going to be more likely
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.000]   to be motivated to do it.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.560]   All right.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.800]   So my third piece of advice here is going to be the subtle one.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:46.640]   Distinguish this unique flavor of motivation.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.920]   There's not something I've heard written about or talked about a lot, but it's
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.640]   something I really believe is true.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:59.480]   There is overlap in the motivational systems involved when we're talking
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.920]   about these short-term rewards and the long-term planning, there's overlap.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.640]   For example, dopamine is a mediating neurochemical in both of these.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.960]   The striatum in the brain is involved in both of these, but they're
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.720]   not the exact same systems, right?
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.120]   They don't unfold.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.200]   Resulting motivation does not unfold from a neuroscientific
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.920]   perspective, the exact same way.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.400]   Like when it comes to the short-term stimulus response, you have particular
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.480]   neurons that are probably, or clusters of neurons that are connected to this
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.320]   exact stimulus that can fire pretty quickly when they recognize what that is
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.760]   and get a direct motivational response.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.680]   Obviously, when you're doing long-term planning, the neuroscientific
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.560]   machinations here are way more complex.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.600]   You have the prefrontal cortex, you have the hippocampus, the signals
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.200]   that produce is going to be different.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.160]   The motivation response itself is going to be different.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.400]   If we're going to make this less neuroscience and more practical, another
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.720]   way of saying it is that motivation will feel different.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   There's a subtlety to it.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.880]   There's a difference between the urge I feel to pick up my phone and the urge I
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.920]   feel to start writing after I've carefully primed my cognitive maps and hippocampus.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.400]   It's more subtle.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.680]   It has more cognitive terroir.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.920]   It's connected to sort of images of yourself and your future.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.120]   It doesn't generate a huge discomfort that you need to relieve.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:27.040]   It's more easily ignorable, but the signal seems somehow more authentic.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.280]   Like it's getting to something more about your core self.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.600]   You have to just learn to be a connoisseur of that more subtle, nuanced, authentic
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.320]   feeling of motivation that comes for these long-term goals that you're pursuing.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.680]   And just get to really like that.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.840]   And really separate it from the discomfort of the much more short-term
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.000]   motivational system and be more comfortable, as we talked about before,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.800]   riding those waves of discomfort.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.920]   There's some subtlety there.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.280]   Anyways, all of this comes together to define what we mean by discipline.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.160]   Right?
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.840]   And it answers a lot of issues we have when we deal with these problems.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.000]   Like, let me just point out a few things here before we move on.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.520]   One, what I think is key about this example we used to structure this, is that
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.000]   there's two different things going on.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.600]   Resisting the short-term temptation and making the long-term
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.040]   valuable thing more meaningful.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.360]   We don't always break it up that way.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.520]   We don't always break it up that way.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:20.840]   Right?
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.000]   But these are two very different things that require different responses.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.320]   So if you ignore the short-term temptation, and that's derailing your
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.400]   attempts to do the long-term thing that's useful, the things you're going
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.120]   to do are never going to help with the short-term, if all you're doing is
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.320]   trying to work on your narrative of yourself and your life and what's
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.000]   important and you're getting these examples and you're getting motivated
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.200]   about these big grand things, none of that will affect your short-term
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.760]   motivational system, which could care less.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.600]   It doesn't talk to your prefrontal cortex.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.840]   It doesn't talk to your hippocampus.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.880]   It's boom, reward, let's rock and roll.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.080]   Right?
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.840]   So you have to deal with that completely differently.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.880]   On the other hand, if all you deal with is this sort of, why am I
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.080]   picking up my phone so much?
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.200]   Why am I drinking so much?
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.640]   Why am I playing video games so much?
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.680]   If all you're doing is trying to deal with those, you're left
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.040]   with a vacuum on the other side.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.640]   Because just not having those in your life doesn't automatically make the
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.320]   stuff that matters be more appealing.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.720]   Your brain still needs a good cognitive map for those things.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.400]   That takes time.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.680]   Your brain still needs lots of positive examples of this
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.120]   thing being executed properly.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.880]   That takes time and work to do.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.200]   So, you know, we, we often just focus on one piece or the other.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.960]   And that really, I think, prevents us from actually cultivating what
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.600]   we really mean by discipline, which is I'm consistently and happily
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.360]   making progress on the things that are hard in the moment, but value
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.440]   are valuable to me in the longterm.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:47.840]   It also, this more subtle approach also, I think really, uh, eliminates
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.920]   this idea that discipline is somehow a trait like your eye color.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.560]   Oh, you're disciplined or you're not disciplined.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.200]   Disciplined people, um, do the important stuff.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.320]   Non-disciplined people don't.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.880]   We're like, no, we're talking about brain systems that are subtle
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.800]   and you have to work with them.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.680]   And what makes someone more disciplined than someone else?
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.040]   It all has to do with what's going on with these brain systems.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.200]   Like maybe they have not built up through happenstance, like where they
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.960]   are, how they're raised, their personality.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.560]   They have less of the short-term distractions to have to combat.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.800]   Or maybe because of like who their parents were, what they were exposed
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.880]   to in college, they have these very rich cognitive maps, their hippocampus
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.600]   is stuffed full of positive examples.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.320]   And they don't find it hard at all to generate motivation for these
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.160]   long-term goals that have value.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.400]   Where someone else that has completely empty stores there, and they have to
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.280]   start from scratch, trying to build these things up.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.160]   Um, a lot of this is experience determined.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.000]   A lot of this is malleable.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.360]   Discipline is something you train.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.760]   It's not something that you're born with.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.440]   So anyways, hopefully that's useful.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.440]   Becoming more concrete here with in the weeds, what discipline might mean and
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.840]   giving us a, a fuller vision of how to hack it, uh, you know, we get a lot of
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.520]   questions about this, which we'll get to soon.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.480]   And I figured it might have made sense just to spend a little time getting into this.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.640]   So there you go, Jesse.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.280]   That's a, I say discipline 101, but maybe it's like discipline 505.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.440]   We've talked about it a lot.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.160]   There's a lot of layers to this topic, but hopefully that one made some sense.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.680]   I like the, uh, part one of, or the first point of part two, improving your cognitive map.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.760]   Uh, often forgotten by people, often overlooked.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.360]   You know, it's, this is the problem, by the way, with looking at someone who's far
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.040]   along in some sort of discipline, livelihood.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.880]   And if you're starting out, say, give me your advice.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.760]   It's the problem of your, if you're starting out writing books and you talk to like me,
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.400]   who is working on his ninth, you know, I have such a rich cognitive map.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.680]   I have a hippocampus stuffed full of these positive examples that what it takes for me
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.840]   to sit down and write is just a completely different subjective experience than the
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.600]   first time writer.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.160]   And this happens for almost every field.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.040]   It's, it's a, the problem, who you want to talk to is the person who just had their
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.600]   first success and try to understand what was it like, like right before they made
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.360]   progress for it.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.280]   Um, when you talk to the people who have already succeeded, you get money advice.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.440]   All right, well, we've got some good questions, uh, about this and related
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.160]   topics, but, uh, first Jesse, let's, uh, let's hear from some sponsors.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:27.920]   Look, uh, I love a great deal, as you know, as much as the next guy.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.120]   Um, but there's only so much I'm going to do to save some money, right?
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:37.440]   I mean, I'm not going to, for example, face my worst fears, like jumping into a
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.320]   cave of snakes or having to spend 20 minutes on Tik TOK.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.280]   Uh, I'm not going to do that just to save a few bucks, right?
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.520]   It has to be, it has to be pretty easy to do.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:52.760]   Um, this is why mint mobile catches my attention when they say it is easy to get
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.160]   wireless for only $15 a month with a purchase of a three month plan, they
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:03.960]   really mean it, it really is easy to get a wireless plan for just $15 a month.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.160]   Look, the longest part of this process is going to be actually the time required
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.640]   to break up with your old provider.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.200]   Getting the new coverage.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.160]   Couldn't be easier.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.280]   Um, here's how it works.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.120]   You go to mint mobile.com/deep.

[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.880]   See mint mobile for details.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   I am happy to say that this show is sponsored by green light.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.480]   Why am I happy?
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.560]   Because my family has been using this product for a while before green light
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:38.360]   even ever approached me about potentially being a sponsor, but here's the deal.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:44.120]   Green light is a debit card and money app for families where parents can keep an eye
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:50.480]   on kids' spending and money habits while kids learn how to save, invest, and spend
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:58.280]   wisely, uh, we got tired of having to keep track of allowance in cash for my three
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.120]   boys, or even worse, just sort of saying, oh, I guess we owe you this much
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.080]   allowance and buying things for them.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.360]   Uh, this gave us a way for them to gain some financial literacy.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.360]   Our oldest boys now have the debit card so they can actually go learn a little
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.440]   independence, go to the toy store down the street, spend their actual allowance
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.320]   on that card, not having someone do it for them, learn how to keep track of
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.960]   money, learn how to interact with people in stores with our oldest son.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.720]   We've also been helping him learn more about interest and even stock investing.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.400]   So we're big green light fans.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.120]   Uh, they have a new feature, the green light infinity plan for the, uh, your
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:42.880]   older kids, uh, your older kids, the green light infinity plan, which includes
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.400]   all the financial literacy education that makes green lights a valuable resource
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:50.160]   for millions of parents and kids for the older kids who have the green light app
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:55.000]   on their own phone, you can get these built in safety features such as the
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.360]   ability for teams to check in without needing to actually check in.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.080]   Thanks to family location sharing.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.720]   You have an SOS alert service in case there's an emergency, even a feature
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.600]   that would detect if they're in a car crash.

[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.560]   All right.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.840]   And with that, let's move on to questions.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.680]   Jesse, who's our first question from today.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.800]   Our first question is from Ranjit.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.760]   I am unemployed and have been studying web development.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.320]   I consider myself disciplined as I set aside two hours per day to look
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.840]   for a software engineering job.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.760]   However, I've not found anything yet.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.080]   Should I work harder?
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.280]   Well, uh, Ranjit, it's a good question and it lets me emphasize a point.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:22.040]   I've also been thinking about a lot recently, which discipline is not
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.120]   about energy expenditure in the abstract.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:34.680]   I think there is a sort of a strain of discipline being performed online
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:41.000]   right now that sort of just abstracts away the notion of hardness and there's
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.400]   a kind of a test of how much hardness can I, how much hardness can I take?
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.440]   Like, I think we, we see a lot of this happening with, um, cold plunging,
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.040]   right there, there's maybe some health benefits to cold plunging, but there's
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.240]   this other benefit of like, it's really hard and I can, you know, I can do it.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.320]   Um, we see this in sort of ultra endurance events.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.120]   You sort of imagine, uh, posting about, I didn't just run a marathon.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:04.840]   I ran 30 miles.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.680]   I ran 50 miles.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.640]   I ran the Leadville 100, right.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.040]   Just sort of just, um, abstracting difficulty.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.920]   Now there's not necessarily something wrong with that.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.520]   Um, it can be, for example, cognitive training for actual, more concrete
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.760]   goals that require discipline.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.120]   You can teach yourself through these types of endeavors that I am able to do
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.960]   things that are really hard that other people can't do, and that can be really
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.640]   important identity development.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.360]   It can be really important for preparing yourself to do, um,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.960]   actual, more specific goals.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.000]   But it's, I don't want you to mix up this more abstract notion of
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.080]   just difficulty equals discipline.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.000]   I don't want you to mix that up with.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.480]   Focus discipline, the discipline pursuit of things that are actually important.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.520]   And I think that might be what's happening here, right?
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.960]   You're spending hours doing this job searching, right?
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.120]   You're structured, you're disciplined.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.240]   I will sit here and do the job searching for hours every day, and
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.920]   it's not giving you what you need.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.280]   And it's because, uh, effort alone doesn't alchemize in the results.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.040]   It's specific effort aimed with evidence at specific goals that really matter.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.760]   So in this case, really what's going on is the search is not your problem.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.400]   Your problem is not, you're not searching enough.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.040]   Most people, when they're finding a new job, doesn't come
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.600]   after 150 hours of searching.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.040]   And it's all about, uh, how many, how fast can I do the
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.560]   searching or how many hours I can do?
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.440]   There's probably other things going on here.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.040]   The web development skills you have aren't quite right.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.000]   You need to push your skill level to the next level.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.760]   You're looking at the wrong types of jobs.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.880]   Um, so what you really need here is to interrogate the actions you're doing.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.480]   You have the ability to do hard things, but you need to interrogate
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.920]   the actions you're doing to make sure that you're doing the right ones.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.440]   We want to go back to the terminology of the deep dive.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.320]   We can talk about getting your cognitive map here a
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.480]   little bit more accurate.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.480]   All right.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.160]   So anyways, discipline for the sake of discipline, I treat with some wariness
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.360]   again, not because I think it's bad, but because it's not a replacement
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.920]   for actual focus discipline, where you have an evidence, evidence-based
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.360]   plan for what it is that you're applying that effort towards.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.560]   So I think that's your problem, Ranjit.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.760]   It's not time spent searching.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.520]   It's, uh, you need to really figure out why am I not getting these jobs?
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.640]   What skill am I missing?
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.480]   How could I get it?
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.320]   Is there a different type of job I should go for?
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.200]   Get a reality check on what's really going on in your world.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.320]   All right.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.080]   Who do we got next?
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.360]   Next question is from RJ.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.000]   I love the idea of the deep life stack.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.760]   I didn't know how long to spend in each layer.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.640]   So I devoted my entire quarter to developing discipline.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.720]   However, I ran into a conundrum after the quarter was over.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.080]   I did just okay.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.240]   I was able to sustain several weeks of performing the Keystone habits, but there
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:43.240]   were also some stretches of time where I wasn't, I was traveling, I had an injury.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.680]   I was busy at work, stuff like that.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:49.120]   Is there some objective metric I can use to determine when it's appropriate
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.400]   to move to the next layer?
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:55.440]   Well, RJ, as I've been working on this topic more, I tend to think about the
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:01.000]   deep life, but for the uninitiated, we mean here, creating an intentional life,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.480]   focusing on things that matter and minimizing things that don't.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.280]   I don't think about it as much anymore in a strict stack.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.360]   When you finish this layer, then do this layer, then do this layer.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.320]   I tend to think about it more now in three parts.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.880]   So the first part is preparation.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.200]   And that's where cultivating your discipline lies.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.480]   I also would put in there right now, getting organized, organizing your stuff
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.680]   and controlling your time.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.760]   I would also put in there, quieting your mind, right?
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:33.400]   One of the things I've learned working on this is becoming more comfortable with
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.760]   your own mind, spending time alone with your own thoughts, being good with just
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.960]   dealing with ideas and emotions.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.160]   This is really important as well for being able to later discern what's
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.480]   important to you and what's not and how to make progress in life.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.640]   Like that's all preparation.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.320]   Then you have a planning part.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.840]   How do you figure out what it is you should do to make your life deeper?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.440]   And here again, my big thought is don't work forward towards a big grand goal,
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.800]   but work backwards from a more general vision of an ideal lifestyle.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.120]   And then you have execution as the third part, like how do I actually move closer
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.560]   to this ideal lifestyle and the actual art of figuring out how to get from where
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.080]   you are here to where you want to go over there.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:18.120]   And here, like we talked about in the last question, evidence-based planning
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:24.120]   is really important, looking for a multi-factor results like this thing
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.400]   could help these three things.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.880]   You know, there's all sorts of complexities that come into planning.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.960]   These are roughly sequential, but they're not terminally sequential.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.920]   Like you need to start preparing before you plan.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.320]   You need to plan before you execute.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.720]   But even when you start planning, you still want to worry about the preparation.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.200]   And even when you're executing, you might go back and tweak your plan and
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.600]   then return back to the preparation.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:47.040]   All of these things are kind of going to be happening all together once you get
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:52.280]   going, which is all a way of saying your one quarter spent working on discipline
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.080]   is not enough to say, okay, now I have sufficient discipline to transform my
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:55.400]   life.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.520]   It doesn't mean you have to be stuck at just working on the preparation for
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.640]   multiple years, but it also means you can't just move on and not think about
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.800]   it anymore, right?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.560]   It's a ongoing process, working on your discipline, working on your
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.600]   organization and control, working on your quiet mind.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.760]   It's an ongoing process.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.640]   And I think for a lot of people who are new to this, it's probably going to be
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.600]   about a half year of working on those three things.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.840]   Start with the discipline, layer on some organization control, move on the quiet
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.880]   mind, and then keep going back and tweaking and fixing what's not working.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.320]   You need about six months of that before you would even move on to the next idea
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.640]   of like, okay, now let me start thinking about what I want to do in my life.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.680]   Um, and then even then you're going to return to the preparation, maybe every
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.040]   six months or so you're like, okay, where am I still lacking?
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.040]   Where are things getting loose?
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.240]   But you need at least six months, I think, preparing before you're ready to even
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.000]   sort of think about the next part of building a deep life.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.680]   So what you experienced is absolutely normal.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.440]   Yeah, you began working on discipline.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.960]   You used a keystone habit strategy where you just start practicing doing small,
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.640]   but important things in different parts of your life.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.400]   And it did okay.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.400]   And then it kind of fell apart.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:37:59.760]   Great.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   That's your first data point.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.480]   Now we evolve.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.720]   We fixed the metrics.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.080]   We get better at these circumstances that tripped you up.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.160]   What's your fallback protocol when you're sick?
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.280]   Do you have alternative versions of these metrics for when you're traveling?
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.920]   Maybe you do so that you can keep a discipline streak alive.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.120]   Even when you don't have access to the things at home, you need to do the
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.880]   keystone habits you originally chosen.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.680]   These are all data points for you to evolve your approach to discipline.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.400]   You also need to build probably off of the keystone habits as a starter towards
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.680]   now actually taking on at least one highly disciplined long-term project,
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.560]   maybe something involving fitness or physical health, those tend to work
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.800]   better, like you need to kind of up the game here a little bit.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.960]   If you're starting from scratch, it can really take a while until you've
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.240]   cultivated your discipline muscles to be strong enough that you're really
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.360]   ready for the stuff to follow.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:53.840]   So this is all to say, keep working on the preparation, be willing to do two
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.960]   or three major overhauls of what you're trying to try to find something that
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.360]   works.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.560]   And then even as you move on to the more fun stuff, your vision of your ideal
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.920]   lifestyle and making the, making the big moves, keep checking back in on those
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.240]   preparation stuff and say, where have I fallen off?
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.440]   What can I improve?
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.240]   What can I tweak?
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.120]   That's always going to be ongoing.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.040]   All right, who do we have next?
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.080]   Next question is from Liz.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.480]   My question is about cultivating a good relationship with tech during times of
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.120]   increased stress, in my case, lack of sleep.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.360]   After an evening shift, it is super difficult to stop picking my phone for
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.440]   that easy dopamine distraction.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.120]   All right, this is a good question.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:43.960]   There's a temptation here to say, look, you know, you're stressed, so it's okay.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.720]   You know, it's stressed.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.360]   It's okay.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:52.520]   Cause it's not really fair because other people just, it's not as stressed.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.960]   So it's going to be easier for them to work on other types of things.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.800]   But you're stressed.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.400]   That's okay.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.800]   You know, this is just harder for you.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.040]   I think the reality is like, it's, it's harder for you.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.880]   And that's, there's empathy there, but it's still really important.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:13.440]   It's still just as important that you work towards the same goal of making
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:18.280]   sure that behaviors that you don't think are important to you or behaviors that
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:23.920]   get in the way of things that are don't take over because once you have that
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.520]   strong connection, man, when I'm stressed, when I'm tired, I pick up that phone and
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.520]   it immediately gives me this sense of relief.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.840]   It is a really strong connection.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.560]   And other times when you're not stressed and you're not tired and you're trying
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.280]   to make progress on these other things that matter to you, you're not gonna be
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:43.760]   able to, because you have that strong connection that's been reinforced about
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.320]   the phone.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:48.600]   So, you know, the bad news is this is going to be harder for you.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.840]   Um, but the good news is, is that exactly the things we talked about in the first
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.960]   part of the deep dive still apply.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.400]   These are still the right ideas.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.680]   Reducing the stimuli, right?
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:58.960]   Okay.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.680]   It's just my, my phone is not around as much of taking the fun apps off of it.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.160]   That helps.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.440]   We know that's not enough.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.480]   How do we know that's not enough?
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.400]   Because in the full version of your question, we edited this for the episode,
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.120]   but in the full version of Liz's question, she talked about how she tries that, but
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.720]   she still goes and finds her phone.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:21.240]   Even if it's in the phone foyer method, uh, she uses Safari to search and get
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.720]   Instagram on the browser, even if she's taking the app off of it.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.640]   But that's why we had the other pieces of advice there as well.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.160]   Okay.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:31.680]   Now you need to build in the alternative rewards that when you're in similar
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.360]   stimuli situation that would normally lead you to pick up your phone, you have
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.280]   these other rewards.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.200]   You've trained yourself to crave that are triggered by the same stimuli.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.800]   You sort of swamp the stimulus that makes you pick up your phone with these other
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.200]   things.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:50.840]   And it could be whatever it's still like, I, I, you know, the run or the walk while
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.560]   listening to music that creates a chemical response is a good one.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.320]   The taking a book to the nearby coffee shop where you're around other people and
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.520]   you get the same herbal tea and like, whatever it is, right.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.880]   You, but you have this thing that you get this deeper reward out of, you get this
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.320]   and, and it's a similar stimuli.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.920]   You really get used to doing it.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.760]   Right.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:16.960]   Um, like I always now try to exercise at the end of my day between the end of my
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.600]   work day and the start of the evening.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.520]   Right.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.400]   Um, and now I have a lot of strong associations with that and it's, it gets
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.480]   lots of chemicals going and it really is physiologically active.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.760]   Um, and it, you know, it prevents me from just being like, Hey, let me just like,
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.240]   I don't know, eat snacks or veg or something like that.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.120]   So, so that one's going to be really important.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.440]   Um, and then of course, just a more subtle piece of advice there about getting more
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.720]   comfortable with the discomfort of resisting that stimuli.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.640]   But the key thing I'm going to point here is this white knuckling won't do it.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.920]   You have to have those alternatives that you're, you're putting in place instead.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:57.200]   So, uh, it's worth doing because again, life, once the phone and for other people,
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.880]   video games and for other people drinking, like once it becomes like what you do when
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.680]   you're at all bored or stressed, it really is like someone's draining a proverbial
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.160]   battery.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.640]   It's like, it's so hard to get away from.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.400]   And it just like makes your life gray.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.120]   It brings down these energy.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.240]   You're looking at these updates and social media.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.200]   Uh, and it just stops all this other stuff that over a long time, it's just going to
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.560]   make that life deeper, more interesting.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.200]   So it's really good that we're thinking about this.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.640]   All right, let's move on.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.520]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.640]   Okay.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.960]   Next question is from Paul in college.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.280]   I didn't use any social media.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.400]   It was very successful after college.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.920]   I moved to Dublin and I'm working in a tech company.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   However, I now feel very distracted for two reasons.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.160]   First, I always have to check my phone app to find an apartment.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.640]   Second, I started using dating apps and I'm hooked on those.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.600]   How can I regain control?
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.480]   I mean, let's think about this for a second.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.120]   Okay.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.120]   You used to not use social media and you were quote, very successful.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.320]   Now you're on your phone more and you're unhappy.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.400]   All right.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.840]   I mean, we got, we got a clear answer here.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.000]   Go back to where you were before, where you didn't use your phone
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:03.920]   that much for these things.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:10.120]   Now that the issue here, and this is like a common reaction I get, uh, this
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.240]   is the using the, the molehill.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.600]   And I'm trying to think this on, on the fly here, Jesse, but like transforming
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.640]   the molehill into the mountain.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.680]   So what you're saying is like, oh, there are these incredibly narrow reasons.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.120]   I feel like I need to use my phone searching for an apartment
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.720]   and being on a dating app.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:33.400]   And because of that, I use my phone all the time now, but that's crazy.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:38.800]   Look, do 20 minutes a day during your lunch hour on your laptop, not on your
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.400]   phone, uh, look at what apartments have come available.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.680]   Look at what responses you've got to your dating app.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:49.080]   That is all the time it could possibly take in the world on a day-to-day basis.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.920]   How many apartments become available throughout the day?
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:56.320]   How many people have responded to your dating profile throughout the day?
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.280]   Like 20 minutes a day during lunch on your laptop, you can be looking for what
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.560]   apartments are new and that anyone respond to my dating app response, and then you
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.160]   can still maintain what you had before.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.680]   Just go back to what you had before.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.800]   I don't really use my phone.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   You're in a good situation here, Paul, because it's not like you're decoding a
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.600]   behavior and going to a new behavior.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.840]   You've never been to before.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.840]   You're going back to where you were before.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.720]   So your brain knows and has great memories of what life was like when you
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.840]   didn't use your phone all the time.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.040]   So all you have to tell your brain to do is like, that's what we're going back to.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.400]   Let me just take this two stimuli that are messing me up, the dating app and the
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.120]   apartment app, and let me just constrain that to my laptop at lunch.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:32.800]   All right.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.640]   With that out of the way, it won't be too hard to go back to where you were before.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:42.600]   So don't let the molehill of like, I have this digital stuff I need to do become
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.280]   the mountain of, I have to be on my phone all the time, right?
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:52.000]   We talked about this last week when we were reading common objections to the
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.400]   idea that younger kids should not use smartphones.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:59.120]   And one of the common objections was like, well, there's this one thing I
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:04.240]   sometimes need to do, you know, get access to my kid occasionally because like the
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.880]   plan changed and they need to not take the bus.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.320]   I need to tell me if they missed the bus and need to get picked up or something.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.760]   And they went from that immediately to, therefore they should be on TikTok in
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.720]   their room at two in the morning.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:23.040]   Like we can't let these small digital necessities become a skeleton key to
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.800]   bringing unrestricted technology into our lives.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.600]   And I think this is a great example of that.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.360]   All right.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.560]   So Paul, you're in good shape though, because you already know what it's like
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:31.600]   not to use your phone all the time.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.840]   Let's just get you back there.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.160]   All right.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:34.880]   What do we have next?
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.560]   Next question is from Ron.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.320]   I notice in the El Pais article that Cal's home desk didn't have a large desktop
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:42.840]   monitor.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.040]   I have both a laptop and a desktop.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.360]   I use my desktop as my main computer and my laptop when portability is needed.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.360]   It occurred to me recently that sitting down at a desk right in front of a massive
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.200]   screen kind of sets me up to go first to the screen.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:00.800]   Temptations to news sites, email, or even the vast labyrinth of my own files and
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.320]   folders.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.240]   Does Cal only use a laptop?
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.280]   Well, first of all, we should.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.080]   I don't know if we talked, we talked about this article, right?
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.800]   Let me load it up though.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.760]   We haven't, I can, I have it here.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:20.200]   So I'm going to load it up for those who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.000]   So this was a profile that I want to show you the desk he's talking about.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.840]   All right.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.840]   So let me load this up.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.880]   All right.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:34.200]   So this was a profile in a newspaper in Spain about me.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.280]   And so it has this picture.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.480]   So for those who haven't seen it, this is a picture of me for those who are
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:43.920]   watching at my office, my library, at my house.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.000]   Okay.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.040]   And as, as you can see, and as was pointed out in this question, that there is no
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:55.640]   monitor on this desk, the nice desk is custom made desk from Houston and company
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.920]   in Maine that does actually university library desk primarily.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.040]   So it's kind of my, my mini library desk.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:01.720]   All right.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.880]   So this is what the question is about.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.680]   Um, as long as we have this loaded up though, we might as well show the real,
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:13.720]   the real star of this article quick aside is there's been the studio that, uh, for
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:17.280]   those who haven't seen Jesse skeleton has featured in this article.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.880]   There you go.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.760]   I don't know why they thought this was important.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.160]   I love the matter.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.280]   By the way, Jesse, I love this matter of fact, caption, a corner
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.640]   of Newport's recording studio.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.720]   The skeleton is named Jesse after Jesse Miller, the producer of Newport's
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.240]   podcast, no other explanation, just like a supernatural, like, yeah.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:41.320]   So like, here's a skeleton, uh, the number, this capture writer was thinking,
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:45.920]   okay, here's the number one question someone will have when they see that
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.760]   this author has a skeleton, a literal skeleton in the recording studio that
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:54.320]   most people's question will be, oh, but where did it get to its name from?
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.640]   Like, that's the question you have.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:58.440]   Skeleton.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.160]   We have skeletons.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:48:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.760]   But, but, but where is the skeleton's name from?
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.560]   I just think it was funny, but anyways, okay.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.840]   Uh, back to, back to my office.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.440]   So why don't I have a monitor on this desk?
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.640]   Um, an important thing about this library and here I'll turn off the sharing here.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.280]   An important thing about this library is, uh, no permanent electronics.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.920]   So I didn't want a permanent computer in there.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:27.040]   There's no printer in there, no scanner in there, no big monitor in there.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.520]   Cause I really wanted to cognitively associate this space
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.280]   with, uh, thinking and writing.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:38.560]   And there's other things I associate with admin tasks, printing out
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.120]   bills, doing the budget, et cetera.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.520]   It's like, I did not make that into a home office.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.120]   It's a library it's for, for thinking and writing.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:48.320]   When I write in there, I bring in my laptop and I write on my laptop,
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.480]   but it's not in there permanently.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.840]   Now I also like screens.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.000]   They're useful, but I have different spaces.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.480]   So upstairs in my house is a small, smaller sort of like cubby annex
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.840]   where we have our home office.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.080]   That's where my filing cabinets are.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.520]   That's where the printer is.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.640]   That's where the scanner is.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.840]   That's where the color printer is.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.400]   There is a big monitor there that I can plug my laptop into.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.160]   That's where I do the budget.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.400]   That's where I do taxes.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.920]   That's where paperwork happens.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:19.440]   That's where, um, we sign medical and scan medical forms
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.400]   to send back for our kids camps.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.880]   Uh, I'll, I'll tell you, Jesse, the rough estimate of the number of
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:31.040]   forms you have to send to a camp about medical issues related to your child.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.320]   And this is a rough estimate is somewhere around a
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.520]   hundred thousand pieces of paper.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.980]   I don't know.
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:39.040]   I don't know what, uh, times three for three kids.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.280]   You would think when you were sending your kid to a summer camp in the
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:48.280]   Washington DC area that, uh, they were probably also going to be a
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.280]   part of a NASA mission to the moon.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:57.080]   It is a similar level of medical documentation between the original
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:04.080]   Apollo astronauts and fifth graders going to a day camp in Washington, DC.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:04.680]   It's crazy.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.840]   The amount of paperwork you need to have.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.720]   I don't want that mind space to be activated when I'm
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:11.880]   writing a New Yorker article.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:16.280]   So in the place where I write, uh, I don't have permanent electronics.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.040]   Now at the HQ where you are right now, Jesse, as you know, there, we
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.120]   got a real beastie setup where we have two big monitors on a movable arms
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.960]   and a really powerful Mac studio computer.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.720]   And so I'll often go there if I, if I'm doing some part of writing where, um,
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.880]   I really want a lot, I need a lot of sources open more so than just a single
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.080]   Scrivener double pane on my laptop.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:38.680]   Uh, you know, I'm editing and I need a bunch of sources open or something.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:42.120]   Sometimes I'll go there and use our giant sort of spaceship
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.880]   cockpit setup we have at the HQ.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.720]   But the library is for really like the most thinking, reading,
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.000]   thinking, hard craft typewriting.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.920]   So it's a good question because that's very much on purpose that there's no
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.440]   screen in that room.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.360]   I thought a lot about that.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.240]   All right.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.520]   We should get a copy of, I want a copy of that Jesse skeleton picture.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.600]   We should, we should have got that paper from the reporter.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.640]   We could have framed it for the HQ.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.320]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.280]   All right.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.720]   Uh, Oh, our next question is our slow productivity corner question.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.800]   So let's get some theme music.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:25.480]   So for those who are new, the slow productivity corner, that's where
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:30.760]   we pick a question each week that is related to my new book, slow
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.560]   productivity, the last start of accomplishment without burnout.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.800]   If you like the show, you need that book, right?
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.480]   That book is like the, the handbook or the source guide for
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.160]   so many ideas we talk about.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.240]   Um, you know, I'm really proud of it.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.440]   We reference it all the time.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.200]   So slow productivity, you should check out that book if you have not already.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:50.840]   All right.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.480]   So we have a question here that's related to the book, Jesse, let's hear it.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.520]   Questions from Joe Vita.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:00.720]   How can somebody who is just starting a professional knowledge career apply the
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:04.520]   slow productivity principles as they start their new job?
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.520]   How can I initially avoid falling into a pseudo productivity trap without
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.720]   appearing lazy and unmotivated?
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.560]   That's a good question, Javita, because when you're very new to a job, you're
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:19.680]   not going to, for example, make tons of proclamations about the complex systems
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.920]   that you're running and explain to everyone why what they're doing is wrong
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.360]   and how you're going to be super productive.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:29.360]   You kind of have to earn your keep a little bit, but as you point out, if you
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.120]   fall into the trap of pseudo productivity, that is using visible effort as your
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.160]   main proxy for you being useful, you may never actually escape that trap.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:41.320]   So how do we bootstrap this whole slow productivity mindset when you're
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.480]   new to a job?
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:46.680]   Well, I'm going to have you focus at first on workload, right?
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.040]   Principle one of that book is do fewer things.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.360]   Once you have too many things you're actively working on, the administrative
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:57.320]   overhead of these tasks pile up to the point where you spiral into administrative
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:01.480]   overload and most of your day is now spent tending work.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.200]   You don't have much time to actually do the work.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:03.920]   You fall behind.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.720]   Equality gets lower.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.080]   It's very hard to escape that trap.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:10.320]   So we do not want you in this new job, the fall into the overload that's
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.240]   generated by having too many things on your plate at the same time.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:19.280]   We also have to, as quickly as possible, establish your reputation with your
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.080]   colleagues and bosses as someone who has organized and get things done.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:27.480]   This is going to gain you quite a bit of flexibility in how
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.560]   you approach your workload.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:34.360]   If they know you have your act together, they trust your decisions about what
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.000]   you're going to take on or how long it's going to take.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.600]   So how do we accomplish both of those goals at the same time?
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.400]   I'm going to focus in on one particular piece of advice from the book
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.000]   and suggest that you start with it.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.480]   This is the advice of pre-scheduling time for every major commitment
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.760]   you are going to agree to.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:56.800]   So you're, you're considering, your boss asks you to do a particular project.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.720]   It's going to take more than just, you know, 20 minutes.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.640]   Find the time to do it on your calendar, put on your calendar, like a meeting,
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.440]   you know, like you have to estimate and be conservative about it, but like, yeah,
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:11.000]   this is going to take like three major sessions probably, uh, to write this
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.760]   thing and then a meeting and then like another major session to edit, go find
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.640]   that time and block it out on your calendar.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.680]   There's a lot of advantages to this.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:26.280]   Number one, uh, it is going to prevent you from getting overloaded because
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.160]   you're literally putting the time aside for what you're going to do.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.080]   You can't overload yourself because everything you have to do has
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.600]   to find free time in the calendar.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.520]   So if you have too many things for the time you have the next week or two, you
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.720]   just can't fit those things onto your calendar and you get this really clear
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.640]   signal coming back.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.400]   Oh, I can't, this is how long it's going to take.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.600]   I don't have time for this.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.280]   It doesn't fit in my calendar for another three weeks.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.520]   Okay.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.760]   So if I take this on, I can tell you it'll be three weeks till it's done.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:58.760]   So it just prevents you almost, uh, literally makes overload impossible.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:05.360]   Two, it allows you to prove that you're reliable because you've scheduled
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.560]   the time in advance for when things are going to be done.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.240]   You know, when they're going to be done.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.000]   So tell them that, and then deliver.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.400]   That's like magic in the knowledge work world.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.840]   When you say, yeah, boss, I'm on this.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:20.760]   I'll get this to you, uh, by Tuesday.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:23.160]   And then on Tuesday, you deliver it.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.280]   Repeat that by four or five times.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.960]   Now you have earned your reputation as someone who has their
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.520]   act together and is organized.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.560]   So now when they say, well, can you do this?
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.040]   And you realize you can't get it done really in a reasonable
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.680]   fashion for another six weeks or so.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.360]   You will get the leeway.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:41.360]   Like, yeah, I can get it done, but I, you know, you know, me, I'm very organized
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:44.280]   and I, I allocate my time for everything I'm working on.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.400]   There's not really enough time to get this done.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.040]   Uh, it'll be about six weeks.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.280]   Now you have more flexibility to do that.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.320]   So it's like a flywheel.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.080]   It's like a self-reinforcing flywheel.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:57.160]   Also, when you're explicitly scheduling your time, it allows you to turn a
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.000]   knob because you can decide how much time you want to schedule.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.440]   Now, this is really important because early on in your job, the other thing
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.280]   you can do that's vital is start to master a skill that's going
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.320]   to move you to the next level.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:13.840]   You want to become as valuable as possible to this company so that
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:15.040]   they really don't want to lose you.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.800]   And when they're desperate not to lose you, they will accommodate
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.120]   almost anything you suggest.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.920]   Including many of the other ideas from slow productivity.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.520]   Well, if you're pre-scheduling your time, you can pre-schedule first
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.920]   time for working on new skills.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.480]   Right?
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.760]   Because like that's on my calendar.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.760]   So when I'm trying to make these other projects fit, it
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.720]   has to find other time.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:32.880]   Right?
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.040]   So you can turn these knobs about how much time am I working on work?
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.600]   How much time am I working on new skills?
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.160]   And you control all of this.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:42.040]   And it's also much better than just being in the list reactive mode.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.840]   We have a to-do list of stuff you're supposed to do that you try to make
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.160]   progress on while reacting to stuff that's coming on inbound.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.840]   So Jovita, that's how I would get started.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:54.040]   Long-term, you're not going to want to schedule everything out in advance.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.880]   This can become pretty burdensome after a while.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:02.360]   Long-term, I would suggest once you've built your reputation, you've made
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:06.360]   yourself valuable to the company, probably using something like a pull-based
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.720]   workload system is going to be more sustainable in the future, as opposed
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.400]   to trying to put everything on the calendar.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:15.400]   And so you can move onwards to a more sophisticated implementation
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.640]   of slow productivity, but use pre-scheduled time commitments for your
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.840]   work for the first like six months of a new knowledge work job.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.120]   I really think there's a huge number of benefits to exactly that piece of advice.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.280]   Um, so if you buy the book, slow productivity, focus in on principle
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:35.520]   one, that's chapter three, which has principle one, that's going to have the,
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.280]   the details of what we were just talking about.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.960]   All right, Jesse, I think it's a good excuse to hear that slow productivity
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.840]   corner theme music one more time.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:53.480]   All right, now I want to do a case study.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.080]   This is where someone will send in an account of putting into action, the
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.720]   type of advice we talked about here on the show.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:03.920]   So we can see what it looks like out in the real world, right?
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.680]   Today's case study is anonymous, but it's a good one.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:07.440]   So here's what it says.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:11.320]   I taught for 14 years in a middle school classroom.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:16.400]   This past year, I started a new role as an instructional coach, my job duties
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:20.480]   shifted, and I worked on multiple projects at the start of the year.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:24.880]   I knew I would need a system to maintain, organize, reduce distractions
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.200]   and stay on top of my workload.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.120]   My new office was located in a shared suite with tons of foot traffic.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:34.560]   I use principles from deep work, and I also bought a time block planner
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:38.720]   weekly planning and using time blocking gave me a clear long-term view of what
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.360]   needs to be accomplished every week and month and added benefit was that
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.000]   throughout the year, I was able to avoid bringing work home, which was
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.040]   great as I have two young daughters.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.680]   Initially, I found myself blocking off more time than needed to complete
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.680]   most tasks other than scheduled meetings.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.120]   Then the opposite happened.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:57.640]   I didn't plan enough time and tasks took longer than expected.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.640]   Over time, my estimates improved.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.400]   I think one of the most underappreciated aspects of time block
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.120]   planning was the ideas list.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.480]   In the past, when an idea popped up, I would delay my work
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.560]   and go down a rabbit hole.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.920]   Next year, our district funding has shifted and my current
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.360]   position has been eliminated.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.440]   So I'll be going back to the classroom.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.440]   Each day, I'll have four teaching blocks and two prep box.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.720]   Each prep block will be 53 minutes.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.600]   Uh, how can I be productive during these short time blocks?
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.840]   They seem like sprint sessions compared with what I had this past year.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.320]   All right.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.720]   It's a great case study that also has a hidden question.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.640]   The key principle being shown in this case study is multiscale planning.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.040]   This is the power of, uh, having a bigger picture plan for like
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.440]   the quarter or the semester.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.680]   Using that to inform a weekly plan.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:41.960]   Okay.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.400]   What's on my calendar this week?
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.720]   What am I going to make progress on the important things?
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.080]   What things are I gonna make progress on?
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.000]   How am I going to fit my work into this week?
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.840]   And then using a daily time block plan on the daily schedule to make the
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:58.400]   most of the time you have and also have clear shutoffs, uh, our respondent
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:03.120]   here, correspondent here use multiscale planning in their office job, and we
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.040]   could see how well, uh, that worked out.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.120]   All right.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.080]   So now there's a hidden question is okay.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:13.160]   Now, uh, he or she has to go back to teaching and is worried about being
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.720]   productive during the short prep blocks.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.640]   Um, it's interesting because it's like in this teaching role, you have some
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.480]   time block planning that's already automatically happening, your teaching
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.640]   block and your prep blocks.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:30.760]   Some of the things that are going to matter here is going to be, uh, being.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.760]   Pretty process oriented.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.080]   Like what, what do I want to do during this prep walks?
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.560]   What's the most effective way to do it?
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.640]   And two, like we talk about often with teachers, um, be very careful about
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.320]   extra sort of non-compensated duties.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.240]   Typically you do not have enough time to do more than like your bare bones
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.880]   teaching job without having to add extra time.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.760]   So be very careful about taking on anything else.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.320]   Be very jealous about your time.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.000]   Um, you're going to need some blocks outside of the student day, but you
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.240]   gotta just, it's about making the most out of that time, having great processes
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.400]   and systems, knowing exactly how you prep, how you grade, where you store
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.960]   the information, no wasted time.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.600]   Um, if you can have office hours with your parents, that's great.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.400]   One of my son's teachers did it this year, which I thought was great.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:18.640]   Instead of just like email me anytime it was these hours on these days, call me.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.880]   So things you can do that makes you less reactive and more proactive and control
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.320]   your time, that will all matter as well.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.440]   But mainly I appreciate this case study of multi-scale planning in a sort of
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.800]   standard type of office job, really doing, making a big difference.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.920]   It really is one of the core ideas on this show.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.600]   Uh, if you have a non-entry level, semi-complex knowledge work job,
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.600]   you have to multi-scale plan.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600]   It's night and day.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:46.120]   It's the difference between chaos, busyness, and stress and being
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.440]   able to see over the horizon.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.120]   And with some confidence, sort of aim your proverbial
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.280]   boat in the right direction.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.680]   All right.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.600]   Well, we have a cool final segment coming up here, but first I want
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.000]   to hear from another sponsor.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.840]   So let's talk about our longtime friends here at Roan.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.360]   Look, men's closets were due for a radical reinvention and Roan has stepped
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.680]   up to this challenge with their commuter collection, the most comfortable,
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.080]   breathable, and flexible set of products known to man, right?
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.520]   Here's why, uh, they have a product for every occasion.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.320]   Like, so the commuter collection is going to have pants.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.440]   It's going to have dress shirts.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.440]   It's going to have quarter zips.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.760]   It's going to have polos, right?
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.440]   So you never have to worry what you're going to wear when you have
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.680]   the Roan commuter collection.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.280]   It's very comfortable clothes.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.400]   I can say this from direct experience, four-way stretch fabric, it's
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:43.480]   breathable, it's flexible, uh, you don't overheat in it, it whisks moisture away.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.160]   When I have like a hard day at a conference or I'm teaching all day and
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:52.880]   it's hot, this is the really comfortable type of dress wear that I really enjoy.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.600]   Uh, if you're traveling, it has wrinkle release technology.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.600]   As you wear it, the wrinkles disappear.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.040]   So you can throw on, I've done this before the Roan commuter collection
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.800]   dress shirt, you know, to go give a talk or do some conference settings.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.960]   It was in your bag.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.080]   It's not going to be wrinkled.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.920]   It's going to be comfortable all day long.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.560]   Uh, it has gold fusion, anti-odor technology as well.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.480]   So you'll be smelling fresh and clean all day long.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:19.280]   Um, on top of that, it's a hundred percent machine washable to forget the dry cleaner.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.200]   So the stuff in the washing machine, you're ready to go.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.080]   Uh, it's fantastic stuff.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.600]   So the commuter collection can get you through any workday and
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.120]   straight into whatever comes next.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:35.560]   Head to Roan.com/Cal and use the promo code Cal to save 20% off your entire order.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.640]   That's 20% off.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.120]   That's non-trivial guys, 20% off your entire order.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:46.720]   When you head to Roan.com/Cal and use that code Cal it's time to
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.360]   find your corner office comfort.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.200]   I also want to talk about our long-time friends and sponsor Blinkist.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:05:00.440]   Blinkist is an app that gives you more than 6,500 book summaries and expert
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:06.120]   led audio guides, each of which you can read or listen to in just 15 minutes
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:11.040]   or less, you can access best in class, actionable knowledge from 27 categories,
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:18.760]   such as productivity, psychology, and more on to go and be entertained at the same time.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.520]   There's a lot of ways to use Blinkist.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.280]   The way Jesse and I use it is to help triage books.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.880]   We want to read for interested in a book.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:31.520]   We will, uh, either read or listen to the blink for that book,
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.440]   the summary of its main ideas.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.520]   And it really does a good job of telling us.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.800]   Oh, this is what I thought it was, or this is intriguing.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.760]   I want to go buy the book and read the whole thing.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.200]   Or yeah, I think I know what I need to know from this blink.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.200]   I'm not going to waste my time actually purchasing the book.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.080]   So it's one of many uses for Blinkist is to be a triage tool.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.480]   If you embrace the reading life, uh, they also have a cool feature right
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.680]   now called Blinkist connect, which allows you to give another person
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.600]   unlimited access to Blinkist for free.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.920]   So it's basically a two for one, uh, deal.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.800]   All right.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.560]   So I think that's pretty cool.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.840]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.

[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:37.480]   So you will be getting two premium subscriptions for the price of one.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.240]   All right, Jesse, let's get to our final segment.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.840]   All right.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.800]   So I'm going to call this final segment battle of the sheds.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:53.200]   So if you are a subscriber to my newsletter, and if you're not,
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.000]   you should go to calnewport.com to sign up.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.840]   I have, I don't know what it is now, over a hundred thousand subscribers
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.840]   now who get my semi-regular dispatches about trying to cultivate a deep life.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.800]   Um, you will have noticed as a newsletter subscriber that in the,
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.080]   the last, uh, two weeks or while I've been up here, let's say while I've
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:15.080]   been up here on vacation, I've been publishing these dispatches from being
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:18.720]   up North and trying to go deep and right.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:25.080]   Anyways, uh, one of these dispatches, I showed the writing shed on my
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.720]   property up here where I've been writing.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:32.720]   And in the next dispatch, I went to Arrowhead, the farmhouse bought
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:39.880]   by Herman Melville in 1850, where he wrote Moby Dick among other famous books.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:45.480]   And I want to compare where I've been writing with where he's been writing.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.120]   I've got visual aids here.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.280]   Let me load this up.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.080]   I'm going to share my screen.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:53.440]   So for those who are listening, instead of watching, you can see this directly.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.880]   Uh, what we have on the screen here is a scene of the writing
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.880]   shed where I've been working.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.520]   So there's a scene here from the outside.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:05.680]   Uh, you can see the hose, the hose, the pipe coming out of here, which is
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.080]   the exhaust for the wood-burning stove.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.720]   There is a scene from inside of this writing shed.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.640]   Beautiful view of the Taconic mountains.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.080]   Mount Equinox, uh, is in the far distance there.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.560]   There's a nice table here I've been writing at.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.200]   There's a light, there's a fan to move the air around.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.280]   Um, I've been getting some pretty good writing done here.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.560]   I've been working on my deep life book.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.760]   I wrote these two dispatches and have, have, uh, been doing
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.040]   some New Yorker work as well.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.320]   All right.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:40.800]   About 50 minutes Southeast of here is the farm where Herman Melville did his writing.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.800]   So here's a picture of his writing shed.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.200]   This is actually not really a shed.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.760]   It's the second floor of his house.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.200]   He took this premium room, uh, has a dining table here.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:56.480]   That view out the window there is of, you can see it in this picture here.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.680]   I took this, these are my pictures.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.360]   I took while I went to visit recently.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.640]   Mount Greylock, which would have been called Saddleback Mountain back then.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.560]   He was enamored by the view of this mountain.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.960]   That row of trees you see, so you have to look closely to see the mountain,
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.800]   but you see the darker shape there.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.120]   That row of trees was not there in the 1850s.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.440]   I confirmed this with the docent.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.480]   It was, these were more plowed fields.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.400]   So you had a direct view of the mountain.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.080]   That was his inspiration.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.160]   That's what he stared at while he was writing Moby Dick.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.480]   He bought this farm in part because of that mountain view.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.000]   His uncle Thomas had a farm right next to this, that all throughout his
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.440]   childhood and young adulthood, he would visit every summer and he loved the view.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.280]   And then his uncle said, I'm going to sell it.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.240]   And Herman was like, this is really sad.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:44.240]   But then the neighbors of his uncle Thomas, the Brewster said, well,
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.640]   we're selling our farm too.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.560]   And on an impulse Melville bought it.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.040]   He's like, I want to read here.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.000]   He also built a Piazza, which he writes about famously in a short story, but he
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.560]   built a Piazza on the house on this side of the house so he could sit outside
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.360]   and look at the mountain.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:03.480]   And, uh, I was talking to the young woman who was working in the gift shop.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:04.920]   At Arrowhead.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:09.920]   And she said he had built it small enough that it was comfortable for him.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:15.000]   But if you were visiting, you wouldn't feel like you should sit and talk to him.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.240]   He didn't want people to bother him.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.520]   So he built it small enough.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.120]   So he's like, no, this is not a visiting porch.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.760]   This is like a me sitting here thinking porch, uh, which I really appreciate.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.160]   So here's our dueling sheds, Jesse.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.480]   This is my writing shed.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.240]   There's Melville's.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.600]   All right.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.640]   Uh, you can be the judge here.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.960]   How are we going to judge this?
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.880]   Who's a exotic writing location wins.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:44.600]   Well, they're somewhat similar because they're in similar
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.480]   geographic locations, right?
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.360]   They are very similar.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.160]   Uh, they're looking at, I'm looking at the iconic mountains.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.520]   He's looking at the Berkshire mountains, but it is very similar.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.720]   We both have a good space.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.880]   Uh, here's some criteria.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.920]   It depends on your criteria.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.680]   His would been noisier because it's in his house and his house
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.320]   is built around a central chimney.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.400]   So the rooms are in a ring and they're all just connected to each other.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.800]   So that you have to go through the rooms to get out.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.000]   Now, I think it would go the other way, but it was noisy.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.560]   They had a lot of people living in that house.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.400]   Uh, so that's a point for me, a point for him.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.640]   It's just looking at the outcome.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:29.880]   So, you know, in my writing shed, uh, I wrote a chapter of my, you
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:33.560]   know, pragmatic nonfiction book in his writing shed, he wrote Moby Dick.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.120]   So we, we got this, we got this sort of trade-off here.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.640]   I think mine is quieter.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.840]   Uh, I think his has a better track record.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.920]   So maybe I guess we just have to call it a draw.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.720]   Yep.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.680]   Uh, that's one of the reasons I love this area I'm in though, is because
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.960]   especially like the Berkshires, but also Southern Vermont has this great
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.680]   literary heritage of people who wrote up here, right?
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.040]   So if you go to Southern Vermont, so just start going North from the Berkshires,
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.840]   right, uh, go up route, historic route seven, a on the way towards Manchester.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.200]   Right.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:10.880]   What do you come across Robert Frost's farm where he wrote, uh, won his first
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.360]   Pulitzer prize and wrote his famous poem about going through a walk in the winter
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.400]   woods, uh, that's all up here.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.360]   Um, continue up farther North in Vermont, go to the Champlain Valley, take the
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.240]   pass over to the Mad River Valley.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.960]   I don't know if this is the Lincoln pass or the other one.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:30.920]   You get to the town of Ripton home to, uh, environmentalist, Bill McKibben.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:35.040]   You get another Robert Frost farm where he went for the last 20 years of his
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.200]   life to just sit on this high elevation farm.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.400]   Now, interestingly, as I just discovered from my brother-in-law's
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.440]   staying up there this summer, it's where, uh, Ripton is also where.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.360]   Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard have a house.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.280]   So there you go.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.400]   They keep running into them.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:56.800]   Anyways, it's cool around here because there is this history of writers coming.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.520]   They use the environment to help get better thoughts out of their heads.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.800]   And so there's a, there's sort of an inspiration to it, the
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.280]   anti-inspiration of Melville.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.640]   So maybe this gives us another nod back to my shed is he, he, uh, financially
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.080]   failed as a writer there and had to.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.880]   Abandon the farm under too much debt and go back and get a desk job
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.240]   as a custom inspector in the city.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.400]   Oh, really?
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:18.800]   It was interesting.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:24.520]   Um, not to go too far on this, but he wrote these books before he bought the
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.120]   farm that no one except for Melville fans know about or remember they were
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.800]   eventually, I mean, essentially adventure novels, right?
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:38.480]   He had been on this like Epic five-year journey as a sailor where he was on a
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:44.760]   whaling ship, he deserted the whaling ship in the Pacific somewhere, got on
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:50.440]   another whaling ship, just as they had a mutiny put in jail, got out of jail,
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:55.960]   made his way to Hawaii, was a farmer in Hawaii for a while, got on a Navy ship.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.520]   Five years later, makes it back.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:01.960]   So he writes these sort of 19th century adventure novels that draws from his
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.840]   knowledge of these exotic places in the Pacific.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.640]   And they're like blockbusters, right?
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.400]   They're like, this is great.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.040]   This is a really fun.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:10.760]   So he's thinking, I'm just going to be able to keep being a successful writer.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.840]   So great.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.640]   We'll buy this farm.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.600]   He borrows money from his father-in-law buys this farm.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.520]   He's like, yeah, I'm going to sit here.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.360]   He had these plans.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.720]   I learned from the docent to like rip down the house and build
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.240]   a new house with a writing tower.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.560]   He was going to sit in his writing tower and like, this was going to be his life.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:29.240]   The problem is, is he's hanging out now with, uh, Hawthorne and, um, other
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:33.440]   writers of this sort of mid 19th century, new England intellectual explosion.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.280]   And he's exposed to all this like really smart stuff.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.000]   And so the S the stuff he starts writing, it's like Moby Dick and et
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.160]   cetera, is not an accessible adventure novel, but is this like psychologically
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.560]   realist, proto modern type writing that no one had seen before.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.160]   No one knew what to do with it.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.520]   Like what, what the hell are you doing?
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.560]   What is this book?
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:58.920]   It's like kind of about whaling and it's like a science book, but also it's a
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.920]   novel and we're, we're going inside the character's head.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.680]   Like, what is this?
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:02.880]   Right.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.680]   And no one knew what to do with those books.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.560]   They got terrible reviews and he just lived off of borrowed money from his
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.400]   father-in-law, got depressed.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.800]   And they were eventually like, you can't just live out here on this farm.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.280]   You need to go back and just like get a job.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:19.360]   It wasn't until the 1920s that people were like, oh, Melville is a genius.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.240]   Because by then, uh, our sensibilities had evolved.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.280]   Modernism had come around.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.840]   We're like, oh my God, these guys were early to it.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.360]   It's like going back to Van Gogh and people realize like, oh,
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.560]   Van Gogh was onto something.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.000]   But at the time they thought he was crazy and he cut off his ear.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.560]   So this is a kind of interesting story about, he wasn't appreciated.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:40.040]   So he did this great work there, but didn't really get to enjoy
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.800]   the rewards of that, that work.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.880]   So, so hopefully, hopefully I'll have a more direct rewards in my lifetime
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.960]   for my writing in my shed than the Melville had.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.400]   But it's cool up here.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:54.240]   He died, he was, um, he was older.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.480]   I mean, he made it to his seventies, maybe.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.280]   But like what year?
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.840]   That would have been, I don't know, probably like he moved out of the, he
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.240]   moved out of Arrowhead, I think in 1863.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:07.880]   Okay.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.520]   And he would have been.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.120]   I don't know, 45, 50, 45, 50.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.640]   So he probably lived.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:19.240]   So probably like the 1870s or 1880s, maybe like the early 1890s.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.400]   He's buried in New York.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.440]   So anyways, there you go.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.680]   Battle of the writing sheds.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:29.160]   The key lesson there, of course, is just where you do creative work can be as
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.040]   important as what work you actually do.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.360]   Which is my way of saying, I'm sad that I will be leaving this beautiful
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.880]   surroundings soon and heading back to DC, but I'm excited to get back to the HQ,
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:45.240]   get back to some, uh, some new action as the new school year comes along.
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:47.880]   So it'll be sad to leave here, Jesse, but it'll be great to be
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.440]   back with you in the studio.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:53.320]   So for everyone else, that's all the time we have for today, but we'll be back next
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.440]   week with the old fashioned in-studio episode.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.560]   I'm looking forward to it.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.240]   And until then, as always stay deep.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:04.960]   Hey, so if you like today's discussion about decoding discipline, I think
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:11.440]   you'll also like episode 256, where we also took a closer look at exactly what
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.840]   we mean by this idea of discipline.
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:14.840]   Check it out.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:15.840]   I think you'll like it.
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.560]   Why does cultivating the deep life start with discipline?
