[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   So in today's deep dive, I want to talk about the long game.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.340]   What you can do right now to avoid five or 10 years in the future having regrets or looking
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.840]   back and saying, what have I actually been doing with my time?
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.240]   In other words, what can you do right now so that when you get to the next major milestone
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.240]   in your life, whether that's turning 25 or 30 or 40, you can be content with how things
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.600]   have been going.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.460]   This type of advice is different than the type of advice we typically cover on the show.
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.720]   Typically on the show, we're talking about what you can do right now.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.120]   How do you become more organized right now?
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.560]   How do you avoid distraction in your life right now?
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.760]   How do you make a key career decision that is looming right now?
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.040]   But when we look to these longer time horizons, how do we make sure that in five years, you're
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.360]   in a place you're really happy about?
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.320]   The advice feels a little different, requires some more patience, requires a little bit
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.600]   more long-term strategy.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.760]   So that's what I want to do.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.520]   I have three big ideas I have collected that are all about maximizing where you're going
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.480]   to end up in the intermediate future, making sure that when you get there, you don't feel
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.120]   like the last five or 10 years were wasted, something that just went by on autopilot.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.200]   The first idea is annual planning.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.000]   This is a key bridge between various other scales of planning that we talk about commonly
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.120]   on this show.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.920]   So probably the most common type of planning we discuss here is multi-scale planning, which
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.720]   is at the key to my advice of staying on top of your various initiatives in your professional
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.720]   life.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.960]   So for those who don't know, multi-scale planning talks about three scales.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.680]   You make a plan at roughly the quarterly or seasonal scale.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.440]   Here's what I'm working on this fall.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.760]   That's my goal for this fall.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.800]   You look at that plan every week to build a weekly plan.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.280]   All right, here's what I'm working on this week.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.160]   The weekly plan is also where you make some adjustments in your calendar.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.200]   It's also where you see, okay, these are the days I have open time.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.520]   These are the busy days and you figure out how to make the most of the days actually
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.040]   in front of you.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.320]   And then your weekly plan is what you look at each day when you make your daily time
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   block plan.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.200]   So quarterly, weekly, daily, that's multi-scale planning.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.640]   That's a key rhythm to being on top of things that need to get done in work and not just
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.640]   being reactive.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.080]   Approaching each day with your inbox or Slack channel, just driving everything you do.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.520]   So that's relatively small scale when we're talking about timelines.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.680]   We also often talk about on the show a much, much longer time horizon, more abstract type
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.400]   of planning, which we often call lifestyle centric career planning or lifestyle centric
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.120]   visioning where you create this big picture, somewhat abstract vision of where you want
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.640]   your life to eventually be.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.160]   And it's not just your work, it's where you live, what your day is like, what you're doing
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.360]   with your time, both professionally and non-professionally, your connection to community.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.000]   What is your, is it a vision in which you are in a small mountain town having a long
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.240]   walk in the woods with your dog each morning and writing in your field skin notebook?
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.000]   Or is it a vision in which you're in Manhattan and at the interesting underground bar where
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   there's an art show going on and you're connected to this culture of alive art?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.720]   You just get this visceral sense of what you want your life to look like, feel like, taste,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.320]   smell like, all the different senses.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   And that can be a good guide when you then figure out how you want to make decisions
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.320]   about your life.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.120]   So that's really future thinking, almost abstractly future thinking.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.640]   So we have like, what am I doing in like the weeks ahead?
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.640]   Where do I want to be in the non-specified future?
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.560]   Annual planning is how you actually build a bridge between these two things.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.600]   As the name implies, it's something you do once a year.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.680]   I do it on my birthday.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.080]   My birthday is in early summer, so that's a good time.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.660]   Early summer is a good time, late summer, early fall is a good time.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.800]   Some people do this on New Year's, but you have a consistent time where you do this,
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.560]   and you're able to step back, look at your big picture, lifestyle-centric vision, and
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.200]   say, "What am I doing this year to make bold steps closer to that vision?"
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.480]   And there's two types of things you're going to do in annual planning.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.180]   One is going to be making big decisions.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.440]   This is the right scale to make big decisions that will move you drastically closer to your
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.560]   vision.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.160]   It is also the time for you to lay out big picture projects or efforts for the year ahead
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.080]   that will also move you more closer to your decision.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.600]   So for example, the type of decision you might make is, "I want to change something significant
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.640]   about my job role.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.400]   I'm going to do that this year.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.280]   It's going to take me months of setting things up and working on this project over here and
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.480]   sun setting these projects, and I want to start the conversation about this by four
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.480]   months into the year."
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.720]   And this is something that a big decision that might happen on the annual scale.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.600]   There might be a major new project you decide, "Okay, now is the time.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.900]   This year, it's going to take me all year.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.560]   I'm going to launch this side hustle business venture that's part of this, get me closer
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.400]   to this bigger picture vision where I'm going to move remote or part-time, but this is,
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.700]   I'm going to start this whole project, or this is the year in which I'm going to try
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.680]   to sell my book."
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.120]   And there's a lot of steps that go into that, but I have this sort of big vision for what's
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.380]   going to happen.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.960]   Another thing that might happen when you're doing this annual planning is not something
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.360]   you're adding, but something you're taking away.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.440]   You know what?
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.600]   This thing I'm spending a lot of time on is getting in the way of things that are more
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   important.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.800]   It's not moving me closer to my big picture lifestyle-centric vision, so I'm going to
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.920]   shutter that side business.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.840]   I'm going to sunset this incredibly time-consuming hobby that I've been doing for years, but
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.800]   now is taking more time than it's going to help.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.080]   At work, I'm going to leave these committees and sort of drastically change what it is
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.120]   that I'm agreeing to work on over here.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.400]   I'm going to shut down a whole research direction.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.080]   So it could be adding something or simplifying, but these are where you make these major decisions
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.720]   and initiate these major projects that are going to move you closer to your vision.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.120]   So annual planning is a key bridge between the abstract big picture and the very concrete,
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.520]   "What am I working on this week or this month?"
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.780]   That's how you don't get stuck with the vagueness of, like, "I know what my life wants to be
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.880]   like one day," but you're stuck just going through the motions on where it is right now.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:33.560]   The annual planning is the lever that gets you out of that proverbial ditch.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:42.160]   Idea number two, leveraging slow compounding of activity.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.920]   This is something that is true for lots of highly valuable pursuits.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:56.120]   To reap the benefit of that pursuit typically requires a large amount of time.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.680]   In that time, you have to be making consistent action towards that pursuit.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.680]   The right way to think about this is like compounding interest.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.280]   If you look at one of those charts of, "I have $100 and it's compounding monthly at
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.720]   a particular interest rate, how is my money going to grow?"
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.080]   We're used to seeing those charts, those of us who have looked at a financial book or
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.600]   a website, and you see that it grows really slow, and then after a while that picks up
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   steam and then it grows really fast.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.040]   As the amount that's compounding gets larger, the amount being added by compounding grows,
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.400]   so the size of the amount of money grows, and then the compounding leaps again, and
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.920]   you have these charts where it takes off pretty quickly after a long period of relatively
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   slow-looking growth.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.640]   Well, that's the same for a lot of activities that you might undertake.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.360]   To adopt the mindset of, "This is a three-year play," and actually for the first year of
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.280]   consistently taking action on this particular interest, objective, or plan, I might not
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.760]   even see large notable returns, but I'm building the base on which the fast compounding is
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.000]   going to happen in the future.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.920]   That mindset is critical.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.800]   That's one of the key ways to take advantage of the five-year window is, "I'm going to
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.600]   launch a small number of actions that I'm going to take consistently for years."
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.400]   That's the type of thing that can really unlock big changes that five years from now you say,
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.960]   "Wow, I'm pretty happy with how things are going."
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.480]   We're used to this in fields that are non-professional.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.760]   Eating and exercise is classic.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.040]   We sort of know this.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:34.560]   If we do Chris Hemsworth's diet or exercise plan that he did for the Marvel movies, it's
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.880]   eating a lot of rice and chicken and they exercise two hours a day, two weeks in, you're
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.200]   not going to feel much different, eight months in, you're going to look a lot different.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.760]   We're used to it with that.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.680]   Changing how we eat and exercise, we know the scales there are large.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.280]   It's not going to be something we'll see in a week, but if we look at the year scale,
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.160]   we're going to see good things.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.180]   Musical instruments is the other touch point people have familiarity with.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:01.440]   If I practice my guitar once a day, give me two weeks and I'm still going to be pretty
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.880]   bad at guitar.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.280]   Give me two years, people are like, "Oh, this guy can jam.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.960]   This guy's pretty good at guitar."
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.020]   We're used to that.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.600]   We just need to expand that same model to other types of activities that we're not used
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.720]   to thinking about it that way.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.360]   For example, building up the ability to read high volume of complicated, interesting material.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.520]   Here's a 600 page book.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.880]   Let me get into it.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.880]   I can read it.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880]   I can read it in a week.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.920]   I can pull out really interesting stuff from it.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.920]   Here's another book.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.360]   Let me dive into it.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.440]   That is something that you build up with practice.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.240]   If you have a regular reading habit and you systematically over time increase both the
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.640]   volume and complexity, give that a year and you're going to be a much more adept reader.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.200]   Mastering a new technology or refining a useful professional skill.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.480]   It could be the same thing.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.320]   I'm working on this a little bit every week.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   A month from now, I might know a little bit about it.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.120]   But if I put in this consistent action over a year or two, I could be an expert at this
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:03.880]   statistical analysis technique, this new microelectronics building and engineering, programming a computer.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.880]   Whatever it is, consistent effort over a long enough period of time can get you a really
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.960]   big return.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.440]   Same thing for even building an intellectual foundation.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.760]   Hey, it's Cal here.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.080]   I just wanted to mention, if you want to have help taking action on the type of ideas we
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.120]   talk about in this show, sign up for my email newsletter.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.960]   The link is right here below in the description.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.640]   Two to four times a month, I send out detailed articles about the types of ideas we discuss
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.800]   here.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.960]   It's the best way to stay connected to me and my audience's quest to live a deeper life.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.800]   So sign up below.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:45.520]   Imagine having a couple of years from now, a really deep and informed political or philosophical
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.680]   or theological foundation on which you're able to pull great insight, shape your understanding
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.760]   of the world and make useful contributions to yourself and the world.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.000]   This sounds really appealing.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.400]   How do you get there?
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.520]   It's effort to learn again and again and again over a long period of time.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.800]   At first, you're reading a lot of stuff.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   You don't know a lot of stuff.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.320]   You don't understand it, but you stick with it for a year or so.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.800]   Activity compounds.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   Expertise grows.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.680]   That's the second idea.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.120]   If you don't want to live with regret, then you have to really lean into what can be gained
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.920]   by consistent action over longer time periods than we're comfortable thinking.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.320]   To do this, you need to make it regular.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.220]   It needs to be in your weekly plan.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.140]   You always remind yourself, this is what I'm doing.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.160]   The more regular and ritualized it is, the more likely you're actually to keep doing
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.900]   it.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.960]   Remind yourself every week of why you're doing it.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.520]   Focus on the process, not the outcome, because it could take a while before the outcomes
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.520]   are good.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.580]   Finally, be willing to adjust your approach on roughly the quarterly scale.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:47.540]   Look back and say, "Is the rituals I'm using to get better at mastering philosophy or computer
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.960]   programming or microelectronics, is this working or am I spinning my wheels?
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.960]   How can I adjust?
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.720]   Maybe I need to move over to a course or I need to raise the level of challenge."
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.680]   Really at the quarterly scale, constantly be adjusting so that you make sure that you
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.760]   actually are making progress.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.640]   The activities you're doing are making progress.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.920]   The key is give yourself a year or two of this type of consistent, constantly tweaked
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   effort.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.360]   You'll get good at things.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:20.080]   The third idea about making sure you don't end up with regrets is not fearing failure.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:26.220]   I often imagine that our lives fall into these grooves on the landscape of possibilities
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.400]   that are low energy.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   What's the path of least resistance forward from where we are now?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.960]   It's like a nuclear particle falling into the lowest energy state.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.280]   Now it's possible that this least resistance path you fall into is going to lead somewhere
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.840]   deep and satisfying and five, 10 years from now, you'll be happy where you are, but it's
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.120]   relatively arbitrary, so it's probably not going to.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.840]   So to get out of this groove, you have to expend a lot of energy.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.640]   It's going to take a lot of energy to try to push yourself out of this groove and into
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   another one.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:03.880]   So you have to be comfortable taking swings in your life in terms of projects you undertake
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.040]   or goals that you pursue that are really difficult and require a lot of energy.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.160]   Because if you're not expending a lot of energy, then you have no way of actually getting out
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.560]   of the groove that you're currently in.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.680]   Things that require a lot of energy, however, tend to be higher stakes.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.800]   You might succeed or you might fail.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.760]   If you knew you were going to succeed with it, it's not really that much energy probably
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.760]   that needs to be extended.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.120]   It's the idea that I'm taking a swing at this.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.280]   I'm going to try to take on this new competency in my job that's going to open up a lot of
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.280]   options and it's really hard.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.960]   I'm going to put myself on the line and say, "Trust me to do this and hold me accountable.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.160]   See how much money I brought in.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.440]   Your stakes here, you could fail.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.960]   I'm going to try to sell this book.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.960]   I sold a book.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   I'm going to write a book.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.480]   I need to sell a lot of copies of this book.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   I might not.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.840]   I might fail at that."
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.160]   It's a higher stake thing.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.280]   Higher stake things, you have a symmetry there.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:00.120]   The possibility of failure gives you bigger rewards on success.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:07.560]   From a psychological perspective, you should be more comfortable undertaking initiatives
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.080]   that have a real risk of notable failure, failure that you would not want to happen
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.040]   because it'd be public or embarrassing or high cost.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.720]   If you don't on a semi-regular basis have pursuits of this type, then you are not expending
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.320]   the intensity of energy needed to really change your trajectory in the landscape of possibilities.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.200]   If you're not expending that energy, there's no way that you're going to be able to easily
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.920]   move yourself into cooler, more interesting tracks.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.280]   This is more psychological than I think it is tactical.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.280]   Just being comfortable with it.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.280]   "Yeah, I'm going for this.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.680]   If this fails, I don't want it to, so I'm going to spend a lot of energy."
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.240]   A few of these things will fail, but it's in the expending of energy to avoid failure
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.440]   that you're going to find the successes that actually dislodge you from where you're stuck
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.760]   at the moment.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.440]   This is launching a side hustle business, serious attempt to sell a book, maybe outside
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.280]   of your work trying to get a community organization and a community that's important to you up
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.280]   and running successfully.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.280]   It's hard.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.280]   This might not work.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.960]   Try to gather people and be a leader and have this group make a difference.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.720]   It might not work.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.640]   If you're not expending energy towards something where the stakes are high, your chances of
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.120]   having control over where you end up is going to be low.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.280]   Those are my three ideas if we're thinking about how to avoid regret five years from
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   now.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.280]   We'll just summarize them.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:32.280]   Use annual planning to bridge your abstract values, ideas, and visions with your concrete
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.320]   planning in the short term.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.760]   Leverage slow compounding of activity.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.200]   You want to be willing and comfortable saying, "I'm going to do this for two years regularly,
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.320]   this work or activity or practice because what I want is two years from now where I'm
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.840]   going to be two years from now."
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.760]   That's leveraging compounding of activity.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:53.420]   That's how you get cool things, cool abilities, autonomy, a lot of career capital.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.280]   That's one of your best tools for doing that on the intermediate time scale.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.160]   Finally, stop fearing failure.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.960]   You need to go after things where you don't want to fail because that's the only thing
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.440]   that's going to motivate you to expend enough energy that you have a shot of actually getting
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.920]   unstuck from the grooves where you actually find yourself traveling through life.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.040]   Those are my ideas.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   It's a little different, Jesse.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.520]   I mean, it's similar to stuff we talk about, but wanting to have an effect tomorrow is
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.760]   a different style of advice than wanting to have an effect on five years from now.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.880]   The annual planning was a big one for me because otherwise there's such a gap between your
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.400]   abstract vision.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.800]   My strategic plan for work, my semester plan, has this vision at the top.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.200]   It's five properties, but they're abstract, like autonomy and impact.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.320]   It's these things that are very abstract.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.160]   I wasn't making progress towards that.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.680]   If I was, it was haphazard.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.800]   The annual planning has been such a big change.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.000]   Like, "Okay, I'm going to make this move in my career.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.480]   I'm going to do this with my company this year.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.280]   I'm going to start this company this year."
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.580]   The annual scale is when that stuff could happen.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.480]   Some of these big decisions that moved me closer to my vision are too big for, "What
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.840]   am I going to do this fall?"
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.320]   So having that annual scale made a big difference.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.760]   You've been doing the annual for how many years?
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   A long time.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   20?
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   Probably.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.160]   I don't know when I started associating with my birthday.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.200]   I think that was after I had kids because I would consciously take a day on my birthday.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.080]   What I wanted to do on my birthday was to bring my notebooks and go on a long hike or
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.040]   walk to go through and go through that planning.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.120]   So I think once I started having kids is when I really shifted that to my birthday, but
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.400]   it's made a big difference.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   Now you bring your Remarkable?
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.920]   Now I bring my Remarkable.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.920]   All the notebooks are there.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.680]   I think I now have over 20 notebooks in my Remarkable.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.680]   So it's adding up.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.680]   All right.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.520]   So we want to get the questions here in a second.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.280]   First I want to talk about one of the sponsors that makes this show possible, and that is
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.720]   our friends at Shopify, a global commerce platform that helps you sell at every stage
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.980]   of your business.
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:05.720]   We're talking from the launch your online shop stage to the real life store stage, all
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.880]   the way to the did we just hit a million order stage.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:15.360]   Shopify is there to help you grow and to service you at each one of those stages.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.040]   You've used Shopify checkouts before.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:23.200]   You might not just realize it because you use it as the whatever your company is.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:29.440]   You can use Shopify to make your e-commerce experience incredibly high class and a really
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.120]   quality customer experience.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.640]   And the customers might not even realize that Shopify technology that's running it.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.880]   So if you found yourself buying something from someone online and really enjoying the
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.960]   experience, they're probably using Shopify.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.240]   I mean, I think if we were ever to start an e-commerce corner of our little media empire
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.600]   here, I think Jesse and I both agree it would be Jesse Skeleton related merchandise.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.160]   I mean, I think a shirt with like the Jesse Skeleton head and the microphone would be
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.160]   a big seller.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.160]   Yeah, I think.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.160]   Right.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160]   I mean, I think it'd be awesome.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:08.760]   I want like a, either like a shepherd fairy style, like with Obama or like a Che Guevara
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.280]   style poster type thing on the shirt, but it's Jesse Skeleton.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.540]   How if we were to do this, which we should, the easiest part of that would be the e-commerce
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.880]   piece because we just use Shopify.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.960]   And it'd be a great experience.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.320]   It remembers people's information from other places they've shopped.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.320]   It's quick.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   It's good at conversion.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:34.160]   The stat I have here is they, their conversion when you use the Shopify software for your
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:41.800]   e-commerce setup is 36, 36% better on average compared to other leading commerce platforms.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.760]   So you should sign up today for a $1 per month trial period.

[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.420]   I also want to talk about our friends at Hinson Saving.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.160]   This is the razor that I use.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.760]   I love the Hinson guys because their, their course expertise, we've talked about this
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.480]   before, but their core expertise before they got into the razor game and it continues to
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.720]   be one of their core expertise is today is precision milling of parts for the aerospace
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   industry.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.640]   We're talking about parts on the Mars rovers or the international space station.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:33.600]   So they have these high precision CNC routers that can mill metal to incredible precision.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.160]   This allows you to build a much better razor.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.600]   So the Hinson razor is this sort of beautifully milled, I believe it's aluminum where you
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:46.240]   can put just a standard 10 cent blade, screw it into their razor body.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.720]   And because of the precision in which this is manufactured, there is just a less than
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.100]   a human hair width worth of blade extending past the razor body.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.760]   This gets rid of the wobbly diving board effect that creates nicks that gets things trapped.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:06.440]   And so with just one 10 cent blade, you can get a very close shave.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:11.720]   So Hinson razor is what I use because I love having a beautifully constructed tool as opposed
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.640]   to something disposable or plastic.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.560]   I love that it's cost efficient.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.960]   You spend more upfront to get this beautiful razor, but because you're using just 10 cent
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:28.560]   blades and not the 27 vibrating laser power plastic contained blades you buy at the drug
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.440]   store and subscription services, it's very cheap to maintain the razor.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.520]   In fact, we will give you if you use a promo code, we'll talk about here in a second, two
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.440]   years worth of blades just for free.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:46.680]   When you buy this razor, you won't have to touch shaving equipment for two years because
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   the blades are really cheap.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.800]   So the cost of running this razor ends up being much less.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.480]   So anyways, a big fan of Hinson, love well made tools, love things that also save you
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.780]   money over time.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.400]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.560]   Visit hinsonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use the code CAL and you'll get
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.500]   two years worth of blades free with your razor.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.480]   Just make sure you add the two year supply of blades to your cart.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.780]   When you go and enter the promo code later, the cost of those will go to zero when you
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:15.840]   check out.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:24.280]   That's 100 free blades when you head to H-E-N-S-O-N-S-H-A-V-I-N-G.com/cal and use the code CAL.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.800]   You should get the Hinson folks to do, as we build out our Jesse Skeleton store, if
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:35.080]   we're going to have medallions, which I think we should, like Minto Mori's type medallions,
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.360]   they can mill them to incredible precision.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360]   Because I think that's important.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.360]   Important use of their material.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   All right, enough of this nonsense.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   Let's do some questions.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.040]   Jesse, who's kicking us off today?
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.000]   Hi, first question from Sophie.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.720]   What habits do you set up in your life to remind you of how short life really is and
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.760]   not to get trapped in the rat race?
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:02.000]   See, this is why we need a Jesse Skeleton Memento Mori medallion that you can just stare
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.720]   at every day and remind yourself life is short.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.240]   Actually, I think it would have the opposite impact that people would stare at that.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.400]   It would remind them that entities like Jesse Skeleton exist in this world and they would
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400]   say, I'm going to go drink.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.680]   Like, you know, I might as well just start drinking.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.880]   That would have the opposite effect.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.680]   Good question, Sophie.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.920]   Obviously, this fits with the theme of the today's show, which is how do you avoid looking
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.320]   back with regret on the period of life you just came out of?
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.840]   There's three things I can suggest.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.080]   One thing I'm going to point out from our deep dive and two new things I didn't mention
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.720]   in the deep dive.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.120]   So from the deep dive, you're going to take one thing from that deep dive to make sure
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.440]   that you don't just end up trapped in the rat race and having some regrets is do the
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.840]   annual planning.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.840]   All right.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.640]   Once a year, step back and say, what are what are where am I?
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.640]   Take stock.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.320]   What are the major decisions I want to make this year that's going to have a drastic change
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.680]   in the trajectory of my life?
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   What major projects or initiatives am I going to work on all year to again have a major
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.360]   impact on the direction of my life?
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.600]   That's how you avoid getting trapped.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.720]   In a complacent spiral where years pass by and you say, what did I what was I doing?
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.000]   Why didn't I change things?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.600]   Annual planning is going to be your best tool there.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.000]   Here's a couple more tactical things you can do as well.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.800]   Read heavily.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   Good stuff.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.120]   Interesting stuff.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:34.760]   I think exposing yourself to the world of ideas, philosophy and general history, theology,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.440]   politics, but interesting pushing yourself, complicated stuff.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:44.000]   Not the polemical book where someone is like, why the other team is the worst, but, you
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.080]   know, reading the original thinkers that the people that the political books are citing
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.320]   were influenced by this type of thing.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.960]   So just exposing yourself to the beauty of ideas and the world and the possibilities
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.240]   that goes a long way to not just getting stuck complacent because it allows you to see the
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.880]   world through an eye of much more sophistication.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.080]   And then that allows you to pull much more and appreciate much more out of the world.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.720]   So you don't want your just as you don't want your decisions to keep you trapped in complacency.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:21.200]   You don't want your mind to get trapped in a confined, non-interesting world, abstract
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.160]   cage of mediocre ideas.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.820]   So read heavily.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.960]   The third thing I'll recommend is expose yourself to art.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.600]   And I'm using the word art here a little bit.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:37.040]   Generally, I mean, things where you have incredible creative talents working at their highest
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.720]   level to try to produce things of great value to those who encounter it.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.920]   So this could be visual arts like painting.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.680]   This could be really good fiction.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.920]   This could be movies, for example, which I'm, of course, very interested in.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.160]   It could be music.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.760]   It could even be a really deep appreciation of athletics.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.960]   There's something about building up a connoisseur like appreciation of something that touches
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:12.560]   the human spirit when it's executed at the high level that pushes you away from complacency.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.720]   This is why, for example, I'm very interested in movies and I'm sort of an amateur cinephile
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.040]   and I watch a lot of movies and read a lot about movies.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:25.480]   I derive a lot of inspiration from especially directors who I admire.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.640]   Just seeing them pushing themselves to create these works that end up having a real impact
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.760]   on people who watch it and build off these prior inspirations pushes me in the other
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.280]   parts of my life.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:44.440]   Pushes me out of the tendency like let's just get complacent and publish the deep work
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.840]   for toddler workbook and just sort of get stuck in the wheels.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.160]   You see this a lot where people just get stuck in the wheels of like, I don't know, just
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.440]   making my online numbers high.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.680]   It pushes me out of that.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.400]   To be exposed to people in a completely other field doing something artistic and really
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:05.160]   pushing themselves just for the sake of it being more interesting pushes me forward in
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.400]   what I'm doing.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.180]   So expose yourself to art as well.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.920]   The only caveat I would get there is if you are in a creative field, expose yourself to
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.240]   art in a different field.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:19.480]   I write about this in my new book, Slow Productivity, which is coming out in March, specifically
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.380]   about my use of movies to help me with my writing.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.960]   When you're looking at great work in your own field, that's important to do, but it's
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.720]   not as motivating because it's too close to home.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.920]   So the motivation also gets covered with other feelings of why am I not doing that?
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   Well, why did that succeed?
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.080]   Oh my God, I'm never going to be able to do that.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.760]   There's a real value to actually looking at the art in a completely different field than
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.760]   you're involved in.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.440]   So you can just appreciate the mindset and the pursuit without getting distracted by
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.040]   the details in the weeds.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.460]   All right.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.720]   So annual planning, read heavily, expose yourself to art.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   All right.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.340]   Who do we have next, Jesse?
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.340]   Next question is from Arthur.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:01.120]   What are some of the warning signs someone could, should perhaps question their current
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.920]   life, career or happiness?
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   All right.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.360]   Warning sign number one.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.480]   If you put a non-trivial amount of time into creating jesseskeleton.com, I think it's a
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.480]   warning sign, Jesse.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   That's something you need to reevaluate your life.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.240]   No, you need to applaud yourself.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.120]   Let's be honest about that.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.720]   No, serious question.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   Okay.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.400]   How do you know that a change is needed?
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.620]   Well, of course, I'm going to recommend first lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:36.400]   So you want to create this visceral vision of what you want every aspect of your life
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.240]   to be like that resonates with you.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.540]   So this involves like what you're doing, where you live, what your day is like, where, who
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.080]   you're interacting with.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.200]   You have to have this visceral, like you're almost filming a stay in the life scene of
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.180]   a movie of what you want your life to look and feel like.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:29:02.880]   You're looking for concrete scenes in this vision that give you that feeling of, oh yeah.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.080]   And it's different for different people.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.480]   Again, we talked about this earlier in the show.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.480]   We gave the same example.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.400]   I mean, for some people, it's like the scene that resonates is they've walked out the door
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.820]   into a trail with their dog to a pond in the middle of these woods where they're going
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.080]   to sit down and they're working on writing something, a notebook.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:23.080]   And other people, it's this, you know, they're in the city and there's this energy to it
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   and there's, they're at a club and listening to this new jazz musician.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.120]   And there's just different fields, different fields to it for different people.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.960]   It's these concrete scenes that resonate.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.380]   So you want to fix that.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.100]   You have your lifestyle, ideal vision, ideal lifestyle vision.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:42.760]   Now we can decide our major changes needed because probably you're going to find yourself
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.020]   in one of two situations at this point.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:52.960]   Situation number one, there is no obvious way to move from where you are right now,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.000]   close to that vision.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.960]   There is no, okay, in what I'm doing right now with where I live, my work, my life, if
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.040]   I can tweak my compass a little bit and make some good decisions, I'm going to move towards
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.040]   that vision.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.640]   You might be in a situation where like, no, I'm nowhere near it.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:13.000]   I want to be in the woods with my dog writing, you know, Mary Oliver style in a field notes
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.120]   notebook next to the pond.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:21.440]   And I'm a banker in Manhattan and it just in the small part, I have, there's no connection
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440]   from this to that.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.920]   So you're like, great, let me just tweak this.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.800]   And if I do this at my next, no, you're very far from it in that situation.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.480]   Then yeah, major changes will be needed.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.280]   Now you know what those changes are aiming for.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.600]   And you begin to think about, okay, given the career capital I already have given my
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.240]   existing skills, but also my opportunities, like my company, maybe where else do they
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.000]   have satellite offices?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.080]   What other types of things can you do with my skills?
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.560]   Where do I have family that, you know, you think through all of your different assets
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:54.200]   here, metaphorical assets, not financial and figure out how do I best leverage these to
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.560]   move my life closer to the vision and major changes are needed.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:04.460]   I need to lead banking in Manhattan, but I can use these economic skills to do this type
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.560]   of work consulting, you know, whatever is the books for nonprofits.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.720]   And I could go do this for this company that does it remotely.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.200]   And if I do this for five years, I could then probably have my own shop after that and get
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.560]   a lot of autonomy.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.640]   So if I move from this to this, then I could move after two years to here.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:25.200]   And then after five, you start making the plan based on the assets and career capital
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.840]   I have, how do I get closer to the vision?
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.560]   The other situation you might find, however, after identifying your ideal vision is that,
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.600]   okay, I'm proximate.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.600]   This is not working for me.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.600]   This is not working for me.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.640]   This is working for me.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.520]   Let's start making some tweaks to get us closer there.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.060]   I need to take this off my plate, add this.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.760]   I need to move from this office to that office.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:51.720]   I need to, this is fine, but we need to move from this house in the suburb to this house
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.160]   farther out in the countryside.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.280]   Okay, that's going to take, I'm going to need a little bit more money in this and that.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.960]   Okay, that'll take about two years, but I see how this is all going to work.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.560]   So that's the other case.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.240]   Like, great, I just need to keep my plans going and my tweaks, but it's not a major
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   change.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.920]   I'm just, I see the four or five tweaks I need to make and now I'm much closer to my
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.920]   vision.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.420]   The key is all of this, both of those scenarios and the specific decisions made in both those
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:20.020]   scenarios is all driven backwards from a vision.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.200]   If you're just trying to move forward, what don't I like?
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   What might I like better?
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.420]   Do I, I don't like this job.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.660]   What, why I like that job better?
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.540]   If you're just looking down the road and said, I want to turn here, turn there, just
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:35.180]   looking forward from where you are to the immediate time horizon forward, you have no
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.980]   real focus to these decisions.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.180]   You're leaving your path to go on nearby paths.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.960]   You're haphazardly wandering and hope that you end up somewhere better.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.780]   But when you're working backwards from this vision that's so visceral and resonates, then
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.600]   you can really make these smarter decisions.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.180]   And whether it's a major change or not, all that will be very clear because they're for
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.700]   a purpose.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.580]   So work backwards from that vision and then you'll see exactly, exactly where you should
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.580]   be.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.620]   All right, what do we got next, Jesse?
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.960]   Next question's from Max.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.300]   Most people at the government institution I am working at are comfortable and there
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.460]   are zero expectations of me.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.620]   I like a lot of things about my working conditions.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.100]   I can exercise, work from home, stuff like that.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.540]   My problem is that now I am under stimulated and I think my potential is slipping away.
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:25.140]   My vision of deep life is unclear and I feel lost.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.820]   How do you think I make a vision of the deep life I'm excited for and how do I get my old
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.060]   drive and discipline back?
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:37.400]   Well, given your current situation, so your job is easy, you don't mind it, right?
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:43.820]   So it has none of what in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You that we call disqualifiers,
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.320]   properties that means you got to get out of this job.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.220]   It doesn't have any of that.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.380]   You're fine with it.
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:55.340]   I would say let's spend at least a year really working on the other parts of your life.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:58.760]   Take advantage of this flexibility that you have in your current job to really get the
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.480]   other parts of your life in order.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.800]   And really the right way to do this is going to be the deep life stack strategy.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.100]   I think it's the right thing to do here.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.100]   Reclaim your discipline.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:13.260]   Okay, here's a I want to reshape yourself as someone who's disciplined, that can do
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.100]   hard things, even if they're not immediately necessary.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.400]   Do this in multiple parts of your life.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   Then you want to retune up your values.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400]   What am I really about?
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.660]   What do I care about?
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.300]   What are the rituals that help remind me or connect me to these values?
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.980]   What's the code by which I live?
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:28.980]   So let's get more serious about this.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.340]   It's a good time in life to get very serious about this.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.900]   Then you want to organize.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.860]   Okay, now let me get my act together.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.140]   Let me organize my life at work, my life outside of work.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:44.380]   Let me our finances, how we work on household projects, how I sort of organize, pursue,
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.020]   leisurely pursuits, get control over what's going on.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.540]   You control your time.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.500]   You control your activity load.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.860]   Now you're opening up options.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:58.260]   And after you've gone through all of that, now you can say, let's start planning for
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.260]   the remarkable.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.980]   And even here, I would say, choose one or two things non-professional, remarkable pursuits,
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.620]   and go after that full out.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:12.180]   A leisure pursuit, a community pursuit, philosophical, theological, political pursuit.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:17.460]   Have something that's really now taking up your energy that is driving you somewhere
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.460]   remarkable.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.460]   Do that.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:24.140]   Okay, we've moved all the way up to the stack, all the way to the top.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:29.260]   Now I would say, let's step back and reassess what's going on with work.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.700]   And here's where you can really step back and do lifestyle-centered career planning
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:37.740]   and say like, okay, is there a major change in job that's needed to move me most closer
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.580]   to my ideal lifestyle?
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:43.020]   Or is it like, let me just tweak what I'm doing in the government to get rid of some
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.700]   attributes I don't like and kind of move my way towards a position that's just the sweet
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.700]   spot for me.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.860]   Like I like the work, it's flexible, and just let that be my financial foundation.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.580]   I have all this other stuff going on.
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.820]   All that you can work out, I would say, after you go through the deep life stack.
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:02.500]   What you don't want to do is if your life is ungrounded, to start with a job.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.860]   That is the concern I have.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:08.100]   It is why we introduced a whole deep life stack methodology, is that if you're ungrounded,
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.900]   you've just been wandering through life.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.580]   You focus first on your job because that's how you spend most of your time.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.540]   But to use that as the fulcrum, like, well, this is what's going to heal me.
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:25.860]   If I make a big swing here, quit the government and start a skeleton medallion company.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.340]   Big swing, the change itself is going to make me feel better.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.340]   This is the key.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.340]   This is my job is not right.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.540]   And you haven't worked on any of these other parts of cultivating the deep life.
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:41.100]   You just end up with a lot of overpaid bills, a garage full of skeleton medallions, and
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.060]   you're just as unhappy as you were before.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.940]   The deep life stack methodology is like, let's get a foundation under us.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:46.940]   What are we all about?
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.700]   Let's get discipline and control over things.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.980]   Let's practice pursuing remarkable things and we have that efficacy.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.860]   Okay, now let's figure out the big vision.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.780]   And again, you will get clarity once you get there.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:04.460]   I bet you'll end up with tweaking your job.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.460]   You know, I want to move from here to here.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.240]   I don't have a managerial role.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.140]   That's like a lot of meetings, but I could move over here if I'm good and make the right
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.140]   moves.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.980]   This is like a non managerial role that is going to be better suited.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.220]   It's a little bit more autonomous, but also maybe a little bit more interesting.
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.300]   And you can just tweak in there.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.300]   You're like, this is great.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.700]   And this is fine.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.700]   Or maybe you know, you see a vision that involves you doing something completely different.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:29.700]   You know, who knows?
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.100]   But I just would say don't start with that.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:37.260]   Start with everything else and then return to return to the job piece.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.240]   So in the deep life stack methodology, that's why all these changes to your jobs are pretty
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.380]   high up in the stack.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.940]   It's not that it's not where you start.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:48.980]   So I do think that's where people get into trouble sometimes.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.220]   All right, let's do a call, Jesse.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.860]   Yeah, we haven't done a call in a while.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.740]   Let's cross our fingers.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:38:01.460]   The tech is not easy to live stream these pre-recorded calls, but I think we're gonna
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.460]   make it happen.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.460]   All right, let's do a call.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.460]   I'm excited about this.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.460]   I haven't heard this yet, too.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.460]   So this is going to be...
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:07.460]   Hey, Cal, Philip here.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:15.700]   I have a question about how you differentiate between obligations and ambiguous ideas in
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.580]   your weekly planning and task boards.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.820]   One of the problems I've been having is I've been building a software project that has
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.780]   this ambiguous space of different problems I could be working on.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:35.460]   And mixed in with that are some obligations that have clear, unambiguous problems, like
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.440]   click this button and the page is broken.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.260]   That's an unambiguous problem.
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.180]   But speed up the site is more of an ambiguous problem.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:48.260]   And one of the issues I've been seeing is that my past self can go in and take these
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:53.940]   ambiguous ideas and turn them into unambiguous tasks to do.
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:59.020]   But that when I go in to actually do those tasks, my thinking might have changed or I
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:04.340]   sometimes went from this problem space to the solution space too quickly.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:09.500]   So I wanted to ask, how do you handle some of these ambiguous problems?
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:14.140]   And at what point do you go from the kind of problem space to the solution space?
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.740]   I think this could apply to how do you write a book and at what level of ambiguity do you
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.700]   keep things in your task list?
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:25.620]   And is it okay for there to be a lot of ambiguity in terms of more problem space definition
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.300]   than solution space as you're doing your weekly plans?
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.300]   Thank you.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:33.500]   Well, it's a good question because it does apply to a lot of different types of large
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.940]   projects that have ambiguity about the right way to execute them.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:41.280]   So not just software development, he mentioned book writing and there's any other number
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.900]   of problems in there as well.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:50.700]   So I think what's key here is you don't want to move from the ambiguous to the concrete
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.560]   too early or too expansively.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.900]   So where you get into trouble is where you try to generate a large number of concrete
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:05.340]   tasks from some sort of ambiguous initiatives and you really populate out your task list
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.540]   with dozens of things.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.220]   And in some sense, it's weeks of work that you're trying to put into the task list.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:14.320]   Because as you say, it's very difficult to predict ahead of time what are the right things
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   to work on.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   And your brain knows this.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.940]   And after a while, these tasks you generated go stale.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.180]   And then your brain is saying, do I really want to work on this?
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.260]   Is this really important?
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.460]   This just seems now like an arbitrary game of task whack-a-mole.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.180]   Here's a task that I put on a list.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.220]   I get a buzzer and my points go up if I whack it back down.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:39.020]   So what you want to do is have a much shorter cycle of concrete task generation.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.460]   This is what I'm working on this week.
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.100]   This thing right here is very concrete.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.780]   I want to find out, here's my load time and I want to make some of these concrete changes
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.180]   to see if I can make my load time better.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.020]   I can do this in a couple sessions.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:57.380]   This is what they figured out in software development starting in the early 2000s with
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:02.620]   what's known as agile methodology, where they realized trying to plan out entire software
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.860]   projects from scratch.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.620]   This and then we'll do this and then we'll do this.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.620]   They use these things called waterfall diagrams that had the dependencies.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.860]   You could have years worth of work all laid out and how long they're going to take.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.940]   And you could use this to build these detailed budgets of how many hours, programmer hours
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.780]   it was going to take and what the exact timelines would be.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.780]   And these things never worked.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.580]   And you would get about a month into these projects.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:30.700]   And then you were just either grimly following these now out of date or stale plans or having
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.700]   to rewrite them.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:35.700]   So agile came along and said, just work on one thing at a time.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:38.060]   What's the most important next thing we could do right now?
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.020]   Just go do that for like three days and come back.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:43.060]   And let's ask again, what's the most important thing we could do right now?
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:49.100]   Keep it very short cycle between identifying of a problem, action and back to it.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:53.140]   So these more ambiguous things you're talking about should not exist on a task list.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:58.660]   This is probably going to be if you use multi-scale planning on your quarterly or some seasonal
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.660]   plan.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.940]   Okay, we're working on this software project this fall.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:07.740]   We have a vague, vague-ish place where we want to be by the end of the fall.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.540]   We want a minimal viable product that is available and people are testing it.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.260]   And that just sits there in your quarterly plan.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.980]   Then when it comes to your weekly plan, it's like, okay, so what are we working on this
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.940]   week that's going to help us make progress towards this bigger goal?
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:26.540]   Well, let me just survey the landscape of issues and come up with one that we can make
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.660]   progress on right now.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:31.420]   And then that's just all you're doing and all you care about till that's done.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.900]   And what they do in Agile methodology is they have a place to collect ideas for this.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.420]   So you could have this in your seasonal or quarterly plan.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.180]   You start collecting ideas.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:44.620]   Well, we need to work on loading speed and we need to fix the, here's a button, here's
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:45.620]   an issue.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.300]   And you can collect those somewhere.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.300]   That's fine.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.780]   You can collect those somewhere, but don't think of those as tasks.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.380]   These are just putting pins in various things that might be useful.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:58.900]   And you just trust yourself on the small scale when it comes to the weekly scale that you
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.020]   can kind of survey all the different stuff that's out there that you've jotted down
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:06.780]   that you need to work on or is important that you'll be capable in the small scale of saying
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.780]   of all this stuff, this is a good one to do next.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.780]   And let me just do this next.
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:15.380]   Because one of the things that Agile realizes, you can only do one thing at a time anyway.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.900]   So it doesn't help to say, I'm doing these five things.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.180]   It makes you feel better in the moment because you imagine having those five things done,
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.620]   but you can only do one thing at a time.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.460]   So might as well do one thing at a time.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.860]   This applies to a lot of projects.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:32.260]   You can collect somewhere your notes or ideas about what needs to happen or issues that
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.460]   need to be resolved.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:38.420]   When it comes to having concrete tasks that you're scheduling and they're in your list,
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.700]   it should be what you can work on next.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.500]   All right.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:49.660]   So just trying to create a huge list of concrete tasks and have them all on your list.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:54.300]   I just think that creates a waterfall effect stress.
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.940]   So be okay with these larger projects.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.980]   Be okay with only a small number of things will make it onto my to do list at a time
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:02.980]   from this project.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.500]   And I trust myself each week to figure out what the best next thing is to do.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.580]   I don't need everything to be in here.
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.980]   I don't need some more complicated long term planning as well.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.380]   And so be a little bit more Agile.
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.020]   I think that'll work better.
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.460]   All right.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:22.420]   So as our final part of our question segment here, I want to do a case study.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.380]   This is where someone writes in explaining or talking about how they applied some ideas
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.780]   from our show in a way that is interesting or successful.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.660]   The case study I want to report today comes from Mark.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.660]   All right.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.660]   So here's what Mark says.
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.700]   I'm writing a book.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.140]   It's an academic book in my field, which is musicology.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.020]   And I've been using Cal's approaches for a couple years now.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:51.180]   I've gone from a haphazard researcher writer to a true professional using his approaches.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.940]   I added a fun new element.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.780]   I designed and printed custom writing t shirts for myself.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:59.160]   They are just plain black t shirts, but I made a secret label on the inside.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.340]   It says this black shirt is for creating.
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.280]   And I added a small logo on one sleeve.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   The rule I have set for myself is that when I put on one of these t shirts, I can't go
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.260]   to sleep again until I do significant writing.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.500]   At least an hour, but usually deep work sessions of two to four hours.
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.940]   I definitely don't need these shirts to write, but just like the countless examples Cal has
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.740]   given of other creators going to great lengths to signal to themselves that it's time to
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:30.580]   create such as Brandon Sanderson's underground layer, which is where he wrote Name of the
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.780]   Wind by the way.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.820]   These shirts have been a fun way to get work done and go deep.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.900]   I've submitted a book proposal, edited two chapters, completed drafts of two more chapters,
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.820]   and I'm halfway through the third chapter now.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.900]   I have never had more momentum.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:49.780]   Well, I appreciate that case study Mark, because I think it does underscore a point we talk
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.700]   about a lot.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:56.060]   Ritual and setting matters when it comes to trying to do hard things with your brain.
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:02.320]   This is not natural for the human brain to concentrate on symbolic or abstract notions
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.380]   for extended periods of time.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:08.260]   So everything we can do to help put our brain into that setting, the better.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.140]   So things that seem weird from the outside, a black shirt that has a hidden label that
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.860]   says the shirt is for creating, it seems weird.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:16.380]   But you know what else is weird?
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.180]   Sitting down to write a textbook on musicology.
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:22.180]   This is not something that the Paleolithic human spent a lot of time caring about.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.500]   We don't have an evolutionary pressure for it.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:29.740]   So the more we think about deep work as a noble, but unusual and demanding activity,
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:37.300]   I think the more we can embrace unusual rituals and settings to help try to induce those states.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:41.980]   So I love hearing these types of examples of people going increasingly over the top
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:48.020]   to help put themselves and their mind into a deep work mindset.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.820]   I think the Brandon Satterson example is great.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:50.820]   That's one of my favorites.
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:55.820]   We talked about this on the show before, but the fantasy writer Brandon Satterson in his
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:03.580]   suburban house, suburban Utah, in a cul-de-sac, he owned a lot next to it, underground, built
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:10.300]   this essentially giant bunker, multi-room bunker, completely decked out in a high-end
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:16.820]   sort of Victorian Gothic decor in which he writes, he has a movie theater down there,
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.740]   he podcasts down there, they have meetings down there for his companies.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:24.380]   I mean, it's completely over the top and unnecessary and just fantastic.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:29.020]   If that's your job is to write fantasy, why not have a fantastical place to do it?
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:34.140]   I mean, just to go to a grim home office and it's just generic and you're at the white
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:37.940]   desk and you have, you know, laundry baskets in there.
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:42.620]   I mean, that's just adding ankle weights to the basketball player.
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.380]   It's an unforced error.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:48.300]   You're making the cognitive work you're about to do harder.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.420]   It doesn't have to be.
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:54.260]   So embracing the cool and the unusual, I'm always here for that, Jesse, so I'm glad that
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.260]   people send in examples.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:00.300]   So I want to get to a final segment, cool study I want to talk about.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:05.700]   First let's mention another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:11.340]   This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:17.380]   So as we, as we get into in the show a lot, the life of the mind is its own important
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.380]   thing.
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:22.480]   I mean, we were just talking about this in the last case study, how the mind is fickle
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.600]   and to do something like convince it to think deeply about a novel for a few hours is something
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.620]   that requires a lot of work.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.620]   Well because the mind is so fickle, it can also fall into states or configurations that
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.860]   can hold us back.
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:42.820]   You might have, for example, constant ruminations, negative ruminations on things that have happened
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.480]   or anxious ruminations of things that are going to happen in the future.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.300]   You could have these thought patterns that really are making your life harder, making
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.700]   it harder for you to do the things that you really value, that make you feel bad more
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.140]   than you want to feel bad.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.260]   Well there are something you can do about this.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:06.540]   It turns out that professionals know how to work with your mind and build, rebuild a more
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:12.700]   comfortable, happy relationship, more sustainable relationship with your mind.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.940]   This is what you get from professional therapy.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:19.580]   Now the problem that a lot of people have, even if they know they could use some help,
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:24.060]   they want to improve their relationship with their brain is how do I find a therapist?
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.060]   Is there someone in my town?
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:29.260]   I mean, what if they're don't take my insurance or they're expensive or they're booked and
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.420]   this is true, especially these days that a lot of therapists, you'll call up their offices
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.540]   and they'll say, we have no openings.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:40.260]   How do you get into this world without this huge amount of difficulty up front?
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:45.040]   This is where BetterHelp enters the scene.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.640]   It's entirely online, designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.

[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:58.900]   you can switch therapists at any time for no additional charge.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:03.500]   So almost right away, you could be matched up online with a therapist and begin to work
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.500]   on replying.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.340]   You're repairing your relationship with your mind right away.

[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.380]   Also want to talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:38.980]   Let me put on my computer science hat for a moment.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:42.180]   I wonder what a computer science hat would actually look like.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:49.780]   I mean, it would probably have Vulcan ears and somehow a circuit board involved.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:50.780]   I don't know.
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.740]   But just imagine I'm wearing a computer science hat because I'm about to get real computer
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:54.980]   sciencey with you.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.380]   You need to be using a VPN.
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:01.180]   Because what happens is when you connect to the internet, people can see what sites or
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.020]   services you're talking to.
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:07.420]   If you're in a public wireless access point, anyone nearby can be reading your packets
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:11.420]   out of the airwaves and know that you are spending an inordinate amount of time on Jesse
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.420]   Skeleton.
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:16.840]   And if they figure that out, they're going to call the authorities as they probably should.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.060]   Same thing even when you're at home.
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:22.060]   You feel like you have privacy there, but your internet service provider can see what
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.980]   sites and services are you using.
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:28.300]   They can collect and sell that data to advertisers and believe me, they do.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:31.220]   A VPN protects you from that.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:35.740]   With a VPN, instead of connecting directly to the site or service you want to use, you
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:38.500]   connect instead to a VPN server.
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:42.540]   You then tell that server with an encrypted message, "Here is who I really want to talk
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.940]   with."
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:47.220]   And the VPN talks to that site or service on your behalf, encrypts the response and
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:48.420]   sends it back.
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:52.020]   So now the person at the coffee shop or your internet service provider knows nothing about
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:56.420]   what you're doing other than you're protecting your behavior using a VPN.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:58.140]   So you need a VPN.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:04.060]   If you're going to use one, I suggest you use the one that I use, which is ExpressVPN.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.860]   They've got servers all around the world.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.340]   There's probably one nearby wherever you happen to be.
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:13.360]   Or maybe you want to look at content that's only accessible in a certain region.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.060]   You can connect to a server in that region and get access to that content.
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.540]   So hint, hint, wink, wink.
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.660]   They have a lot of bandwidth and their software is real easy.
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:25.540]   You click to turn it on and you use your sites and services, your apps and browsers like
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.540]   normal.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:30.180]   All this is happening automatically in the background.
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:36.060]   So if you want to get three extra months of ExpressVPN for free, when you go to, you will
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:42.700]   get three extra months free if you go to ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:46.700]   So it's the /deep will give you three extra months for free when you sign up.
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.700]   So it's expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:48.700]   All right.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:53:03.060]   So now we've got to our final segment, a CalReact segment, find something that someone sent
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.260]   me or discovered that I think is worth discussing.
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:10.540]   And I want to talk about an academic paper that's making the rounds.
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.340]   Multiple people sent it to me.
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:16.620]   It has an interesting mathematical idea that I think helps explain a lot of things we experience
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:19.920]   in real life and gives us some ideas about solutions.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.420]   So I'm going to load this on the screen.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:27.380]   And again, if you're just listening to the show, you can see the show at the deeplife.com/listen
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.660]   episode 271.
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.820]   The videos are at the bottom of the episode page.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:31.820]   All right.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:36.580]   So what I have loaded on the page here is a, an economics paper.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:42.180]   I don't know if this has been published yet or if it's about to be published, but anyways,
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:49.740]   the name of the paper is when product markets become collective traps, the case of social
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:50.740]   media.
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:54.620]   I'm going to read you a few sentences here from the abstract.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.660]   They're going to sound a little bit like academic gobbledygook, but then we're going to decipher
[00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:59.580]   them and it's actually going to be somewhat profound.
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:00.580]   All right.
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:03.260]   So let me get my, my pen out here.
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:04.260]   All right.
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.700]   So here we go.
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:11.940]   In large scale incentivized experiments with college students, we show that while standard
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:18.180]   welfare measures, we're over here, suggest a large and positive surplus, our measure
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:23.980]   accounting for consumption spill overs indicates a negative surplus with a large share of active
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:27.980]   users deriving negative utility.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:31.900]   We also shed light on the drivers of consumption spill overs to non-users in the case of social
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:36.060]   media and show that in this setting, the fear of missing out plays an important role.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:40.940]   Our framework and estimates highlight the possibility of product market traps where
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:47.060]   large shares of consumers are trapped in an inefficient equilibrium and would prefer that
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.060]   the product not exist.
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:54.180]   I'm going to put a box here around the word inefficient equilibrium because I've been
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:58.620]   using this phraseology quite a bit in my recent talks on technology.
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:54:59.980]   So what does this all mean?
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:06.140]   Well, these are economists that we're studying in this case, social media use.
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:09.540]   And they were saying it's confusing.
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:17.380]   It's confusing sometimes when we directly study the individual user and we see how much
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:22.180]   they value social media, is the impact positive, is the impact negative?
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:26.940]   And it's confusing why we find so much usage.
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.780]   Like why are people using this?
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:34.540]   If for example, we can measure there's like a negative effect, it's making them less happy.
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:36.400]   We can see this.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.340]   And what they're arguing here is, okay, you also have to measure if you really want to
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:47.960]   understand consumer behavior for a large population, you also have to measure the impact of not
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.060]   using.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:55.820]   And when you integrate the impact of not using, interesting dynamics arise.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:01.020]   And their model that they work out here mathematically for social media based on data from experiments
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:05.300]   with students and incentives and seeing how much they value social media, the model that
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:08.700]   they derive here says, okay, here's what seems to be happening.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:12.260]   People do not like a lot about social media.
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:15.340]   We can measure that it directly makes their life negative in many ways.
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:20.060]   But there is also, especially for talking about young people, a really big cost to being
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:24.060]   the only person you know, not using it.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:27.620]   So the non-user has a big negative cost as well.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:32.300]   And is that non-user cost, which if we're going to use a rational economic model is
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.380]   outweighing the negatives of using it.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:39.660]   And that's why we find people stuck on the platform.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.980]   Now why is this called a collective trap or an inefficient equilibrium is because that
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:49.460]   negative cost of not using is only incurred if you're the only person to stop using it.
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:56.460]   So actually the better configuration in which the total amount of happiness is maximized
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:59.980]   is one in which most people stop using it.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:04.180]   Because then you avoid the negatives you get from being on social media.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:09.340]   And if most people are not using it, the negative cost of not using social media dissipates
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.020]   as well.
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:14.020]   They point out here in particular with the college students, they study fear of missing
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.700]   out being the main negative cost.
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:20.500]   If you're not missing out, not being on social media, you lose that negative cost.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.580]   Then you might as well get rid of the negative cost of using social media.
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:28.400]   So why we have so many people using it at the same time that they're so unhappy about
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.980]   it is because they are in an inefficient equilibrium.
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:37.940]   Now this terminology comes out of the game theory work, the nonlinear dynamics of John
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:43.420]   Nash, Nobel laureate John Nash, subject of the Russell Crowe movie, A Beautiful Mind,
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.780]   and of course the Sylvia Nassar biography on which that movie was based.
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:49.060]   This was the key contribution.
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:54.220]   This is what won John Nash the Nobel Prize in economics is that he figured out in game
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:58:01.540]   theory what happens is you get stuck in these equilibriums, meaning there's no change any
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:05.960]   individual can make to their strategy to make themselves better off.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:10.700]   But the equilibrium is not the best possibility for everyone.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:15.860]   In other words, no one person can make their situation better, but if we all change together,
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:17.300]   we could be in a better configuration.
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:18.300]   We're stuck.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:22.420]   We call it an inefficient equilibrium because we're far from the maximum positive value
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:27.820]   that we could be creating, but we can't get to the maximum possible value because no one
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.760]   person can make the change on their own.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.120]   If one person leaves, things get worse.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.500]   This is what social media is in this model.
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.580]   It's an inefficient equilibrium.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:40.220]   People are not happy that they're on TikTok all the time or Instagram all the time, but
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.660]   no one individual can make their situation better by leaving the service because then
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.420]   they're missing out because everyone else is on it.
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:49.720]   So we're stuck just being mildly unhappy because we want to avoid the even bigger unhappiness
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.920]   of being the odd person out.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.460]   But this configuration doesn't maximize our possible happiness.
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:59.480]   We'd all be much happier if we just didn't use it at all.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.860]   Our total happiness would be much higher, but no one person can get there.
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:05.780]   It's inefficient equilibrium.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:07.660]   Collective trap is another way of describing this.
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:11.540]   We're trapped using something we don't like because there's no easy way for us to unilaterally
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.900]   escape it without making things worse.
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:18.940]   Now, where I think this is particularly relevant in social media, like what is the particularly
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:24.860]   relevant corollary to this result, is that it really should change the way we think about
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:28.080]   social media and youth.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.620]   We know I've given talks on this.
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.020]   I'm deep into this research literature we've talked about on the show.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.380]   I have a YouTube video about this.
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.220]   We know there is now a strong signal.
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:39.660]   There's less debate about this now than there was three years ago.
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:44.700]   A strong signal that shows increasing social media use leads to increasing mental health
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:49.260]   negative outcomes for adolescents, especially prepubescent girls.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:53.220]   We know there's this negative impact between social media and youth.
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:57.980]   And we know that the self-reports from youth say, "This is making me anxious.
[00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:59.340]   This is what's making us anxious.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.340]   It is social media.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.780]   I don't like social media."
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:07.540]   Studies like this help us understand why they get stuck because it is an inefficient equilibrium.
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:11.680]   It is very difficult for a teenager to be the only teenager in their class who's not
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.680]   using social media.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.680]   That's even worse.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.180]   They have to use it and incur these negativities.
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:20.660]   So if we want to break these collective traps, this is where we can come in and say, "Well,
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.300]   how do we get more than one person not using this?
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.660]   How do we come in and get most people not using it or large swaths of people not using
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.660]   it?
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:33.120]   How do we get rid of the negative cost of choosing to say no?"
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.840]   That's where we should put a lot of energy.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.460]   And this is where schools, for example, being very aggressive about, "We really don't allow
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:42.260]   phones and we really do not think that kids should have access to social media until they
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.260]   get to this age."
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.980]   And this is where we should be really clear about it matters.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:49.460]   They're not going to change every mind, but if you change 20% of the mind, you can reduce
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:55.080]   the negative cost of not using and therefore free people from the collective trap.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.860]   This is where I think cultural suggestions like the current surge in general saying,
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:03.940]   "You should be 16 before you have unrestricted access to the internet and in particular social
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:04.940]   media."
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:09.380]   This is where this is really important because individual students otherwise get stuck into
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:12.380]   this collective trap where everyone is unhappy and they can't get out of it.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:15.780]   So one way to break the trap is to say, "Okay, let's spring it.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:19.080]   No one can use this until they're older."
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:25.900]   And we've massively increased the positive utility of everyone's experience.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:29.980]   There's other places where we see these collective traps or inefficient equilibriums at play
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.940]   in tech and society.
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.500]   The place that I have highlighted often in my work is email in the workplace.
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:40.820]   For various reasons, we stumbled into this collaboration style that in my book, "A World
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:45.620]   Without Email," I call the hyperactive high find where everything is worked out with ad
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.760]   hoc back and forth messaging.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:53.620]   This causes huge amounts of problems that I detail often on the show and in my book.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.620]   Why does this persist however if it makes people so miserable?
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.780]   Well, it is an inefficient equilibrium.
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:01.100]   It's a collective trap.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:05.140]   If this is how everyone is organizing their work at my office, which is back and forth
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:10.780]   ad hoc emails, me leaving this unilaterally is going to make things even worse for me
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.180]   because now I'm slowing up decisions.
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:14.180]   People are mad at me.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.580]   My job might be in jeopardy.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:19.460]   So the cost of me leaving the hyperactive hive mind by myself is even worse.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.420]   So I just stick there.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:26.420]   The only way to spring the trap in this context is to have the organization itself come in
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:27.740]   and say, "Enough.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.740]   We don't collaborate with back and forth email.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.600]   Email is for delivering documents.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.580]   Email is for questions that can be answered with one message.
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.260]   Everything else, here's how we do it."
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:44.420]   You have to get everyone out of the trap together or we all stay mired in it forever.
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:49.540]   And so I think collective traps are an important way of understanding techno-social behaviors,
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:53.260]   especially with a techno-social behavior where we all kind of agree this is bad and it's
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:54.780]   making us unhappy.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.820]   But no one seems to be able to easily leave it.
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.300]   This often is the explanation going on.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.600]   So this particular paper, again, "When Products Markets Become Collective Traps, the Case
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.300]   for Social Media," interesting paper.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.840]   I think they're touching on something that is true.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.020]   For years now, I've been trying to teach audiences about inefficient Nash Equilibriums
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.780]   as an explanation for some of these collective behaviors we see.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.660]   So I'm glad there's actually some mathematics now.
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.340]   There's some experimental economics as well that says maybe I was onto something.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:21.340]   All right.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:24.700]   So that's all the time we have for today.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:28.180]   Thank you for listening or watching.
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:32.420]   Remember, leave a positive review if you like it because we know that helps other people
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.420]   discover it.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:37.740]   We'll be back next week for our Halloween episode of the show.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:40.540]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:46.580]   Hey, so if you liked today's episode about playing the long game, I think you might also
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:53.780]   like episode 254, which is called "The Laws of Less," where we get into how some of the
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:59.660]   most interesting, impactful, and happy people in the world systematically try to reduce
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.340]   the number of things they're working on.
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:02.740]   I think you'll like it.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.740]   Check it out.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.460]   So let's make that today's deep question.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.740]   Why should I do less?
