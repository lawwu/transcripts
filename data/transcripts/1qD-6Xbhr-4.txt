[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   the AI landscape shifting yet again, Microsoft just did
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.440]   another one of these shadow aqua hires this time of inflection
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.960]   AI bizarre deal for background inflection have raised 1.5
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.760]   billion over the last two years. It was one of these giant
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.360]   fundings that occurred to build a foundational model.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.520]   This was a bailout of the investors. I don't think the
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.280]   investors got ripped off here. I think the investors were like
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.880]   thrilled to get their money back for whatever reason. This company
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.680]   wasn't going anywhere. It raised hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.080]   Reed and bill obviously are wired in there on the Microsoft
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.200]   board. And this company did have some talent that Microsoft
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.760]   wanted. So they basically did a giant aqua hire and a build out
