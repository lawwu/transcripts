[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   We apologise for the poor quality during the early part of this sermon.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.120]   This was due to the deterioration of the original master tape,
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.360]   and we hope it doesn't spoil your enjoyment of this message by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:23.200]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 5, verses 22, 23 and 24.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:33.040]   Verses 22, 23 and 24 in the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.200]   Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.720]   wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:01.440]   as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.480]   We come, as most of you will realise this morning, to a more detailed consideration
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:17.040]   of the teaching of this passage. In other words, the teaching of the New Testament and of the Bible
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:26.080]   with regard to marriage. Last Sunday morning we looked at it in general, we introduced the subject
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.000]   because we had to do that in the light of the manner in which the apostle presents it to us.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.160]   It is essential we should bear all that in mind. The spirit in which we approach this is important.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.840]   Everything that is done in the realm of the church is different from what is done outside.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.280]   The world has its debating societies, and they can debate the subject of marriage.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.680]   Of course, they do so in a particular way and manner. The two sides, for and against,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.120]   and the supporters and partisans, we are accustomed to all that. But that is not how
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.680]   the church faces a problem. It does not face any problem like that. Here we are confronted by
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.760]   this authority which we have in the Word. We are not concerned to express our own opinions.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.880]   Our one purpose is to understand the teaching of the Word. So we all come together, not one group
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:34.160]   and another, opposition and government, as it were, defence and attack, no, but we all come together
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.120]   in order to discover the teaching of the Holy Scripture. And we saw that certain great principles
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.720]   were laid down so clearly that all this is at once lifted up to the level of Christian doctrine
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.160]   at its highest. We are confronted by some of the most profound teachings found anywhere in
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.680]   the Scriptures concerning the nature of the Christian church. Now then, having looked at
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.440]   those general principles, we can proceed to the particular application. And you notice the first
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:18.400]   thing is, therefore, an injunction which is given to wives. You remember, we reminded one another
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.800]   last Sunday morning, that the wives are put before the husbands for one reason only, that the apostle
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.160]   is dealing with a question of submission. The principle was in verse 21, "Submitting yourselves
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.760]   one to another in the fear of Christ." That's to all members of the church. That is to be the
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.080]   general principle governing all our life and activity, submitting yourselves one to another
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.520]   in the fear of Christ. Now then, in this matter of submission, he says, first of all, wives,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:04:05.520]   submit yourselves or be subject to your own husbands as unto the Lord. Very well, we inevitably
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:16.000]   see, therefore, that the matter we've got to consider is this submission of wives to husbands.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.080]   The apostle is not only reminding them of that, but he is telling them very plainly and very
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:30.240]   clearly that it is their duty to do this, as it is the duty of all of us to submit ourselves
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.640]   one to another. This is a very special thing, he says. So wives, submit yourselves unto your own
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.520]   husbands. This is still more obvious, because they are your husbands, your own husbands,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.120]   and because of the teaching with respect to the whole position of marriage. And the big point,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:56.480]   he says, that emerges here is this question of submission. That is the thing that he's emphasising,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.120]   and therefore we must look into this. Unfortunately, the apostle helps us to do so.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.640]   You see, it isn't just an injunction thrown out. The Scripture never does that. It always gives us
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:18.080]   reasons, supplies us with motives, helps us to understand exactly what we're doing,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.960]   why we should be doing it, and therefore creates within us, if we approach it properly,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   a desire to do this, and gives us a great delight in doing it. Now then, let's look at it.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.280]   He gives us, first of all, a great motive for doing this. Wives, submit yourselves unto your
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:47.360]   own husbands, as unto the Lord. Now, we must be clear about this phrase. It can be and has been
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.760]   misunderstood. It doesn't mean this. It doesn't mean, wives, submit yourselves unto your own
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.800]   husbands in exactly the same way as you submit yourselves unto the Lord. It doesn't mean this.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.720]   That's going too far. The submission of every wife, and indeed of every Christian believer,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:14.640]   male or female, to the Lord Jesus Christ is an absolute one. The apostle doesn't say that
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:21.840]   about the relationship of the wives to the husbands. We are all the bond slaves of Jesus Christ,
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:29.280]   the slaves of Christ. But a wife is never told to be the slave of her husband.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.640]   Our relationship to the Lord is one, I say, of complete, entire, absolute submission.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.120]   Wives are not exalted to do that. Well, what does it mean? Well, what it means is this.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:54.320]   Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, because it is a part of your duty to the Lord,
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.640]   because it is an expression of your submission to the Lord. Wives, submit yourselves to your
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:07.440]   own husbands. Well, now, do it in this way. Do it as a part of your submission to the Lord.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.560]   In other words, you're not doing it only for the husband. You're doing it, indeed, primarily
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.800]   for the Lord himself. It is a repetition of that general point he makes in verse 21,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:26.160]   submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ. Very well. You don't do it in the last
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.640]   analysis for the husband's sake, although you do it for his sake. But the ultimate reason and motive
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:42.160]   is not the husband, but as unto the Lord. You're doing it for Christ's sake. You're doing it
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.440]   because you know that he desires you to do it, because it is well-pleasing in his sight that
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:54.240]   you should be doing it. It is a part of your Christian behavior. It is a part of your whole
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:02.320]   discipleship. Whether he eat or drink, says the apostle, using the same sort of argument
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.920]   in writing to the Corinthians in the first epistle in chapter 10, whether he eat or drink
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:15.280]   or whatsoever he do, do it as unto the Lord. That's it. Everything we do is done for his sake,
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:22.640]   to please him, because we know that he would have us do this. Now then, here I think is something
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.720]   very important at the beginning, which lifts this up, you see, from the realm of controversy,
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:36.240]   and enables us to approach it in the right spirit. If you are anxious, he says, in other words,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.280]   to please the Lord Jesus Christ and to carry out his behests and his will,
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:50.080]   submit yourselves unto your own husband. Now, there can be no more compelling motive
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:57.840]   for any action than that. And if every Christian wife today is concerned above everything else to
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.720]   please the Lord Jesus Christ, she will find no difficulty in this paragraph. Indeed, it will
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:13.520]   be her greatest delight to do what the apostle tells us here. I would go further. Never, perhaps,
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.160]   have we as Christian people had a greater opportunity of showing what Christianity really
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:27.360]   means than just at this present time, when the life of the world is becoming more and more obvious
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:35.040]   for what it is. When it is becoming increasingly chaotic in this marriage respect and marriage
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:41.760]   relationship and in every other respect, here is a glorious opportunity for us to show the difference
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.680]   it makes to be a Christian. So, Christian wives, says the apostle,
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.280]   you've got a wonderful opportunity. You can show that you're no longer pagans,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.600]   that you're no longer irreligious, that you no longer belong to the world. And these other people,
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.240]   living as they do, asserting their own rights and displaying their arrogance and leading to
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.560]   all the chaos that characterizes life, when they look at you, they'll see something so different,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.560]   they'll say, "Well, what is this? Why do you behave like this? What's the reason for it?
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.960]   And your only reason is this, not to, 'Well, I just happen to be born like this.' No, no,
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.480]   I am behaving like this because it is the will of my Lord." You immediately get an opportunity
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.880]   for preaching and stating the gospel. That's why the apostle is exalting them.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.120]   His whole exhortation, as we've seen in the whole of this chapter and most of the previous chapter,
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.480]   the point of the exhortation is that these Christian people are to show in their lives
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:47.680]   in every detail that once you become a Christian, you are different in every respect.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:56.800]   And this great characteristic of Christian living can be displayed by the wives submitting
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.040]   themselves to their own husband. Very well, there is the grand motive. And unless we are moved by
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.240]   that and animated by that, well, it's obvious, of course, that no argument will appeal to us at all.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:15.920]   If we are not already submitted to the Lord Jesus Christ and concerned about his name and his honor
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.720]   above everything else, all other arguments will leave us untouched. So the apostle puts that first,
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   and we have to put it first. But having said that, he then goes on to give us particular reasons,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.640]   additional reasons. And here again one cannot refrain from commenting upon the wealth and the
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.400]   glory of the scripture. Do you want particular reasons for doing this? Well, let me give you
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:48.240]   them as the apostle puts them before us. There are two great subsidiary reasons, he says, why every
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   Christian wife should submit herself to her own husband. The first is what we may well call the
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:07.440]   order of nature. And the second is, of course, that this is something which belongs to the realm
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:14.480]   of the relationship of the church to the Lord Jesus Christ. But now let's look at this first
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:21.920]   reason. They're both in the 23rd verse. For, because, here's the argument, because the husband
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:31.520]   is the head of the world. The second reason is, even as Christ is the head of the church,
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.920]   and he is the savior of the body. Now let's look at this first reason.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:42.000]   I say the first reason that the apostle gives the wives for submitting themselves
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   unto their own husbands is that this is a part of the order of creation.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:55.120]   It is a part, if you like, of God's ordinance, of God's decree, of God's will, of what God has
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:02.800]   stated with regard to this relationship of men and women. Now, it was in order to bring out this
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.920]   teaching that we read together at the beginning those various portions of scripture. You see,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.840]   in that second chapter of Genesis, you go right back to the creation. And you've noticed how
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:22.000]   the other references in the New Testament all went back to that. Now that's what I mean by
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.720]   saying that it belongs to the order of creation. Before you come to consider marriage from the
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:34.320]   specifically Christian standpoint, you must go further back, because the New Testament sends
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.840]   you back. It sends you back to this book of Genesis and to the whole question of creation.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:48.400]   It also refers us to the question of the fall. I didn't read that portion from the third chapter
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.160]   of Genesis, but the crucial verse, of course, is the 16th verse of the third chapter of Genesis,
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:02.080]   which tells us what God said to the woman as the result of her listening to Satan and his temptation
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:09.600]   and her eating of the forbidden fruit. Unto the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:18.080]   and thy conception. In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, and thy desire shall be to thy
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:27.440]   husband, and he shall rule over thee." Now that is an addition, you notice, and we must pay
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:36.000]   careful attention to it. Now let us try to summarize what the teaching of the Scripture is,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   therefore, concerning this most important matter of marriage and of the family. Let me try to
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.160]   extract the principles that are put before us in these various portions of Scripture.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:15:00.000]   They surely are these. First, and remember we are dealing essentially with marriage this morning.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.480]   I'm not dealing in particular with the status of woman as such, of all women. The Scriptures
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.480]   are dealing with the married relationship of husbands and wives. We have to deduce from
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.000]   the Scripture the teaching with regard to woman in general. You may say the whole question of
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.640]   women in professions and things like that. I'm not really dealing with that at all this morning.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.560]   We're dealing only with the question of marriage. That's what the Apostle is talking about. He's
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.280]   addressing wives. He's not addressing unmarried women here. There is teaching about that,
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.840]   but it doesn't come within our province this morning, except indirectly. Very well,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:42.000]   what is the teaching? It is this. First, you notice that the emphasis is put constantly
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   upon the fact that man was created first, not the woman. You notice how the Apostles used that
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.800]   argument. Man was created first, from which they deduced a priority for men. They emphasized the
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:07.840]   fact also that woman was made out of the men, taken out of the men, and meant to be a help for
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:14.000]   men. A help for men that was meat for him. None of the animals were that, says the Scriptures.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.320]   Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field,
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:26.960]   but for Adam there was not found an help meat for him. And it was because there was no help
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:34.160]   meat for men amongst the animals that woman was created. Now, that is the basic teaching.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.520]   And you notice that the Apostles lay great stress upon that fact. Very well,
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:47.840]   man then was created first. But not only that, man was made the Lord of creation.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:56.480]   It was to men that this authority was given over the brute and animal creation. It was men who
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.880]   were called upon to give names. Here you see are indications of men being put into a position of
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:10.160]   leadership, lordship, and authority and power. He takes the decisions. He gives these rulings.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.280]   Now that is the fundamental teaching with regard to this whole matter.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:21.040]   Then the Apostle Peter, you remember, underlines all this in that significant phrase of his where
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.800]   he tells the husbands to give honor to the wife as unto the weaker vessel.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.440]   Now what does he mean by weaker vessel? Well, clearly what he means is what is taught
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.880]   so plainly in these early chapters of Genesis and indeed everywhere in the Bible.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:48.720]   It means primarily this whole question of men's headship and leadership. Men, physically speaking,
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:54.400]   is naturally stronger than women. He was made to be such and he is such.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.040]   I could enter into this in great detail. I'm not going to do so. But I could establish all this
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.800]   with extreme ease, not merely from the standpoint of anatomy but still more from the standpoint of
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:16.160]   physiology. Woman was not meant to be as strong as men, physically, nervously, and in many other
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.840]   respects. She is constituted in a different manner. And when the Apostle says that she is the weaker
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:29.520]   vessel, he is not speaking in any derogatory sense at all. All he is saying is that she is essentially
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:36.000]   different and that man is always to remember that. He mustn't treat the woman as if she were his equal
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.760]   in these respects. He must remember that she has been made differently and that he is to respect
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.200]   her and to honor her and to guard her and to protect her accordingly. Very well then, here is
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:56.880]   this basic fundamental teaching. The man is to be the head of the wife and he is to be the head of
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:04.080]   the family. God made him in that way, endowed him with faculties and powers and propensities
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:10.640]   that enable him to do this, and so made woman that she should be the complement of men.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.520]   Now, the word "complement" carries that notion of supplement, you see.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:21.200]   That man, as it were, is not complete without woman, that's why these two become one flesh.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:29.760]   Woman is the complement of men. But the emphasis, therefore, is this, that man is responsible not
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:37.920]   only for himself but for his wife and for his family in all ultimate matters. And the wife is
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:47.200]   to help him, to support him, to aid him, to do everything she can in order to enable him to
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:53.840]   function as the Lord of creation into which position God has placed him. She is brought
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:20:00.320]   into being in order to help men to perform that great and wonderful and glorious task.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:07.520]   Now, then, there is this basic teaching with regard to the relationship of husbands and wives,
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:14.960]   as laid down in the very order of creation, in the most fundamental rules with regard to
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.800]   the life of men in this world. But we've got to make an addition.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:26.880]   There, you see, it is before the fall. While men and women were still perfect,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.040]   while they were still in paradise, without any sin, without any defect in them at all,
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:40.640]   that was how God ordained it. But unfortunately, something happened, the fall.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:49.200]   And here, you see, is a point which is made very especially by the Apostle Paul in that first
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.520]   epistle of his to Timothy in the second chapter, and verses 11 to 15 at the end, the section I read
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:03.600]   to you. You notice that the Apostle makes a great deal of the point that it was the woman
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:14.080]   who was deceived and fell, and not the man. So the fall has made a difference. Indeed,
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.200]   Genesis 3.16 does establish that. Let me read it to you again. "And to the woman he said,
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:26.080]   'Now because of what you've done, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception,
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:32.320]   from which one can but deduce that childbirth would probably have been painless, were it not
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:40.720]   for sin and the fall. In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, but for our purpose this morning,
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:47.920]   thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.'" There's something further there.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:55.440]   It's not only reiterating the lordship and the leadership and the headship already established
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:03.440]   before the fall, it is underlining it. "He shall rule over thee." There is a new factor here,
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:12.080]   woman's subordination to men has been increased as the result of the fall. Now, it is arguable
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:23.120]   that this edict was promulgated for this reason. That the very essence, you see, of the fall,
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:30.240]   of what happened to Eve, was this. That Eve, being confronted by the insinuation and by the
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   suggestion of the devil, instead of doing what she should have done, what she'd been made to do and
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:42.080]   been taught to do, namely, to go to Adam and consult him about the question, took the decision
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.680]   upon herself. She put herself into the position of leadership. She dealt with the situation,
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.400]   and as the result of her dealing with the situation, instead of taking it to Adam as
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:58.960]   she should have done, she fell. She involved him in the fall likewise, and the whole human race fell.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:07.360]   So that in a sense, the original sin was that woman failed to realize her place and her position in
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:16.080]   the married relationship, usurped authority and power and position, and therefore brought calamity
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:25.040]   and chaos to pass. Now, that is not only stated in Genesis 3, 16. It is the whole basis of the
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.840]   apostle's argument with regard to women taking authority and teaching and preaching, and things
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:35.760]   like that, in the first epistle to Timothy in the second chapter. And he puts it specifically in
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:41.600]   terms of the relationship of wives and of husbands. Well, now there is the teaching in its essence.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:48.800]   But at once, I know that there is an objection. And the objection, of course, that one reads
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:58.480]   and hears so frequently, and alas, from evangelical people who claim to believe the scriptures
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:05.520]   as the infallible inspired word of God, even from them, what one hears so often is this,
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:11.440]   "Ah, but that's only Paul's view. That's only the view of the apostle Paul." He was obviously
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:20.560]   an anti-feminist. And he was a man who had adopted the view that was so commonly taken of women
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.760]   at that time. You are familiar with the argument. That's how it's said. Then,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.440]   women was in a very debased position. And everybody throughout the world then held that view.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:37.600]   Women was but goods, as it were, and a slave, and so on. And this was true even of the Jews,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.320]   and the apostle was just a typical rabbinical Jew. Now, of course, I'm not surprised that people
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.520]   who don't believe the scripture as the word of God say things like that. They, of course,
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.320]   and they're doing it in London today, from Christian pulpits, so-called, they don't hesitate
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.120]   to say not only that Paul was wrong, but that the Lord Jesus Christ was wrong. They are the
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:02.960]   authority. They know. They understand. Well, I don't argue with people like that. I just say
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.440]   that I can't have any discussion with them at all, because it's not a question of putting up my
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:13.520]   opinion against theirs. That's just not Christian. There's nothing else to say about it. It's not
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.000]   Christian at all. The Christian is a man who submits himself entirely to this revelation.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.240]   He knows nothing apart from this. So, when we hear this argument,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:28.720]   we not only bemoan it and regret it, but we have to answer it, and we answer it like this.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:36.640]   It's perfectly true to say that the view of women at the time of our Lord and of the apostle Paul
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:44.480]   was debased, speaking generally. But it wasn't the Jews' view, because they had these scriptures
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:52.160]   and believed them. And it most certainly was not the apostle Paul's view. Did you notice what he
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.560]   said there in 1 Corinthians 11? He said, "Neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:03.680]   the woman." It was this great apostle of all who gloried in the fact that in Christ Jesus,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:12.160]   there was neither barbarian, nor Scythian, bond nor free, male nor female. It was a great part
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.640]   of his preaching of the gospel to say, "Look here, in this matter of salvation, men and women
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:24.320]   are equal. And woman has an equal chance in salvation with man." He gloried in that. And
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:30.160]   there is no man who speaks more delicately or more gloriously about womanhood and the
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:38.000]   true glory of womanhood than the apostle Paul. And you notice that he doesn't stop at just
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.840]   giving us an account of the duty of the wife toward the husband. He always tells us about
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:50.160]   the duty of the husband to the wife. And he shows that the Christian husband's view of womanhood
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.960]   and of woman and of his wife is more exalted than anything the world has ever heard.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:02.400]   It puts everything into its right position. He always gives us, I say, the two sides,
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:10.240]   but apart from all that. Didn't you notice as I read the quotations that the apostle never
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:17.360]   puts these things forward as his own opinion? He always goes back to Genesis. He always goes
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.960]   back to the order of creation. He says, "It isn't my opinion, this." He says, "This is what God has
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:29.120]   laid down." And the apostle's only concern is that the truth of God should be known,
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.040]   and that what God ordained should be put constantly into practice.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:40.240]   So this tendency to say it's only Paul's opinion is, you know, a denial of the Scripture. Now,
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:45.600]   my friend, you've got to be clear about this. If you say that you believe that the Bible is
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.160]   the infallible and inspired Word of God, well, then you must not speak like that about the
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:56.480]   apostle Paul. Because when he writes, he not only quotes the Scripture, but he writes as an inspired
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:01.680]   apostle. When he gives his own opinion, he's always careful to tell you that. And if he doesn't
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:07.920]   say it's his own opinion, well, then it is inspired. You remember Peter tells his readers to
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:13.120]   listen to the apostle Paul, even as they do to the other Scriptures. He says there are some people
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.880]   who rest his arguments and his writings, even as they do the other Scriptures also. What Paul
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.240]   writes is Scripture. And you're not arguing with Paul, you are arguing with God. You are
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:31.200]   arguing with the Holy Ghost. What Paul writes is Scripture. And you're not arguing with Paul,
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.640]   you are arguing with God. You are arguing with the Holy Ghost. And at the same time,
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:42.000]   you're putting yourself into a contradictory position of saying that you believe the Bible
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.160]   only as long as it doesn't contradict what you happen to believe, because you're a creature
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.920]   of the 20th century. And that is a denial of a belief in the authority of the Scripture.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.720]   Very well, then, having dealt with that foolish objection, and there is nothing that I know of
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:04.160]   that is more foolish than such talk. Let me sum it up again. Woman, then, according to this, the wife
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:15.760]   is in this position. To be subject to her husband does not mean that she is the slave of her
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:24.080]   husband. It doesn't mean that she is inferior to her husband as such. It doesn't mean that for a
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:31.680]   moment. We shall see this still more clearly when we come to consider what the apostle says about
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.440]   the duty of the husband to the wife. What is he saying, then? Well, what he's saying is this,
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:42.000]   that the woman is different, that she is the complement of the man,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:49.120]   and that what he does prohibit is that a woman should seek to be manly, or that a woman should
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.840]   seek to behave as a man, or that a woman should seek to usurp the place and the position of the
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:30:01.520]   power which have been given to men by God himself. That's all he's saying. It isn't slavery,
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:07.920]   but he's exhorting them to realize what God has ordained. Therefore, the wife should rejoice in
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:14.240]   her gifts, she should rejoice in her position. She's been made by God to help men to function
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:20.080]   as God's representative in this world. She is to be the homemaker, the mother, the helper of men,
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:25.680]   his comforter, his guide, the one to whom he can speak and look for comfort and encouragement.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:32.000]   She's a helpmeet for men, men who realize the truth about himself. She realizes the truth,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.840]   and thus she comes and compliments him and helps him and aids him, and together they are living
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:43.120]   to the glory of God and to the Lord Jesus Christ. I wonder whether an illustration will help at this
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:50.480]   point. You see, the idea of leadership or headship seems to be the thing that stumbles people,
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:57.680]   because they seem to think that that of necessity carries the idea of an inherent and essential
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.000]   inferiority. It does nothing of the sort. Let me give you an illustration, therefore.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.640]   This whole headship of the man, the husband in the married relationship,
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:17.440]   is comparable in many ways to that of troops to their leader. Now, an army would be completely
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.520]   chaotic if everybody had the right to decide what's going to be done next. No, the moment a
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:29.200]   man joins an armed force, he is subjecting himself. He is saying he's going to obey the command that
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:35.040]   comes down to him, whatever he may think of it. It is his business to do it. He is granting this
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:40.320]   right of command to the one who is set above him, and though he may have his own ideas and opinions,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:46.560]   it doesn't matter. He now forgoes all that he submits and he subject him. That's one illustration.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:51.440]   Or, if you like, take a number of men in a team playing football or cricket.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:57.760]   The first thing they have to do is to appoint a captain. They're not all captains. If they did,
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.880]   they'd never win a match. The first thing they do is to appoint one amongst themselves as a captain.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.640]   He may not even be the best player in the team, but they decide that on the whole he's got the
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.200]   greatest gifts of leadership. So they put him into the position of captain, and having done that,
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.760]   they've got to submit themselves to him. If they don't, chaos has returned again.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:22.080]   Or imagine a committee being appointed to consider a subject. A number of men are appointed. What is
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.360]   the first thing they do? Well, they say the first thing we must do is to appoint a chairman.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.880]   Of course. Why? Well, you must have some authority. You can't transact business unless
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.600]   there's a chair to address and someone there, and you've got to abide by the ruling of the chairman.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.960]   It's the appointing of a chairman. Again, you see, the question of inferiority doesn't come in.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.600]   What it means is this, that in order to do this thing efficiently, you must have a leader. Take
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.560]   the House of Commons. What is the first thing they do? Well, they have to appoint a speaker,
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.120]   and the business of the speaker is just to sit in the chair and exercise control.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:00.160]   He gives his rulings. Again, it doesn't mean for a moment he's the greatest man in the House of
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.960]   Commons and that they're all inferior to him. No, but in their wisdom, and because business can't
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.920]   be transacted apart from this, they must set someone in this position of authority.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.640]   And all the Bible teaches is this, that God has set man, the husband, in that position.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.960]   So he says to the wives, "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands."
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.440]   For that reason, he has been appointed the head.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.080]   But there is a still greater argument. Did you notice it in 1 Corinthians 11?
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:36.800]   The argument is this, that the man, the husband, is the head of the wife.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:45.360]   Yes, and Christ is the head of the man. Yes, and God is the head of Christ.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:53.760]   That's the argument that can't be answered. In what sense is God the head of Christ?
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.960]   Well, it's what we sometimes call the economic trinity, isn't it?
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.120]   The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are co-equal and co-eternal.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:06.240]   Well, how can the Father God be the head of Christ? Oh, for the purpose of salvation.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:13.120]   The Son has subordinated himself to the Father, and the Spirit has subordinated himself to the
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.800]   Son and to the Father. It is a voluntary subordination. Why? In order that salvation
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.360]   may be carried out. It is voluntary. It is essential in the carrying out of the work.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:30.160]   The Son said, "Here I am, send me." He volunteered. He resigns this aspect of equality.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:36.400]   He becomes the servant of his Father, and the Father sends him. The head of Christ is God.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:45.680]   Now then, wives, that is the way in which the apostle puts it. As the head of Christ is God,
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:52.640]   so Christ is the head of the man, and so the man is the head of the woman. Therefore, wives,
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:59.280]   submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:07.680]   Now there is a positive exposition of this tremendous, amazing teaching,
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.760]   which alone, of course, gives us a true view of marriage.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:18.560]   I trust that incidentally I have been dealing with an argument, a foolish argument again,
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.480]   that is so often brought forward. But somebody says, "You know, this is quite wrong. I know
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.520]   many instances where the wife is a much abler person than the husband, much more gifted in
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.240]   every respect. And are you saying that a brilliant, gifted woman like this has got to subject herself
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.800]   to her husband, to a man who is altogether inferior to her?" Well, now there is only one
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:44.560]   answer to that, of course. That you are arguing against God. God knows all about things like that.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:50.560]   What God is saying is this, that if that gifted, brilliant woman is not subjecting herself to her
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:59.280]   own husband, she is sinning. Whatever the gifts, she is to do that. On which I would make two
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:10.080]   comments. No woman, whatever her gifts, has a right even to contemplate marrying a given individual
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:17.040]   unless she is prepared to submit in that way. This voluntary submission, the way in which Christ
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.960]   submitted and subordinated himself, she is to do that. And unless she is prepared to do it,
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.800]   unless she is convinced that she can thus submit herself to this man, she should not marry him.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:35.840]   If she goes into it with any other idea, it is against the will of God. She is committing sin.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:45.360]   My second comment would be this. I think one of the most wonderful things I have ever been
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:51.120]   privileged to witness in my life was just that very thing to which I am referring,
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:57.600]   actually being put into practice. It was my custom for a number of years to go and preach
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:04.560]   in a certain church in the provinces and to spend the night after preaching twice always in the
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:12.960]   manse with the minister and his wife. And it was interesting to me for this reason, that
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:19.520]   it was obvious to me on the first visit that from the sheer standpoint of ability,
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:25.280]   there was no comparison between the husband and the wife. The wife was an exceptionally
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:32.800]   able and brilliant woman. The husband was not without his gifts, but his main gifts were in
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:38.160]   personality, and exceptionally nice and friendly and kind and gracious men.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:44.480]   But from sheer intellectual ability, there was no comparison. Indeed, their very academic record,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.800]   they were both graduates, their very academic records had proved this. The woman had taken
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.200]   a degree in a subject that very few women took up at that particular time, and she had taken
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.240]   the first class honors. The husband, taking a much easier subject, had only had a second class.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.560]   Now, there was no question, I say, as to the ability, her grasp, her understanding,
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.200]   her everything. It struck you immediately and became more and more clear as I got to know them.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:13.120]   But this was the thing. I say, I don't know that I've ever seen anything more wonderful
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:20.000]   than the way in which that woman always put her husband into this scriptural position.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.160]   She did it in a very clever and in a very subtle way. She used to put arguments into his mouth,
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:33.600]   but she always put it in this way, as if he'd said it, not her. Well, all right. All right.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.720]   There is that amusing aspect to it, but I'm reporting it to you as one of the most moving
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:46.880]   and tremendous things I've ever experienced. She was not only an able woman, she was a Christian
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:54.480]   woman, you see, and she was putting this principle into operation. The husband is the head.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:01.120]   He always had to stake the decision. She'd supplied him with the reasons. She'd shown him
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:05.920]   what the decision inevitably was, but she was acting as a help meat for him. She'd got these
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.640]   qualities that he lacked. She was complimenting. She was supplementing. She was really doing this
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.920]   very thing. And the husband was the head, and the children were referred to him. She was guarding
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:22.000]   his position. And I say it is one of the most wonderful things that I've ever been privileged
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:29.360]   to see and to witness. Let me therefore, in a closing word, show you the importance of realising
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:37.680]   and grasping and understanding this teaching. Why is this all so important, and especially today?
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.960]   Let me put it still more like this. Why is it more important that I should have been doing
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.840]   what I've been doing this morning, rather than give you my opinion on the position in Algeria?
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:57.920]   Well, I'll tell you. It is the failure to understand and to implement this very teaching
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:03.120]   that is causing most of the problems in the world today. What is the basic problem in the world
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:09.840]   today? It is the problem of authority. The chaos in the world today is due to the fact that people
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.200]   in every realm and department of life have lost all respect for authority.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:20.640]   Whether it be between nations or between parts of nations, whether it be in industry, whether it be
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.760]   in the home, whether it be in the schools or anywhere else, it's the loss of authority.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.120]   And I verily believe this, that it rarely starts in the home and in the married relationship.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:38.400]   That is why I venture to say that no statesman whose own marriage has broken down has really a
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.840]   right to speak about these problems. If he fails in the sphere where he's most competent,
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.040]   what right has he to speak in other? He ought to retire out of public life.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:54.960]   Because the real breakdown starts in the home and in the married relationship.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:02.400]   And I am asserting that the appalling increase in divorce which has taken place since the war—I'm
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.560]   told it's going down a little at the moment, but I suggest to you that that's only temporary and
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.760]   can be explained statistically—but the appalling increase in divorce since the war is due to one
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:17.840]   thing only, that men and women don't understand this scriptural teaching about marriage and about
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:26.080]   husbands and wives. It is also the explanation of the breakdown in family and in home life,
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:36.160]   which is again so obvious at the present time. The family is ceasing to be the centre that it was,
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.800]   and everybody's out somewhere and out at all hours of the night.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:43.200]   Family life, this cohesion, this unit, is disappearing.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.200]   It is also the explanation of the unruliness and the indiscipline
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:56.720]   amongst children. It is the main explanation of juvenile delinquency. Do you know that this can
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.560]   be proved even from statistics? These poor children who become delinquents are almost
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:08.240]   invariably the children of broken homes, broken marriages. Why? Well, the poor children have
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:14.080]   never been given a chance. You see, they've been brought up in an atmosphere of uncertainty and
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:20.320]   indecision. They've been brought up in an atmosphere of conflict, where wife is against husband and
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:25.280]   husband against wife, and they become cynics in their tender years. They have no respect for
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:30.320]   either or for anybody or anything. The place where a child should have confidence and should be able
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.200]   to look up for authority and leadership and guidance has gone. There's nothing there,
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:40.560]   and the poor child becomes a delinquent. He has been brought up in this atmosphere of conflict
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:47.440]   between father and mother, husband and wife. And indeed, there are other aspects of this
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.360]   that seem to me to be even more sinister.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:43:02.560]   Isn't it a fact that increasingly men have been abrogating this position and retiring out of it
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:08.960]   and not doing their duty as husbands and as fathers? In sheer laziness and in sheer selfishness,
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:15.600]   husbands are increasingly leaving it to the wife, leaving it to the mother. "Can't be bothered,
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.880]   comes home tired. Take the children, keep them from me, you answer them." Isn't this increasingly
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:26.800]   happening? The husband is deliberately vacating the position in which God has put him. It's
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:32.640]   happening amongst Christian people, but it's happening still more amongst the non-Christian.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.960]   The husband is evacuating his own position, leaving it in his laziness to the wife. This is
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.640]   happening in many directions, of course. So many Christian people today won't touch politics,
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:48.240]   they say. Dirty game. But what an appalling argument. It's their duty to, as citizens of
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.040]   the country. But here it is particularly in this realm. Then on the other side, of course,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:59.520]   feminism has led to an aggressiveness on the part of the wife, the woman, the mother.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:04.960]   She is setting herself up as the authority and undermining the influence of the father in the
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:10.160]   minds of the children, because she wants to have it all. This totally false and wrong approach to
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:19.280]   the whole position. Now I don't say this in a spirit of criticism. We are seeing this a great
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.040]   deal in this country, but nothing like the extent to which they're seeing it in the United States
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:29.600]   of America. There you have what may more or less be called a matriarchal society.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.800]   And the view of the man is increasingly becoming this. He's just the one to provide the dollars.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.640]   He's just the wage earner. He's the man who brings in the money. The woman, she's the cultured
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.800]   person. She's the head of the home. The children look to her. He's just the man who brings in the
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:48.720]   money. It's a matriarchal society. And it seems to me to be a very dangerous thing.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:55.920]   The result is, of course, that you get crime and all the terrible social problems with which
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.160]   they're grappling in that country. And then as they influence every other country through their
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:06.240]   films and in various other ways, it is being spread throughout the entire world. A matriarchal
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:11.680]   society with the woman as the head and center of the home is a denial of the biblical teaching,
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:17.200]   and is indeed a repetition of the original sin of Eve.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.720]   The problem is, of course, increasingly being recognized.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   That is why you've got to have marriage guidance councils and so on.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:33.360]   But alas, how do they approach them? They approach them in terms of psychology.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:40.160]   And yet if you examined the married life of so many of these psychologists, you'd have a terrible
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.800]   shock. These people give advice as to how marriages are to be entered into, how they're
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:50.000]   to be preserved and kept. They can't do it in their own marriages. Of course they can't.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.160]   It isn't psychology. It isn't a little common sense and wisdom and the spirit of
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.160]   comradeship and give and take. We know all about that. The world knows all about it,
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:05.360]   but it can't practice it. No, no, there is only one hope until God is the authority
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:11.600]   and men and wives submit themselves to him. Unless they do it as unto the Lord and realize
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:16.640]   it's the same sort of headship as that of God over Christ and Christ over men, there is no hope.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:23.600]   And it is as men and women in the last hundred years have increasingly departed from the
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:31.920]   authority of this book that this terrible social blight and problem has become more and more
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:38.720]   evident. I know we are told, "No, no, you want to go back to that stern, repressive, autocratic
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.440]   Victorian husband and father. I want nothing of the sort. I know that a lot of the modern
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.560]   is a reaction against that. I condemn that as much as this. We must come back to the Bible.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:55.440]   I'm not advocating come back to Victorianism. Come back to God. Come back to Christ. Come back
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:03.920]   to the revelation, the authoritative word of God and see his perfect plan, men and the women by
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:09.920]   his side, complimenting him, his help meet, loving one another, revering, respecting,
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:17.920]   honoring one another, but never confusing the two spheres." Well, God willing, we shall go on
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:23.280]   with the consideration of the Apostles' teaching next Sunday morning, but may he in his grace
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   enable us not only to see the teaching but to submit ourselves to it, that thereby we may
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:41.520]   bring honor and glory to the name of our blessed Lord, as unto the Lord. Amen.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:46.480]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
