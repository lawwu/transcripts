[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   Today we venture out on a six-part series related to Christmas, answering your hard
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.560]   questions about the conception and the birth and the childhood of Jesus.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.200]   And we begin today talking about the miraculous conception.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.760]   A question from a listener named Kelly who writes this, "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.280]   Every Christmas I'm left wondering about the angel that came to Mary and informed her that
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.260]   she would have a child by the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.080]   She wondered how it would be, and I know nothing is impossible for God.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.720]   So here's my question.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.480]   Did God become a fertilized embryo which was implanted into Mary's womb, or did Jesus somehow
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.120]   combine with Mary's natural egg to create the God-man?
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.480]   Are we given any biblical clues here as to how this happened biologically?"
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:03.480]   Let's read the most important section in the Gospel of Luke about the conception of Christ
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.520]   in Mary's womb and see how much God has revealed to us.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.080]   Let me read it.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.380]   This is Luke 1, 30 to 38.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.640]   And the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.120]   And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   Jesus.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.720]   He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.520]   him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever,
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.240]   and of his kingdom there will be no end."
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.980]   And Mary said to the angel, "How will this be, since I am a virgin?"
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.520]   And the angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.840]   High will overshadow you, and therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.440]   Son of God.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.240]   And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.680]   And this is the sixth month with her who was called barren, for nothing will be impossible
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.080]   with God."
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.880]   And Mary said, "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.600]   Let it be to me according to your word."
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.360]   And the angel departed from her.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:40.320]   I think this is as close as we get to the actual description of the event of the incarnation
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:50.840]   of the divine nature in some way uniting with the human nature in the womb of Mary.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.960]   We know from numerous texts in the New Testament that Jesus was God, very God, had a divine
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.960]   nature.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.560]   He had a real divine nature, like Colossians 2.9.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.980]   In his body, there was fullness of deity.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.520]   We know that Jesus Christ also had a human nature, because Paul says there is one mediator
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.640]   between God and man, the man, Christ Jesus.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.720]   So he was a mediator between God and man because he was a man.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.480]   So we know that Jesus was a God-man.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.320]   There were two natures, a divine nature and a human nature in this one person, Jesus Christ.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:45.880]   Now in this passage in Luke 2, the angel says to Mary in verse 31, "Behold, you will conceive
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.760]   in your womb."
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:57.560]   Now the natural way to take this is that Mary provides her ordinary part of the conception
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.800]   process, her egg, and God miraculously in some way—we do not and probably never can
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:15.320]   understand—provides the divine nature of Jesus, of Christ, the Son of God.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:23.840]   Because when she asks how this can be, since she's a virgin, the angel says, "The Holy
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.040]   Spirit will come upon you, and the Most High, the power of the Most High, will overshadow
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.440]   you, and therefore the child to be born will be called Holy, Son of God."
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.320]   In other words, the angel veils the mysterious process in metaphorical language.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.400]   The Most High will overshadow you, like the Shekinah glory.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.880]   One of the reasons that I think we should assume Mary conceived with her own normal
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.000]   egg is that the same word for "conceived" is used in verse 36 when the angel says, "Behold,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.800]   your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son."
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.480]   And this is the same word, and the word "also" so that there's no reason to think anything
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.560]   different than Mary conceived.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.720]   She didn't become pregnant through Joseph.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.200]   She became pregnant through the Holy Spirit in some way that we simply cannot fathom.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:40.240]   So I don't think we should go much farther than that in detailing any of the mechanics
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.840]   of the miraculous conception, and I would give Kelly and the rest of us a caution here
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   and a happy exhortation.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:58.720]   The caution is that we beware of the temptation and the mindset of being excessively fascinated
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.840]   with non-essential matters.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.000]   I have met people—and I'm not saying, Kelly, that you're this kind of person at all, but
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.920]   I've met people like this, I had them in my church for years—I have met people over
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:18.160]   the years who seem to be continually gravitating toward the margins of what is important rather
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.440]   than gravitating toward the center of what is important.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.040]   They love to speculate about things that we cannot know and that are not essential to
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.800]   know, but these marginal things seem to hold an amazing fascination and attraction for
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   them.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.960]   I think that is spiritually dangerous for the soul to be so preoccupied with marginal
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:49.280]   matters while the joy and energy and passion for the center and the glorious main realities
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.960]   often goes languishing.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   So that's my caution.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.120]   Now here's my happy concluding exhortation.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.800]   We are in the presence here in Luke 2, in the presence of one of the greatest mysteries
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.340]   and wonders of the universe.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:15.680]   The Creator of the universe, who is of a completely different dimension and reality
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:25.360]   than what he made, in a way that is scarcely conceivable to us, is united in one person,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:37.360]   Jesus Christ, with a divine and human nature for the central purpose of being able to die.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.000]   God cannot die.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   God cannot die.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.960]   But Jesus Christ, the God-man, can die.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:53.320]   This is the most spectacular fact in the universe, I think, more spectacular than creation itself,
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:03.440]   that God would clothe himself with humanity for the express purpose of dying so that rebellious
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:09.240]   people, people who are in rebellion against him, might live with him in joy forever.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:16.360]   Listen to Hebrews 2.14, "Since the children," that's us, human beings, "Since the children
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:26.800]   share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of that same nature, flesh and blood,
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.880]   that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.640]   and deliver all those who through fear of death were held in lifelong slavery."
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   Amazing.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.600]   "He took on our nature so he could die."
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.040]   So let us stay close to the glorious center.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:54.200]   God took on human nature so that he might die to destroy our enemies, deliver us from
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.480]   slavery to sin, give us eternal life with him forever.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:06.640]   Yes, this is worthy of much meditation this Christmas and every Christmas.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.840]   Wow, what a miracle.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.840]   What a grace.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.840]   What a gift.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.480]   Thank you, Pastor John, for stirring our worship on these central things when it comes to the
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480]   coming of Jesus.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.920]   And, Kelly, thank you for the question.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:24.000]   There are some biological mysteries here that we will never understand on this side of eternity,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.360]   and even more mysterious to me are the divine mysteries at play in the incarnation as well.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.320]   For the fully divine Son and creator of the universe to incarnate as a baby in a barn
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.620]   in Bethlehem, what divine attributes did he lay aside, if any?
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.240]   On Monday, we're going to pick up this next question as we march through some hard questions
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.920]   on our way to Christmas, and that's the next one.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.300]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.960]   As always, thanks for listening to the podcast and have a wonderful weekend.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.460]   Bye.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.460]   [END]
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:07.460]   1. What is the most difficult thing you've ever experienced?
