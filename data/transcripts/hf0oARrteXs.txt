[00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.520]   Hi, this is Abner Chow, one of the translators for the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.520]   Now, I know you're not looking at me, and there are really two reasons for this.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.920]   For one, you're looking at something far better looking, which is the scriptures.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.440]   And second, that relates to the question that has come across my desk.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.160]   And the question kind of goes like this.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.080]   Earlier, you were talking with Dr. MacArthur in a video
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.000]   about the layout of Colossians 115 through 20.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.320]   Could we see that and get more detail on what exactly you meant by that?
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.880]   Now, and I'm just kidding here, I don't know if this is just pure curiosity,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.360]   or if this is a clever way of seeing more of the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.560]   And again, I'm just kidding here quite a bit.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.920]   But in all seriousness, in the end, this is a great opportunity for edification,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.160]   and that is the goal of these videos, and so the question is so worth it.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.840]   And in light of that, let's just think about this together.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.240]   But before jumping in, there is one side note that I should mention,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.760]   which really sets the tone for this entire discussion.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.240]   And that is this, that we often try to memorize things like the Bible
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.840]   through all kinds of mechanisms.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.560]   We use acronyms, we use alliteration,
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.480]   we use rhyming to help us memorize lots of different things, including the Scripture.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.600]   But what I found to be best for learning and memorizing the Bible
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.000]   is to rigorously study it.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.840]   Because when we know what it says, and why it says what it says,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.040]   and why it says what it says in the order that it says it,
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.440]   the Scripture just flows out from our heart,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.880]   because we thoroughly grasp and comprehend it all.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.000]   That's the best way to memorize the Scripture, is to thoroughly learn it.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.960]   And I hope to lay a foundation for that through this.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.960]   In Colossians 1:15-20, the context of it, the context of the entire book,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.480]   is about the supremacy of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.000]   Paul is defending Christ against false teachers and false teachings,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.680]   which would try and attempt falsely to compete with his preeminence.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.600]   And Paul is so focused on this goal, that even in his opening prayer in Colossians 1,
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.280]   he is urging us, praying for us, that we would give thanks to God
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.040]   for putting us in the kingdom of the Son of his love.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.800]   Why should we be so thankful that God put us in the kingdom of God's Son?
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.560]   That we should be so thankful to know the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.600]   Well, it all revolves around who Christ is.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.360]   And that leads us to the very discussion of Colossians 1, 15-20.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.960]   Now, how does this all work, and how is this laid out?
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.680]   This is what we call a chiasm.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.120]   A chiasm.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.880]   It's after this Greek letter here, which kind of looks like an X.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.800]   And it's meant, no matter how you slice and dice it, to be a mirror image of itself.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.200]   And that's the nature of a chiasm.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.800]   You have two parts that mirror, or many parts, that mirror each other.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.320]   Another way to think about a chiasm is a sandwich.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.360]   A sandwich has bread on top, usually, and bread on bottom, and something in the middle.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.960]   And just like you don't name a sandwich after its bread,
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.640]   you don't say, "I want a white bread, or a wheat bread, or a rye bread sandwich."
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.120]   We name it after what is in the middle.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.240]   In the same way, a chiasm often punctuates what is at its center.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.080]   And that's exactly what we have here in Colossians 1, 15-20.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:52.000]   Notice with me that we have this opening line of "Who is the image of the invisible God?"
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.800]   And down here, we have the same phrase.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.880]   "Who is the beginning?"
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.600]   Notice right here, we have the word "firstborn."
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.360]   And notice down here, we have the word "firstborn."
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.600]   Notice right after that, we have the word "for" in verse 16.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.640]   And in verse 19, it begins with the word "for."
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.720]   We have this really important set of parallelism,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.240]   where these two sections have the same key words in the same exact order, bracketing them off.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.320]   And in the middle, "and, and, and."
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.280]   You can see it.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.800]   "And he is," and then the bottom of this section, "and he is,"
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.520]   and in the center of it all, "and in him," because it's all about Christ.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.960]   And with that, we have this nice chiastic, or sandwich structure,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.040]   with two parts with the exact kind of verbiage on the outside,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.560]   and on the inside, a very punchy and powerful declaration about Christ.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.040]   "And he is," and "in him," and "he is."
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.760]   And we try to preserve this in the layout of these verses.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.280]   And this chiastic structure, this sandwich structure, declares the glory of Christ.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.360]   Because the opening section, this first part, shows that he's over all creation.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.160]   It actually declares that.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.080]   Who is the image of the invisible God?
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.440]   The firstborn, the preeminent one, the first of all creation in that regard.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.480]   And why is he this preeminent one of creation?
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.640]   Well, verse 16 explains that to us.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.120]   Because all things that were created were created in him.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.000]   By the way, that means Christ could not be created,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.600]   because he created everything that was created.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.040]   So he is outside of that category of creation.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.160]   He is creator, not created.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.560]   And furthermore, it is not just that all things have been created through him,
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.400]   but they've been created for him.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.640]   He is both the foundation of all creation, and the goal of all creation.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.240]   Therefore, he is the most preeminent of all creation.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.720]   He is head first, unquestionably so, of creation.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.200]   Well, what about the parallel section at the bottom?
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   That shows he's over new creation.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.800]   Again, look at the text.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.760]   Who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead?
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   He's the one who starts a new creation.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.240]   And furthermore, he's the firstborn from the dead.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.240]   Those who are dead and then come back to life in a new life,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.760]   in a new beginning, in a new creation.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.960]   And how can he do this?
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.200]   Well, verse 19 explains, because he is God himself.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.040]   The full embodiment of everything divine is him.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.840]   And because God is the only one who can begin a new creation,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.160]   God is the only one who can overcome death.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.880]   And so Christ alone, as God,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.200]   is the one who initiates and establishes and sets a new creation.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.600]   Well, since Jesus is over creation, and since he's over new creation,
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.680]   if you're over old, and if you're over new, you're over everything.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.720]   And that is the point.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.000]   He is preeminent.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.520]   He is exalted.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.680]   There is no one like him overall.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.200]   And that's exactly what the center of this sandwich or chiastic structure says.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.800]   Verses 17 and 18.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.240]   And he is before all things.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.080]   He's head over creation.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.200]   And he is the head of his body, the church, the redeeming work.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.400]   He's head of that too.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.000]   The work of new creation.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.600]   He's head of that as well.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   And that's why in the middle, it says,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.160]   "And in him all things hold together."
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.280]   Everything that there is, everything that exists,
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.560]   everything in the plan of God revolves around Christ.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.240]   There is no one like him.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.920]   He is exalted overall.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.600]   He is totally sovereign.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.000]   He is in a category altogether himself.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   He is first, exactly like the text says.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.680]   He is first in everything.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.000]   That is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.160]   And that's why in context, Paul is urging us, praying for us,
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.600]   that we would give thanks that God allowed us to be in the kingdom of his son.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.280]   Because instead of trying to look for the next best thing,
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.000]   trying to look around to find satisfaction somewhere else,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.720]   trying to be distracted by all these other things,
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.440]   we should instead be the most content and thankful people
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.360]   because all we have is Christ.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.840]   And Christ is everything.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.080]   And Christ is exalted.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.440]   He is the most preeminent, glorious one over all created cosmos
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.760]   and over all new creation, over everything in the plan of God.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.360]   It is all about him.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.840]   And he is, and it's all in him.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.520]   It is all that way.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.560]   And so all we have is Christ.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.200]   And he is more than we need.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.320]   It is our honor to know him.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.400]   Well, I hope through this, we have learned a little bit about this passage,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.080]   even how it's organized.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.360]   And we know, yeah, the first part, creation.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.280]   The last part, new creation.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.040]   The middle part, it's, and he is, and in him, and he is.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.400]   And we remember these things.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.080]   And that begins to help us form a foundation to memorize this whole text,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.280]   to learn it all really well and really easily.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.480]   And the goal isn't just to memorize it.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.400]   The goal is to worship Christ.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.960]   And I hope through this, that's what we end up doing,
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.920]   that we love Christ with greater clarity.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.400]   We worship him with greater precision.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.120]   We exalt him for all the preeminence that he has and that he is.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:36.000]   And so I expect that in days to come, in the providence of God,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.840]   Lord willing, that we'll have more questions and more discussions.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.760]   But in the meantime, my hope is that we study this text more and more,
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.640]   and we focus on the Lord Jesus Christ.
