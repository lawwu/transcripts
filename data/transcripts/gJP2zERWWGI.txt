[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   And he gets into it, um, later in this article, he gets into how this came about.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.820]   He was collecting this stuff because if you know, GDT, he does these, these
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.900]   beautiful, fantastical movies that often have the macabre or terrifying in them.
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.420]   So he was collecting these somewhat disturbing objects.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.200]   And at some point, his wife very reasonably said, this cannot be in our house.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.820]   Like we have young kids.
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.060]   If you want to know what I'm talking about and you're watching on YouTube, I
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.680]   have an example on the page of something that's in his bleak house.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.640]   It's, um, it's a man's face that has been ripped open and
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.900]   there's like jaws coming up.
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:44.940]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 230.
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:55.440]   I'm here in my deep work HQ joined once again by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.980]   Jesse, welcome back from vacation.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.620]   Thanks.
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.700]   It's good to be back.
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.640]   I was actually pretty impressed that I remembered how to do most of the stuff
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.520]   that happens on the computer screen.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.780]   I, it was muscle memory.
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.260]   I was actually thinking about that.
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.100]   I mean, it's not overly complicated, but there are steps that I would.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.640]   It's just a lot of little things.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.180]   But it's like riding a bike.
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.840]   So recording on garage band podcasting is like, uh, riding a bike.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.860]   Um, all right.
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.980]   News, Jesse news to share.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.360]   Uh, I think I can say officially that as of this morning, I am done with a complete
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.440]   first draft of my new book, slow productivity.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.040]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.580]   It's a little bit hazy to really put a line in the sand and say the draft is done.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.400]   Um, because for example, I have, I have a couple examples I've come across
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.160]   recently that I want to go back and integrate into prior chapters.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.320]   I also want to do a pass through and see if any of the major stories I want to
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.440]   change, uh, before I submit it.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.820]   But my definition of being done is like, as of right before I came here this
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.440]   morning, every chapter of the book has been written and polished.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.720]   So in theory, I have a complete version of the manuscript, maybe not the
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.280]   version I'm going to submit, but there's a complete version of it.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.200]   There's nothing that's either not yet written or, uh, written
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.720]   still in a, in a rough draft.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.320]   So I, I finalized the conclusion.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.600]   So as you were walking us through, you know, the quarterly plans and stuff
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.800]   since last, when you started, did it all fall into place?
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.440]   It did.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.160]   I, I laid my game plan for this manuscript.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.480]   Well, let me think about that.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.840]   Let me, let me be a little bit more careful about this.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.140]   I started writing it in earnest late spring, early summer.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.120]   Um, and so I had a plan through the summer that I think
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.400]   I was a little bit light on.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.480]   So when I got to the end of the summer, I was a little behind schedule.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.360]   Um, beginning of the fall, I laid out a plan from the beginning of the
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.480]   fall to completing the manuscript and my target was to be done basically now.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.540]   Wow.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.880]   Now it, it might sound like, wow, how did I predict that so well, but that's
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.680]   not how this works with quarterly planning.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.920]   It's not that I made a prediction and I happened to hit it.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   It's having that, that plan in place, uh, gave me back pressure to,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.120]   okay, I got to work harder now.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.080]   I got to fill an extra time.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.360]   Now it gave me milestones.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.720]   So when I, when I could see I was going behind, I could
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.160]   put an extra effort to catch up.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.900]   And when I got ahead, then I could pull back and put that effort elsewhere.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.140]   So that's the way I like to think about these sort of quarterly scale plans
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.320]   is it's not, let's just see if I hit it.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.740]   It's not a prognostication.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.880]   It's actually a set of milestones you can use to govern
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.160]   your activity throughout the way.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.600]   So it was the structure I used to govern my energy all fall long and it works.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.440]   And so I ended up coming in for a landing right around, I mean, within.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.840]   A week of, of when I was, that's so good.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.380]   Hoping to do it.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.280]   So you probably, how many hours a day did you average writing?
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.760]   Like, well, you know, six days.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.120]   So the way I normally do is I'll have a milestone.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.980]   So I'll go from just, this is multi-scale planning.
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.280]   So I'll go from my quarterly plan, uh, will influence my weekly plan.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.900]   And then my weekly plan will influence what I do each day.
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.140]   Um, and so typically when I'm writing, I have a particular
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.460]   milestone I'm trying to hit.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.220]   So it just depends how close I'm getting to it.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.060]   So if I, if I'm getting close to it or I'm falling behind, I might put
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.860]   in a five or six hour writing day.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.740]   My average writing day is going to be two hours, two and a half hours.
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.060]   So, and I would just write in the morning, most mornings, not
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.160]   Saturday, uh, was my typical schedule.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.340]   Sometimes I'd miss a morning with a meeting and I would just try to
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.920]   write for about two hours, two and a half hours.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.640]   I mean, this was really a, uh, to quote McPhee, John McPhee.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.440]   And I know this quote because it's actually at the very final
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.040]   section of the conclusion of my book.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.240]   It's from a 2010 interview McPhee did for the Paris Review.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.120]   It was interviewed by his colleague at the New Yorker, Peter Hessler.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.880]   And he has this book where he, he has this quote where he essentially.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.960]   Marvels at this idea that people think he's very hardworking or prolific
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.860]   because it says from his point of view, he's just putting a little
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.360]   drop in the bucket every day.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.480]   But he said, the thing is it's not hard.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.440]   You know, it doesn't look that impressive to add a drop
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.760]   in the bucket on a given day.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.820]   But if you do that 365 days, when you get to the end of the
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.240]   year, that bucket's pretty full.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.480]   That's the approach I took with slow productivity.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.920]   I wanted the writing to be good.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.460]   So I really just kept my focus each day on what section am I working on?
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.860]   I want this to be really good.
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.820]   And then it's not overwhelming, right?
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.700]   Because then you're focusing on I'm writing a section where I'm telling
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.560]   the story of X to make this point.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.700]   And over two days, I just want to do that really well.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.840]   And I did that really well.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.240]   Good.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.260]   What's next.
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.580]   And then you just add that up over about six or seven months.
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.420]   And you hope what you end up with is a manuscript is pretty, pretty
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.900]   well-crafted that there's not a lot of flab in it.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.360]   I mean, the thing I dislike in pragmatic nonfiction is where you clearly see
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.400]   evidence of writing for the sake of writing, I have 10,000 words.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.280]   I got to finish.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.840]   I have a week left to do it.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.060]   Type, type, type as fast as I can.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.740]   Lots of rhetorical questions, throwing in random examples.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.080]   Like just, you can tell the author is like, my God, I
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.260]   got to get these words done.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.440]   I never want that to come through in my writing.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   So it's always just today I'm writing a thousand words or whatever.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.760]   And I want those thousand words to be great.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.220]   And I think that's how you get density.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.860]   So it really worked.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.120]   I mean, we'll see how the book turns out.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.800]   But I really feel good about this drop everyday method of.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.700]   By the time I got to what I'm working on today, all I'm caring about is that
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.460]   and keeping the whole pressure of there's this whole book that needs to be finished.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.840]   And I'm not that far into it.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.620]   Keeping that at a higher scale of planning.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.960]   I only have to confront that every once in a while, maybe once a month.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.520]   And really what I want to be doing each day is just this one I'm working on this
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.280]   week, this is the part I'm doing today.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.820]   And just focus.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.080]   So anyways, I'm, I'm excited about that.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.500]   It's kind of exhausting, Jesse.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.160]   I mean, I find this with every book.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.320]   Um, it's mentally exhausting.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.720]   So I'm, I'm sort of happy to have a little bit of a break coming up because, you
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.660]   know, I'm, I'm doing New Yorker stuff at the same time.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.860]   I'm doing academic stuff at the same time.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.980]   It's a lot of thinking.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.840]   And I think about my brain the same way athletes think about their.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.860]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.540]   Muscles, right?
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.580]   I mean, you have a hard season.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.980]   You got to recharge a little bit.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.060]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.480]   I mean, we've heard a lot of examples too of people like authors who write
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.200]   five, six hours a day, every single day.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.320]   It just seems like you also write pretty fast, you know, cause this
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.100]   thing got done pretty quickly.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.660]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.380]   Uh, yeah, I got done.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.760]   I mean, this is about my pace.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.440]   If I can give it daily attention.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.840]   See, I don't need five hours a day, but I need most days to be able to give it to.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:27.340]   And, and so for me, it's, if I can connect a summer term with a teaching
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.220]   release, I can make it happen.
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.920]   Right.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.580]   So I really got going in May.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.700]   Not surprising, right?
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.340]   Because May is when my courses end.
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.860]   I had a very busy spring semester because I was teaching two courses and was, uh,
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.620]   co-chairing a university level search committee in which we were
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.200]   trying to hire three people.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.760]   Right.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.860]   So it's very time consuming, lots of, um, being on campus, uh, meeting with
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.460]   candidates, going to talks and, and a lot of overhead.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.580]   And so I didn't write basically at all.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.920]   I knew I wasn't gonna be able to write, but once I got the May, it was like,
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.740]   let's turn it on because it's summer.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.860]   Right, right, right, right, right.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.740]   And off term, right, right, right, right, right.
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.860]   And so that's why I was able to get it done in about six months.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.900]   If I was teaching this fall, I would have to, this
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.260]   is, will be a one year process.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:19.720]   So probably May to back around again to May again, because if you think about
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   it, it probably reduces the number of mornings you can write by about 40%.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.340]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.640]   And then you got to factor in loss of momentum because of that.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.060]   And yeah.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.780]   And that, that, that makes about sense.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.700]   It was, I have some, some big swings ideas for the New Yorker.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.600]   I'm excited to get to, I have some, uh, cool academic paper I'm working on.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.660]   So I'm really looking forward to the next few months going back to a, a non book
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.200]   schedule where I'm teaching and I have some articles I'm working on, but there's
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.260]   not this, I mean, I wake up every day for the six months, woken up every day.
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.700]   First thought is what am I writing today?
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.660]   You know, let's get after what am I writing?
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.260]   What am I like?
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.220]   Not, I don't waste time.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:58.780]   Don't waste time.
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.480]   We got to get into it.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.140]   You know, that's been six months of that.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.740]   So I'm looking forward to a slow start.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:10.420]   Your, um, your recent New York article was in the New Yorker weekly summary email.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.260]   I just got that.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.340]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:12.860]   Well, yeah.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.740]   So they do the New Yorker.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.140]   Oh, it was in the weekly summary.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.860]   I only get, you can get, you can sign up for a bunch of different ones.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.140]   I get the weekly one and like one of the one, I don't want the daily one.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.740]   Can you control which ones you get?
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.260]   Oh yeah.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.340]   I get too many.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.620]   You can, I mean, I write for the magazine, but I was talking to my wife
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.880]   and I were talking about that because I get like the daily humor.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.080]   Yeah, no, you can definitely.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.800]   Which I don't need.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.120]   Right.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.600]   And I get, um, this week in the magazine, which I don't need
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.640]   because I have the magazine.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.400]   I really just want the daily, but I don't get the weekly.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.360]   Well, I guess it's this week in the magazine, what I was
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   talking about, you came up.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.280]   Oh, okay.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.600]   But yeah, you can get all sorts of ones.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.720]   I think that quiet quitting one did well.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.320]   Interesting, uh, podcast shout out for that article.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.320]   The quiet quitting article came out of our podcast.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.760]   So my editor heard us talking about it and was like, you
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.600]   should write something about it.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.080]   So the podcast is providing a, a platform.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.800]   Actually, it's one of the questions I'm going to tackle later in the show.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.080]   Someone wrote in about, uh, coming up with these ideas,
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.440]   my process for researching.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.600]   So actually we're going to get into that later in the show.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.720]   Um, but before we do, I also have a request.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.120]   I realized it's been, I don't know, six months since I've asked
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.400]   this and I realized I should, uh, leave a review of the podcast.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.480]   If you get around to it, I want to go, I think it's a good way to
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.240]   get some new listeners it's confusing.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.600]   If you just come across this show, you just see it on like the.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.360]   Podcast technology charts, like what the hell is this?
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.640]   Uh, and reviews kind of help people figure it out.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.600]   So if you like the show, consider leaving a review.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.480]   Um, if you dislike the show, I just heard that the review feature
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.680]   will give you a computer virus.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.600]   You don't want to do that.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.200]   Right.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.480]   So if you like it, leave a review.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.280]   If you don't do not.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.600]   All right.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.920]   Just seeing things segments, three interesting things that people have
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.760]   emailed to my interesting account, new bar.com address, you know, I forgot
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.000]   Jesse to do the little tagline for the show and try and be better at
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.320]   identifying the show for people.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.240]   So I'll do that now.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.600]   This show is one in which I answer questions from my audience and give
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.400]   advice about the struggle to live deeply in a world beset by distractions.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.920]   So I'd like to remind everyone.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.960]   That's what we're doing here.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.280]   Our deep dive will be about that.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.480]   Our questions will be about that.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.880]   All three of our interesting things we'll cover later.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.680]   We'll all come back to that theme.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.560]   How do we live deeper in a world that's trying to destroy us with distraction?
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.040]   All right.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.560]   So let's get going with our deep dive.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.360]   The title is how well are you living?
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.200]   This is a deep dive that is supposed to be well-suited to this current
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.560]   season of new year resolutions.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.680]   Now, the inspiration for this deep dive is an email.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.280]   I read actually this morning.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.200]   It comes from a writer's group that I'm a part of, and it was an email that
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.600]   someone was sending to the writer's group.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.120]   It was a well-known writer talking about a conversation he had
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.000]   with another well-known writer.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.040]   I want to read an excerpt from this email.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.800]   I'm going to get rid of any identifying information, of course,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.680]   we'll obfuscate that, but I'm going to read the core of this
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.960]   message, what caught my attention.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:15.040]   So the well-known writer who's sending this email says, "By far the
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.400]   most interesting topic to emerge," and he's referring to a lunch he had
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.600]   recently with another author, "was the question, how well are you living?
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.560]   It's not the type of question that comes up often in overachiever circles, and
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.200]   we took a long pause to consider it.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.280]   I mean, if you were to grade yourself on how well you're living,
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.600]   what would the grade be?
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.480]   That's how we framed the question.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.280]   Well, that gave us something to really think about and led to an incredible
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.360]   set of text exchange in the days, weeks, and months to come, some of the most
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.800]   meaningful exchanges I've had in years.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.480]   So food for thought as this new year begins, how well are you living?"
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:13:01.120]   Now, I thought that was a provocative prompt because it gets at a core issue
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.040]   that I think people have when they think about improving their life, as so many
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.000]   are doing right now in the new year season.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.480]   In particular, the tension I think this highlights is the tension between
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:18.400]   holistic and focused approaches to self-improvement.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.840]   So the question, how well are you living?
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.360]   This is a holistic question.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.880]   Looking at your life as it exists in its entirety.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.160]   If someone was to write a short story about your life or film a documentary
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.840]   about your life, would it resonate with others as a life well lived?
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.160]   Would it resonate with you?
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.080]   I like hearing about this life.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.720]   And as a question about the holistic properties of your day-to-day existence.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.880]   Now it sounds obvious.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.800]   Yeah, I want to live well, but when people tackle this goal, they tend instead to
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.880]   fall into focused approaches to self-improvement where you isolate specific
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.440]   elements of your life where you want to remove something bad or do something better.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.040]   So for example, you might say, "I want to be in better shape.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.520]   So I want to exercise more.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.120]   I want to eat better.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.840]   I want to go to the gym more."
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.000]   It's just classic New Year's resolution.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.480]   You might say, "I want to be a better parent.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.080]   I feel like I'm too disorganized.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.800]   I'm not able to show up at enough of my kids' events or give them enough time.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.600]   I want to be a better parent."
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.280]   Or you might say, for example, "I want to be better at this aspect of my job.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.440]   I want my newsletter to double the amount of readers.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.080]   I want to get promoted to be team lead at my programming job," et cetera.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:40.400]   Now, the issue with this focused approach to self-improvement is that it is
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.760]   that it ignores the complex ways in which different aspects of your
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.960]   life interact with each other.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.920]   So actually the problem a lot of overachievers in particular have, so
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.160]   this is the crowd that this email I read was really talking about.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.440]   It's a bunch of overachieving writers.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.800]   The problem that overachievers have with the self-improvement is not their
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.760]   failure to make progress on things.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.000]   It's not their failure to follow through on their resolutions.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.080]   It's actually what happens when they succeed.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.600]   Because when you're doing focused self-improvement, you're messing with a
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.040]   complex mechanism by taking one aspect and maybe amplifying it that might then
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.800]   interact with or interfere with how the other aspects of your life unfold
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.160]   and things can get even worse.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:25.040]   Because often the way to solve or improve parts of your life is
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.360]   to improve your life as a whole.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:32.640]   The isolating of looking at one thing might throw everything else out of whack.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.000]   So for example, maybe you say, "I want to be in better shape," and you come up
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.720]   with these, "I'm going to train and I'm going to train for a triathlon, or
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.600]   I'm going to run a marathon."
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.480]   I see this all the time.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.720]   Like, "I'm an overachiever.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.560]   I'm going to take on like a really serious training regimen and I'm going
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.480]   to get really careful about my eating.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.400]   I have to run this much and lift these weights and do all of these things."
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.920]   And yeah, you maybe are succeeding in making that part of your life better,
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.440]   but now it's completely swapping, taking out time that you didn't really realize
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.280]   you needed before to recharge between work or home or taking away time from your
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.360]   family, or you have to wake up real early to do this.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.800]   And now suddenly other aspects of your life just got worse.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.840]   So the holistic system of your life is now actually worse off because you
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.320]   succeeded at the focus goal of, "I want to be in better shape."
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.200]   Now, sometimes the other issue that happens with focus versus holistic
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.600]   approach is that the solution requires other things to be involved.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.280]   So maybe we're looking at this hypothetical issue of, "I want to be a better parent.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.200]   I want to be in my kid's life more.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.800]   I want to go to more, whatever, events at their school.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.680]   I feel too harried."
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.200]   It might be that the solution to that has nothing to do with your commitments
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.680]   to parenting, but actually changing your work situation.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.200]   Oh, it's actually, when we see the whole picture, it's the demands of your
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.960]   specific job that's making it impossible to do this other thing that matters to you.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.160]   So we have these two issues of being focused.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.120]   One, you might succeed and in doing so actually make other things worse.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.120]   Two, you can't actually get to the real solutions because the problem, the
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.360]   problems you need to fix to improve this aspect of your life involve other
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.720]   unrelated, seemingly unrelated aspects.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.200]   This is why I like the question, "How well are you living?"
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   Because it demands that you look at the big picture.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.440]   Not, "Are you in shape?
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.080]   How's your parenting?
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.600]   How's your work?
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.560]   How's your whole life?
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.200]   Is this a life well lived or not?"
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.640]   And what it asks you to do, if you're going to resolve to improve yourself this
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.880]   new year, it asks that you resolve to improve the entire picture of your life.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.040]   Shift from this holistic picture to that holistic picture.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.080]   This one's better than this.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.640]   You think about all the aspects of your life, how they interact, how they
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.160]   push back and forth on each other.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.800]   And you make changes that make sense for the whole picture.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.480]   That's what I think.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.320]   And I'm going to recommend that those who are thinking about
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.360]   doing new year's resolutions.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.320]   This is how I think you should go about doing it.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.560]   Do not write down a disparate collection of discrete and unrelated
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.360]   resolutions of things you want to improve.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.320]   Instead, record an image of an improved lifestyle.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:04.520]   When you get to the new year 2024, what do you want your life as a whole to look like?
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.840]   When you get to new year 2030, what do you want your life as a whole to look like?
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:15.160]   And think about then how do all of these pieces need to change?
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.840]   What's holding back this?
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.320]   Is it my job is the problem here?
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.920]   Is it I've taken on too many, I have seven hobbies and this is, they're eating each
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.320]   other's time and this isn't working.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.560]   I need to simplify here.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.080]   Is it what I really need to do is shift this leisure attention to something I can
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.520]   do with my kids, because now I'm able to use the same time to connect with my
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.040]   family and find an outlet with something that's completely unrelated to my work.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.080]   You see the whole picture and you think about how you, what was
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.200]   your whole lifestyle look like?
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.120]   Do we need to move?
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.040]   Is this really the issue?
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.840]   Do we have to get out of the DC suburbs and, and move to a, you
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.480]   know, a farm in Southern Appalachia?
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.160]   I don't know, but you're not going to get to an answer unless you're seeing
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.880]   the whole picture, because if you're not seeing the whole picture, you're
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.480]   going to be picking at specific things.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.480]   I guess I'll get up at 5am to run now.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.680]   I guess I'm going to work later so I can try to get this promotion.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.880]   You need to see the whole picture.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.720]   So that's what I'm going to recommend is a holistic approach to
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.080]   new year's resolutions this year.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.560]   The question is how well are you living?
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.520]   And if you're not happy with the answer, you need to focus on how you upgrade
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.320]   your life as a whole, not little individual aspects of it.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.880]   So anyways, that was a good question, Jesse.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.880]   How well are you living?
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.800]   It's the right way to think about it.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.400]   More and more.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.520]   I'm realizing that in my life as I get new years after new years is.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:35.000]   The whole game is crafting lifestyle and how things interact with each other.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.640]   I mean, everything is so related.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.680]   Uh, the thing that comes up most often, I think is how much your job, the details
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.040]   of your job interacts with like everything else, you know?
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.880]   And so it's the issue and overachievers, like I'm just going to like crush
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.960]   it even more at my job, I'm this successful.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.120]   How would I be more successful?
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.760]   As they don't realize how much that is often crushing everything else.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.040]   Or they'll try an isolation to say, I'm going to be, you know, the
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.200]   coach of the little league team and train for the triathlon and realize
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.080]   because of the reality of their job, there's no way to actually do that.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.560]   And then it becomes a huge source of stress or anxiety, or the commute is the
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.120]   issue.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.120]   And, you know, if we moved here, but we'd have to change the job.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.960]   I mean, it's all about seeing this whole picture as a puzzle.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.000]   How do I figure out if I move this piece, I can adjust that piece.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.400]   This then allows this piece to move over here.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.280]   Oh, the whole thing clicks together into a new hole.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.000]   That's much better.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.040]   It's a, it's a dynamic system.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.400]   And then as you always talk about, I guess, distorted when people, you know,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.960]   look at social media and stuff like that.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.640]   And that just makes it worse because again, social media, especially Instagram,
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:40.000]   it's going to isolate these individual features of people's lives and
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.520]   exaggerated and make it seem.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.760]   That's what people want.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.600]   And you're like, oh, that's what I need.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.720]   Like, why, why don't I look like, uh, this came up last night.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.520]   We were watching, the family was watching a movie on Netflix.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.880]   It's a kid's movie called finding a Wana.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.560]   I mean, obviously that word, right.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.200]   But it takes place in Hawaii and it's like a family from Brooklyn comes back
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.840]   to Hawaii because their grandfather had a heart attack and as happens.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.880]   They find a lost pirate treasure map and, or, you know, sort of Goonie
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.000]   styles, like the kids are trying to whatever, but anyways, they're, it's
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.360]   kind of built around their dad had died and he comes back to spoiler alert,
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.720]   but he sort of comes back as a ghost.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:27.440]   Um, and, uh, it turns out this guy is an Instagram fitness model because my, my
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.320]   son was like, where have I seen him before?
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.080]   And so you look at these pictures, gentlemen is in very good shape.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:39.960]   He is, he's like, he's like the, it's like, um, you know, if you're a producer
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.720]   and you're like, get me the rock and like the rock is not available, you're like,
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.920]   then get me his like much cheaper non-union equivalent.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.400]   Like you get this guy, right.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:54.680]   He's like a really buff, uh, guy who the promise he's 10 inches shorter than the
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.760]   rock, but, uh, where I'm going with this is you see his Instagram photos.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.040]   He's a Hawaiian cowboy.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.200]   So he's shirtless with like 36 inch biceps with a cowboy
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.680]   hat on horses or whatever.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.960]   You see that in isolation and you're like, ah, man, you know, I guess I should be
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.040]   spending two hours a day in the gym.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.480]   Like just like ripping at it to become like a buff Hawaiian cowboy.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.840]   But you know, how does that fit with all the other aspects of your life?
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.560]   Like if you're going to play, um, Ghosts and movies or whatever of like Hawaiian
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.960]   warriors, like, yeah, that's what you should do.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.480]   Uh, that's all you're doing.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.320]   Like your job is to get in really good shape.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.560]   Um, where I'm trying to go with this, Jesse is I'm going to move to Hawaii
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.720]   and just work out all the time, all the time.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.080]   I'm not sure why I thought about the example.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:41.960]   Um, all right.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.160]   Anyways, uh, we got a whole good chunk of questions to get to.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.040]   I want to briefly mention before we get there, one of the sponsors
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.840]   that makes this show possible.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.240]   And that is our friends at Hinson shaving.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.680]   I shaved with my Hinson razor just a couple hours before it is one
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.160]   of my favorite things I own.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:07.440]   Like if I did like an Oprah's favorite things, uh, bit, you know, Oh, he's
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.880]   the five favorite things of this year.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.280]   This razor would be on the, uh, would be on the list.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.480]   So let me tell you what it does.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.960]   Um, and why I like it.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:19.600]   So a Hinson's razor is this precision built aluminum, precisely
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.120]   CNC routed metal razor.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.400]   Um, you put into it standard safety blades, 10 cent blades.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.880]   And because this thing is made so precisely, you can get a great shave.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:39.080]   By just using a 10 cent blade within this beautifully milled razor.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:39.600]   So here's the idea.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.960]   You pay more upfront to get this beautiful razor, but then going forward,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.640]   you're just buying 10 cent blades and replacing them every week.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.120]   So your cost, uh, your average cost of shave begins to plummet.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.200]   And after a while, it's much cheaper than using a subscription service or
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.840]   buying the, uh, the drugstore brands.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.880]   How do they make this thing so precise?
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.280]   Well, the company that makes Hinson's razors.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.160]   Is a family owned aerospace parts manufacturer.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.320]   So they have all of the equipment needed to do incredibly
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.080]   precise milling of parts.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.800]   They've worked on the international space station.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.320]   They've worked on parts for the Mars Rover.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.040]   So they had all this equipment to make the razors precisely milled.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.600]   This turns out to be the key to having a successful shave.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.800]   You want just a very little bit of the blade protruding on either
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.200]   side of the safety razor body.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.880]   Just enough to shave, but not so much that you get flex.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.600]   You have too much of that blade coming out.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.440]   You get flex is called the diving board effect.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.760]   That's where you get nicks.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   So you want just a little bit coming out and they're able to build these
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.600]   things so precisely with their aerospace grade CNC machines that they have.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.760]   A 0.0013 inches of blade.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.240]   That's it extending out.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.040]   So anyways, it's a beautifully manufactured piece of equipment.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.120]   It gives you a great shave and it gives you the satisfaction of knowing that,
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.200]   uh, you're gonna be saving money in the longterm.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.640]   You're gonna be feeling good about that.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.880]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a

[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.720]   applications where you do writing.

[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:15.480]   There's some features in Grammarly that is going to blow your mind.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:22.040]   So, uh, for example, the Grammarly premium product has whole sentence rewrites.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.600]   It will take hard to read sentences and say, rewrite them this way.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.920]   It's going to be much clearer for people to read.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:36.880]   Grammarly also, uh, has a way of helping your style with vocabulary suggestions.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.200]   Here's a clear word.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.000]   Here's a better word.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.120]   Maybe here is a more vivid word.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.960]   It also has, and I find this amazing, a tone detector.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.280]   So we'll come in and give you a second opinion on how your tone is coming across.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.360]   Huge issue with written communications.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.600]   You think you're being super clear in your email, you're typing, not realizing
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.720]   that it comes across as you being angry or you being upset, where really what
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.000]   you're trying to do is you're just in a hurry, you're Grammarly writing
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.480]   assistance, like this is the tone I'm detecting here.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.520]   You might say, okay, good.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.360]   Thank you.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:06.800]   Grammarly.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.000]   Let me rewrite this in a way that's not going to accidentally upset my colleagues.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   There's a really cool product.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.560]   Uh, it's going to keep your writing clear, concise, and correct.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.400]   Now, why am I proud to have this as a sponsor?
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.440]   Because writing is how you express yourself in the 21st century knowledge
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.600]   economy, it's emails, it's Slack, it's documents, it's pitch decks, it's text
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.080]   messages, writing is our primary mode of communication, especially as
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.360]   more and more work is remote.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.880]   If you can write clearly and concisely with the right tone, with not only
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.600]   grammatical correctness, but you, uh, this type of forceful confidence of what
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.480]   you're saying, it is a huge competitive advantage.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.960]   Grammarly, you put Grammarly on your devices.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.640]   It will give you that edge.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.080]   It's one of the simplest things you can do, in my opinion, to begin to
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.520]   stand out more in almost any knowledge work job.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.040]   So start the year off right with Grammarly.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.160]   Now here's the good news.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.360]   My listeners can get 20% off Grammarly premium if they go to
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:14.600]   grammarly.com/deep that's 20% off at G R A M M A R L Y.com/deep
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.160]   grammarly.com/deep.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.120]   All right, Jesse, let's, uh, let's do some questions.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.120]   All right.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.720]   Sounds great.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.120]   First question's from Chris.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.320]   How do you keep track of all the other habits you develop
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.920]   besides your Keystone habit?
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.280]   All right.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.880]   This is a good new year's question.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:39.120]   Uh, so as long time listeners know, I have this procedure I pitch on this
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.960]   podcast for how to transform your life towards the goal of depth.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.480]   So how to go towards what we call the deep life.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.080]   And the procedure I talk about is to divide your life into different buckets
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.280]   that cover different aspects of your life.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.400]   So you have craft for your work, community for your friends, family.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.720]   Uh, you have constitution for your health and so on.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.400]   And I have this procedure.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.040]   I always come back to where I say, if you're going to overhaul your life
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:09.240]   towards depth, start by putting in place a Keystone habit in each of these, what
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:15.040]   we call buckets, something distractible, but non-trivial, and that's just about
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.120]   setting your mindset right.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.640]   You know, when it comes to my health, when it comes to my work, when it comes
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.200]   to my relationships, when it comes to my sort of ethical or spiritual development,
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.040]   there's something I do every day.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.000]   That's a, it's not trivial and I do it.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.360]   And that signals to myself, I care about these L areas and I'm, and I'm willing
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.480]   to do work that's optional, but important.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.160]   Once you've laid that psychological foundation, then I talk about going
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.360]   bucket by bucket and spending a month or two to really overhaul each.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.080]   So what Chris is asking is where did the results of that bucket by
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.120]   bucket overhauls get written down?
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.080]   How do you remember, let's say when you overhaul constitution, what you've
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.520]   decided about your health and fitness.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.120]   When you overhaul craft and you've made changes in how you approach your work,
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.960]   you have new visions, where does that go?
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.520]   That's a very good question.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.280]   So, uh, Chris and I brought my computer here, Chris, because I'm going to
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.920]   actually look at my own documents and answering this question, but
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.800]   the basic answer is two part.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:17.120]   So the first place, if I'm overhauling a bucket, the first place, those
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:22.320]   proposed changes are going to go is in my strategic plan, what we also call
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.880]   a quarterly plan or semester plan.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.720]   That's where it lives at first.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.360]   So that every week I see these changes and I'll give it a name off in, you know,
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.400]   I'll be like, okay, this is the project.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:31.800]   Whatever.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.240]   I like to do that, you know, project work 2.0 or something.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   And I'll often even put, I'm looking at it on my screen right now, like a, a
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   table inside the Google doc I use.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.080]   There's a border and put the name at bold and I'll have that right at the top of it.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.800]   And it's a reminder of like, this is the, this is what we're trying right now.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.200]   Uh, we're doing this every day.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.120]   We're using this new system and we have, you know, we're trying to hit this
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.840]   milestone every month for the next three months, so it's right there, right in your
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:02.880]   face, I will leave it there, uh, for a while because not everything is going to
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.280]   stick and I'll, I'll change it maybe over time, like, let me get rid of this.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.040]   Let me update this.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.520]   So it's sort of a living document.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.480]   After a while, if this overhaul has created changes that are going to stick,
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.160]   this is just going forward.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.320]   What I always do with fitness.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.200]   This is going forward.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.320]   Something I always do with craft.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:27.200]   I have another document where those changes will then get encoded and on my
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.120]   system here, and I'm looking in my core folder and my personal Google docs.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:36.920]   And I have my, my, uh, my work strategic semester planning here.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.600]   I have my, um, personal family life career strategic planning here.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.280]   I have my values document here.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:49.640]   And the fourth document is called core systems that run my life.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:56.280]   This is where new habits or systems or rules to become a permanent part of my
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:00.040]   life, eventually migrate and find their permanent home.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.080]   So I'm loading that up now.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.640]   I'm not going to, uh, I've talked about this before.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.560]   I won't read the details, but let me give you the category.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.440]   So, so right up top at the top of this document, I've written below
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.080]   our summaries of the three main categories that contain the
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.440]   elements of my core systems.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.080]   Those categories are core documents, productivity, and discipline.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.880]   So under core documents, this is where I discuss how my value document works,
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.120]   how my strategic plans works and maintenance.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.680]   Like when do I check on these?
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.240]   How do I update these under productivity?
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:40.760]   This is where I capture, um, daily, weekly planning, uh, how that works,
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.280]   multi-scale planning, shutdowns, capture, like the different elements that are at
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.040]   the core of, of, of sort of how I organize that.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.200]   And then under discipline is where I have, okay, these are just things I do on a
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.560]   regular basis and all these different buckets, you know, aspects of my life.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:01.640]   So this is where, um, this is where permanent changes to different
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.880]   buckets of my life end up.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.520]   They'll largely be in this, uh, core systems document exceptions abound.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.080]   Okay.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.000]   So some things become so core, I don't even bother writing them down.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.640]   I just sort of get used to this is what I do.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:21.800]   Um, other things like live pretty permanently in my strategic plans.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.960]   Right.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:29.400]   So, so for example, uh, there might be some vision I have and let me be specific.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.280]   There is a vision I have for where I'm trying to get with my work.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.440]   Like what I, the, the, the lifestyle vision of my working life.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.840]   I want that's in my, at the top of my strategic plan for work that lives there.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.120]   So like every time I'm up, you know, uh, overhauling that strategic plan or just
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.960]   looking at it to make my weekly plan, I just see again and again, this vision I
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.640]   have on my life.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.760]   And so I don't forget that where I want to get.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.400]   And on this list, it's five attributes that I have.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.440]   Um, so some things just live in my strategic plans, these sort of like lifestyle
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.760]   visions and stuff, live in there.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.480]   Some things I just do, I get used to it.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.640]   I don't bother writing it down and other things make their way into my core systems.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.800]   All right.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.000]   So Chris, that's a good question.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.200]   Um, that's how I, that's how I run it.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:15.480]   I will say psychologically speaking, the point of that core systems document.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.160]   So like, I don't worry about forgetting it.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:21.320]   Practically speaking, I never read it because if you do, if you do these things
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.400]   again and again, after a year or two, you don't really need to be reminded, but it
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.560]   makes me feel good to know at least it's written down somewhere.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.240]   All right.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.400]   What do we got as our next question here?
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.000]   All right.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.120]   Next question, Terry.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.960]   A software developer from England.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.840]   I'm currently 36.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.960]   I spent a while neglecting all my deep life buckets.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.760]   I had a minimum wage job, irregular exercise, no social life.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.640]   Then I discovered deep work and so good.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.560]   They can't ignore you around 2017.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.440]   Thanks to those and Jocko Willink's podcast.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.000]   I learned to code, landed a programming job.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.120]   I enjoy a triple my previous salary and now exercise four or five times a week.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.880]   So thank you for the assistance there.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.720]   Your podcast also poached me away from Jocko's.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.800]   The one bucket I still struggle with is community and simply just
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.560]   being social at the basic level.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.920]   I really know what to say in a one-on-one conversation, even with
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.480]   people I've known for years, and I often fail to take advantage of social
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.880]   networking events because of it.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.440]   All right.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:25.880]   So first of all, Terry, um, you gotta be quieter about talking about me
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.360]   poaching you away from Jocko's podcast.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:34.200]   I do not want Jocko Willink to snap me into three different pieces.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.600]   He is one of the scariest human beings alive.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:43.680]   And, uh, I don't want him to know or think of me as a competitor because
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:48.720]   he could, um, he could destroy me in a very literal, very literal sense.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.600]   If you don't know who Jocko Willink by his way, just look at seven seconds.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.240]   Of a Jocko YouTube video.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.360]   And you know exactly what I talked about.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.120]   In fact, Jesse, I think we should, we should try doing some
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.080]   Jocko style YouTube videos.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.160]   It would get you on the rower.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.560]   Have you seen, do you watch any Jocko videos?
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.920]   Yeah, I've seen them over the years.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.600]   Black and white.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:15.680]   And then he, he puts a mic, he, he eats the mic and they put up the base and
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:21.160]   he's just like, you know, I was, uh, you know, whatever, whatever he's saying.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:21.400]   Right.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.360]   Get after it.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.040]   Get after it.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.200]   It's like terrifying, you know?
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.320]   Um, so he's a terrifying man.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.000]   And I think it'd be funny if we did our videos that way.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.920]   Um, so first things first, Terry, uh, don't tell Jocko that you stopped
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.400]   listening to his podcast because of me.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.640]   Uh, second thing, second, congratulations on the turnaround.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.240]   We'll get to the one remaining issue you have about community bucket in a second.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.280]   But I, this one, this one, I'm gonna make a quick aside because I hear from a lot
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.880]   of different people from a lot of different, uh, A lot of different
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.840]   situations in life, and, and I think there's, there's sort of an important
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.320]   internet culture point being made here.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:06.880]   There is a lot of men for whom aspirational think of it as like manhood
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:13.160]   podcast, like Jocko's is a very important and positive force in their life.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:18.800]   I mean, look at Terry went from minimum wage job, a regular exercise, no social
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.840]   life, um, to a really good programming job.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.520]   And he's in very good shape and is actively working on trying to, in, in
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.760]   improve his social life.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.080]   Like this is a real turnaround.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.920]   Um, and I think the reason is as, as someone who gives advice, who's
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.200]   given advice my whole life, what I've learned is that different people have
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.920]   different, uh, there's different things that resonate with them.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.560]   And you want to reach someone, you have to figure out what it is exactly that
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.120]   resonates with that particular person.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.600]   And it's different for different people for a lot of men, but not all, but for a
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.160]   lot of men, there's something about a sort of traditional, you know, Jocko has
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.160]   giant arms and wakes up at four 30 and growls in his microphone and is like, you
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:00.320]   can do more than you think, you know, get after it, have discipline, um, Discipline.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.680]   Was it disciplined as freedom?
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.760]   Is that right?
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.360]   For a lot of guys that really resonates, right.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.960]   Just because of the way they're wired and biochemically and hormonally or whatever
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.720]   that resonates, and it can really lead to a lot of changes.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:18.400]   Now for other people, it doesn't, but I think this is this pluralistic advice is,
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.600]   uh, pluralistic modes of advice is something that we, we need to embrace.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.080]   And so I think there is a pushback against the, the Jockos of the world where other
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.520]   people that makes them uncomfortable.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:35.840]   So having like a 250 pound, uh, silver star winning sort of war hero, Navy
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.200]   seal type growling at them makes them really uncomfortable, which completely
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.280]   makes sense because again, different people get advice different ways.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:43.600]   Right.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.560]   So like, I don't get that uncomfortable around Bernie or around Jocko, but, um,
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.520]   I was talking about this story recently.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:53.600]   I remember years ago, I was on the same circuit as Brené Brown.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:59.960]   And I remember back in like 2011, her and I spoke at the same event and she did her
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.400]   presentation and the crowd was on their feet and they were dancing.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.760]   And I remember turning to the person next to me and being like, I don't
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.120]   understand the word she just said.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.640]   Because she was speaking a language that really resonates with some
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.040]   people, but for me made no sense.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.120]   So I think recognizing, uh, different.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.480]   Tones of advice work for different people and we need a
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.960]   pluralistic approach to advice.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:27.640]   I think this is really important sort of device, uh, advice diversity.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.800]   So just like I shouldn't say.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.440]   Brené Brown should go away because I don't understand why she has people
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.800]   dance, like what's going on here.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.120]   Uh, you know, I feel the same thing when people are saying, I don't like Jocko.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.040]   Like, I don't know, this makes me uncomfortable.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.760]   He turned Terry's life around and there's a lot of other people like that.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.040]   So I think there's two things.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.400]   And again, I'm just going on a tangent here because I've been thinking
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.960]   about internet culture recently, and I'm going to get back to your question, Terry.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.000]   But I think there's two different things going on.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.160]   Uh, when we see something like a discomfort with Jocko, um, uh, the first
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.320]   is what I just talked about here.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.040]   It's just like that particular tone doesn't resonate with me.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.480]   So, uh, I think, you know, this person go away.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.440]   Second, and I'm going to add a bonus here.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:18.280]   So second, I think is the, the mixing of the universal with the existential.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.560]   So I'm about to teach propositional logic to my, my undergraduate
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.920]   mathematics class starting next week.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.200]   And that's the first topic we cover.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.080]   So this is on my mind.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.880]   I think this happens a lot where we go from a proper dislike of the universal
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:36.040]   leading to an improper rejection of the existential, what do I mean by that?
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.520]   Well, we might look at, uh, the trope of manhood promoted by someone like
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:46.320]   Jocko and correctly say, this should not be the only vision of manhood that we push.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.120]   If this is the only thing that's available, if it's the only thing we
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.760]   promote or support, that's a problem because not all men, this is going to
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:57.040]   resonate with that's a completely appropriate rejection of the universal.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.800]   It is easy for that to slip.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.240]   However, into the fear of the existential, where you go from, this
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:07.200]   shouldn't be the only vision of manhood we push to, we should never
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.680]   push this version of manhood.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.440]   The existence of anyone still pushing that is a problem.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.360]   So it's very easy.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:17.080]   I think in, when you're thinking about, uh, in a broad sense, like.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.080]   Progressive.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.720]   And I don't mean this in a political sense, but in the actual definition
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.840]   of the term evolution of culture, it's very easy to go from the rejection
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.520]   of the universal to the demonization of the existential, there shouldn't
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.440]   only be Jocko as our model for manhood, but we shouldn't.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.080]   Say, uh, there should be no Jocko's because for some people that really
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.840]   resonates, the third thing I think that's happening here is also, um,
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.720]   there's some real, I don't know.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.080]   I don't want to, I don't, this is a non-explicit podcast.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:50.120]   I don't want to curse, but there's some like terrible toxic guys out there as well.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.960]   And it's easy to start mixing it up.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.840]   So it's easy to say, and I don't know much about this guy, but there's this guy.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.560]   Have you heard this Andrew Tate guy, Jesse?
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.480]   No, I mean, I don't know.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.680]   I, I only know about him because I don't, I'm not on social media because
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.520]   this is now crossed over into, it was on the front page of the Washington post.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:12.760]   But I guess he's like one of these, um, it's like a toxic, like, uh, he got
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:17.200]   arrested for sex trafficking in Romania, but like, um, his whole thing is alpha
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:21.840]   male, like, but in like a caricature sort of, I'm going to be outrageous, sort of,
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.840]   uh, to get eyeballs type of thing and smoke cigars and stand in front of my jet.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.600]   And, and, you know, that like that type of thing, like really sort of over the
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.480]   top and annoying, um, and he just got arrested or whatever that exists.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.480]   And so maybe what's happening is also people are somehow mixing, mixing
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.360]   that up because like, well, Jocko has muscles and like talks in a deep voice,
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.960]   but man, those are so different things.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:49.040]   Jocko has like two silver stars, you know, for like heroic valor on the
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.000]   battlefield, like saving people's lives.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.520]   I, he, he, he ran the brutal task force bruiser during the battle for
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:01.320]   Ramadi, um, has had to watch, you know, and he's cried about this on air, having
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:05.440]   to watch the death of people who were close to him that were just doing the
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.320]   mission, the suicides that came after.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.440]   Um, and getting through this, he's like a leader to this community.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.680]   So we have on one hand, an American hero, and on the other hand, a sex
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.160]   trafficker who, you know, smoke cigars and really, well, they're both
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.040]   kind of muscly or whatever.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.040]   It's completely different.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.680]   But again, if you're not really familiar with the world, maybe you mix it up.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.640]   Um, so those are my, those are my three reasons why, you know,
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.960]   these are my three, please, uh, different type of advice resonates
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.160]   with different type of people.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:34.760]   And be worried about proper rejection of the universal leading to fear of the
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:40.680]   existential and also don't mix up, uh, people that seem superficially similar.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:44.280]   The real reason why I'm giving these three, these three explanations, Jesse,
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.520]   this is all about trying to prevent Jocko from killing me.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.920]   I spent five minutes defending Jocko because I'm terrified of them.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.440]   Actually, I hear he's a nice guy.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.360]   I have friends in common.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.440]   I hear he's a really nice guy.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.560]   You guys would get along.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.200]   I think so.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.920]   I think there's guys who are like, know what they're about.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.720]   Navy SEAL, black belt in jujitsu or whatever, or like the nice guys,
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.680]   because they have nothing to prove.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.960]   They're like, I just, they just go through life kind of, you know.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.200]   Um, you know, nice.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.280]   He lives in San Diego because it's sunny, he surfs.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.440]   He probably reads your books.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.600]   He might, I should, I should meet him.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.280]   And his podcast is mainly, uh, uh, military.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.760]   So he has a lot of other military people.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:31.160]   All right, Terry, as for your question about community, um, my, my concern here
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.760]   is you're, you're thinking about it too systematically, like how do I talk to
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.960]   people, how do I like optimize interaction?
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:40.440]   And I'm going to suggest change the name of this bucket in your mind.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:46.320]   From community to service and say, what I want to do with this bucket is forget,
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.440]   like, am I having enough conversations with people?
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.880]   Am I, am I a good socializer is how do I serve other people?
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.800]   And let's just get that bucket going, start with a keystone habit
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.040]   and then build up to an overhaul.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:02.480]   Ways that you can give non-trivial amounts of your time, attention, and
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.880]   energy towards improving other people's lives.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.080]   And this could be straight up community service.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.160]   Like I'm, I'm, you know, volunteering for my church and we're
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.360]   helping run this initiative.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.800]   Or it could be, I'm a part of this group of other people who share an interest
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.640]   and we try to help each other out and encourage people.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.960]   And I see what I'm trying to do here is like, they're giving me help,
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.120]   but I want to help other people.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.800]   Um, you know, I want to just, how can you serve other people?
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.120]   And this is an idea that I argue in digital minimalism,
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.720]   my book, digital minimalism.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:37.520]   This is really where the, the factor that causes our mind to think about a social
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.200]   connection with someone else being strong is not how well do we talk.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:45.520]   It's, am I sacrificing non-trivial time and attention on behalf of this person?
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.440]   If you do that, your mind says, this is a member of my tribe.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.920]   We're in the group together.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.720]   They're an important person in my life.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.120]   It's what makes you feel social.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.920]   It's what makes you feel connected, not how much you talk to people, but
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.280]   how much you give for other people.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.720]   So don't worry about the talking right now and think more
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.040]   about how to serve other people.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.960]   You will feel more connected.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.080]   The conversation will come after that.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.680]   The friend, the other stuff will follow, but I would say, turn away from
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.000]   you and turn towards other people.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.520]   That's probably the best way for you to tackle this community bucket.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.040]   All right.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:24.040]   Just looking at the door to see, I don't want to hear like the footsteps of Jocko.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.760]   Um, all right.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.120]   What do we got?
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.800]   Let's do another question.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.240]   All right.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.880]   Next question, Scott, a scientist from Boston.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.800]   I write on the platform medium.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.560]   My problem is whenever I get an idea for an article, I get stuck into a trap of
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.000]   being unable to stop going too deep and have trouble distilling the essential
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.560]   idea down to a 10 to 12 minute read.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.320]   How do you distill complex idea into short form for the New Yorker articles
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.840]   without getting into the trap of trying to capture everything there
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.840]   is to say about a complex topic?
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:58.040]   Uh, well, Scott, I mean, the first thing to recognize is that distilling
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.640]   complex ideas to something that's essential, that hangs together, that
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:06.120]   captures people's attention and, uh, improves or augments the way they
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.720]   understand the world that is really hard to do.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.920]   And so I want to lay that as a foundation.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.720]   So you're not overly hard on yourself or disappointed that you're not just
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.400]   naturally able to accomplish that pretty easily.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:24.640]   I think that type of idea writing is in a way like screenwriting in the sense
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.360]   that the finished product is so familiar and natural that we make the mistake of
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.840]   assuming, well, I should be able to do that easily as well.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.160]   So when you, you see a lot of movies in your life, screenwriters
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:35.960]   talk about this all the time.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.960]   People in their lives see a lot of movies.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.680]   And when you see a movie, it's like, it comes, it's just natural.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.840]   Like there, there people are talking and things are blowing up and you think
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.720]   like, well, yeah, I mean, I could do that.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.800]   Like I have ideas and I have a plot ideas.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.240]   And what if like the robot was actually, you know, um, secretly this guy's
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.520]   brother and, and his sister was dead the whole time, like we come with
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.840]   plots and kind of imagine it.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.960]   And we say, yeah, we could do that too.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:01.160]   But what you don't recognize is to actually make a screenplay work.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.480]   The make a screenplay just seem natural.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.240]   Like, yeah, there's this plot and it happened.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:09.680]   It's incredibly hard because there's a million things that makes a screenplay
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.320]   break all of the MacGuffins, all the red herrings, like you gotta be very
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.520]   careful to get rid of all those things.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.000]   All the pieces have to fit together.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.280]   Everything that sets up has to be resolved.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.560]   Motivations have to be here.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.720]   There can't be any wasted beats to make a screenplay feel so natural.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.000]   It's incredibly hard to do.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.320]   Similar with, I think idea writing in the end, if you do it well, it's like, oh yeah.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.560]   That's a good way of thinking about that.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:32.680]   Cool.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.240]   Good idea.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.600]   And you're like, I have good ideas all the time.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.360]   Why can't I do that?
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.200]   But it's actually really hard to deliver that because the idea has to, everything
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.480]   has to work, no red herrings, no MacGuffins, the things you set up are resolved.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.640]   At the end, the idea makes complete sense of exactly what you introduced.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.760]   There's no loose threads.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.320]   The whole thing moves.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.280]   There's some slight of hand.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.160]   You kind of navigate around the complexities as if they don't exist.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.160]   That's really hard to do.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.040]   But when you read it, you're like, oh yeah, this is natural.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.760]   So I want to start with that.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.240]   So you don't feel too bad about yourself.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.200]   I do a lot of idea writing, but you have to remember.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.120]   I I'm kind of an exceptional character in this.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:12.360]   And in some sense, I was like bred in a lab like Drago and Rocky four.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.760]   To be a, an idea writer.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.600]   I was exposed to all this writing in my teenage years because
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.200]   I was a teenage entrepreneur.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.720]   Um, so I read a lot.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.360]   I read a lot of pragmatic nonfiction.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.000]   I read a lot of idea nonfiction.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.680]   I was sort of like obsessed with this as a kid.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.880]   I was also a precocious writer.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.600]   I was pulled into this gifted and talented writing program when I was eight years
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.680]   old, where instead of having to do normal English class, we'd read really hard books
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:40.400]   and write, write, write, write, write constantly writing these really long, uh,
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.440]   short stories and essays.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:46.760]   And, and so like I was a precocious writer who happened through happenstance
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.080]   to be exposed to this style of writing really early in college.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:54.040]   I became a serious writer, a editor of the humor magazine, a columnist for the
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.920]   newspaper and began writing idea books, signed my first book deal right
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.320]   after I turned 21 years old.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.320]   So I've been doing this my entire life.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.480]   This is why I say I've been bred in the lab to do idea writing.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:09.280]   So now by the time I'm 40, uh, it's a little bit more natural for me.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:14.720]   You know, I can pretty quickly assess like, here's an idea I can deliver pretty
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.760]   quickly, but that's all really hard.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.840]   All right.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.560]   So all of that's just to say, um, don't be down on yourself.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.040]   Now I have some advice to give to you.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:29.120]   So if you're doing a idea writing a, remember your goal is not to cover all of
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:34.760]   the details, all the possible caveats, all the alternative paths forward, you're
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.320]   trying to tell a coherent, cohesive story with narrative momentum that in the end
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.440]   will give the reader another tool to use in trying to build an understanding of
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.000]   the world, you're not writing a textbook.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.200]   You're delivering one new take that people can add to their collective
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.160]   understanding of the world.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.760]   The thing I think that often slows down new writers in this space and leads to
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.280]   the, um, excessive research issue that you talk about you having, where you
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.720]   spend so much time researching, you never get to the article, it's often
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.040]   fear of imagined critique.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.960]   You get paralyzed by this idea that, you know, someone's going to come
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.440]   along and say, wait a second, Scott.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.400]   You didn't talk about this.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.160]   Like you, you told us that this is the way the world works, but you didn't
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.560]   talk about, you know, this effect or that study.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.000]   I don't think you really understand what's going on here.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.920]   That imagined critique, it can be really paralyzing, especially,
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.080]   especially for new writers.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:33.320]   And I have a theory that the, the current moment because of the rise of social
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:37.680]   media and in particular, the hair trigger critique culture on, on Twitter.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.880]   Where a lot of writers engage makes this problem even worse.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:47.120]   You know, when I was writing as a 21 year old, maybe a letter would make its way to
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.800]   me, or there'd be a review in a newspaper that was mean, but that was about it.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.080]   Like today, everything is going to get picked over.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.760]   And so you're so worried about, uh, triggering critique
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.920]   because it's so accessible.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   I think it paralyzes writers more.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.640]   It's not your goal to write a textbook on the topic.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.440]   Tell a story that hangs together.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.000]   That's going to help me understand the world.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.760]   If I'm the reader, I'm smart.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:13.960]   I recognize that, you know, Cal's story about quiet quitting and generational
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.640]   relationships with work is not the full story.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.120]   And there's three other things going on here and it doesn't apply to this group.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.400]   And he didn't talk about generation X.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:24.680]   I know all of that as the reader, but I'm just going to pull out here.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.760]   Here's a new tool to add to my toolbox.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.760]   So that's, that's your goal.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.840]   So that, that should help, uh, be.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.240]   Work backwards from the insight and then find support.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.520]   So if your approach and in your elaboration, Scott, you talked about this more.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.880]   If your approach is I'm going to learn everything I can about this topic, and
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:46.160]   then hopefully, uh, I'll be able to emerge a cohesive story about how
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   this part of the world works.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.080]   There's no end to how much you can learn.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:54.680]   And, and so typically in advice writing, you sort of have the insight first, and
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.960]   then you're working backwards from that.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.280]   Like, how do I make this argument?
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.200]   How do I fill it in?
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.800]   And we're going to get into those details in the next question.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.520]   So stay tuned.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:08.760]   Um, and then three or C a B C, um, the pieces you present all have to fit.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.640]   So the story has to, it's like a screenplay.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.600]   The story has to be cohesive.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.320]   If you introduce something early, that has to, there has to be a reason for it.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:21.440]   That has to be, uh, made sense of later or be responded to later.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.040]   If you bring in an example, that example has to be just what
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.360]   you need to fill in a point.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.960]   No red herrings, no McGuffins, right?
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.040]   So you can't have things that you put in there that end up not being so important
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.760]   or you end up just leaving hanging.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.400]   Uh, so you have to think of yourself as I'm going to open up these ports and I
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.040]   have to close them again before the article ends.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:45.560]   So that type of consistency is actually more important to comprehensiveness.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:49.360]   A consistent, cohesive story is more important than I've
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.680]   covered every possible angle.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.080]   All right, Scott, those are my, that's my advice.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:59.280]   I think we got, I purposely scheduled this, this next question, Jesse, because
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.840]   it, uh, follows up directly on what Scott was asking about.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.480]   Okay.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.840]   Next question's from Enzo.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:10.240]   In a previous episode, you discussed quiet quitting and described how you
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.000]   researched the origins of the phrase in a TikTok video.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.360]   Can you, uh, can Cal talk through his article research methods in more detail?
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.920]   Right.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.480]   So this is a elaboration of what I was talking to about Scott.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.640]   Let me get into how I typically work on idea articles.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.000]   I sort of broke down my process here.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.520]   So I'll go through it.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.520]   I have a bunch of steps on here.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.680]   Um, so I start with having a foundation of just broadly consuming
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.480]   potentially relevant information.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.560]   That's key.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.760]   You got to have grist to the mill of creative insight.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:46.040]   So this includes the five books I read, you know, my five book a month.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.400]   Reading pace.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.520]   I read a lot of articles.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.000]   I listened to a lot of podcasts.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.280]   I do research to answer questions on this podcast.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.360]   That sometimes is a source of ideas.
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.120]   And I read a bunch of the stuff you guys send me.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.560]   Interesting account, newport.com.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.560]   You guys send me really interesting.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:06.120]   So I'm, I'm reading a lot and I'm creating this sort of broad base of just
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.960]   generally potentially useful information.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.320]   All right, too.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.680]   I constantly riff off these things, especially when I'm walking, trying to
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.120]   come up with different ideas or theories.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:19.440]   Now, sometimes I'm responding to something I just heard like, Oh, I just
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.280]   listened to Mark Manson's interview on Tim Ferriss's show, they were talking
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:30.880]   about the, uh, the death of blogs and the rise of YouTube, let me see, you know,
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.040]   as I'm walking to pick up my kids from school, is there like an interesting
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:37.240]   coherent story to talk about evolution of.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.840]   Internet content.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.560]   And maybe there's not, but let me just try it out.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.680]   And I'm doing this all the time.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.160]   Now, again, I talked about in my answer to Scott, I was bred
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.640]   in a lab to be an idea writer.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.520]   So this is just how my mind works, but I'm constantly riffing off ideas.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:54.960]   Eventually an idea will click and this is pure instinct, just through experience.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.320]   Boom.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.280]   Oh, there's something there.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:02.280]   I have the storyline about, uh, the, there's a parallel between the
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:06.360]   transition from blogs to YouTube videos.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:10.520]   There's a parallel between the transitions from the, the penny, the penny
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:14.600]   daily newspaper, the penny press newspaper to radio, because maybe
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.920]   I've read something about that.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.960]   I read Tim Wu's book of, uh, the master switch or something.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.480]   And I kind of learned about that.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.920]   I read his attention merchants book and I bet there's a parallel there.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.760]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.200]   And it clicks.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.320]   I'm like, okay, now I have something that could actually be a complete
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.840]   beginning, middle of end story where everything pulls together.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.680]   At least it has that potential.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.480]   At that point, if I want to work with that, I'll do a little bit more basic research.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:42.560]   Let me see if this rough story I just outlined actually holds up.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:48.000]   Let me go back and reread, uh, my marked notes in that Tim Wu book
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.360]   about the attention merchants.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.960]   Let me go back and actually read, listen to that piece of the
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.680]   interview with Mark and Tim.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.720]   Do I really remember that right?
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.840]   Like what exactly did he say?
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.240]   So I'm doing some sanity checking, some basic research, like does the
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:04.040]   storyline I wrote in my head actually match my remembering properly these sources.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:04.720]   And I'll tell you.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.560]   40% of the time, that's not going to be the case.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:12.000]   I'll go back and read the thing or re-listen to the thing.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.560]   But like, oh, they're actually kind of saying the opposite.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.880]   Like my mind, my mind is so desperate for.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.840]   Find such pleasure in cohesive stories that will sometimes change things.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.280]   And when I go back, I'm like, oh my God, it was actually the opposite.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.680]   But if my basic research kind of confirms, yeah, we have the pieces here for a story.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.080]   Um, at this point I'm ready to pitch it.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.080]   So it's a pitchable story.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.200]   And at some point I might pitch it.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.800]   If I'm going to write it for a magazine, I'll, you know, I'll pitch it to my editor.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.880]   If it's going to be a book chapter or a podcast segment, it's just, you know,
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.280]   there's no one to actually pitch it to.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.800]   I just, it's in my list of like, let's go for this.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:49.440]   Once greenlit, then I will go back and more thoroughly fill in the details.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:53.640]   I get the depth of research needed to actually write about it in a confident way.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:59.360]   For something like a 2000 word New Yorker piece, this might only take a couple of days.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:00.840]   It's like, okay, let me go.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:03.960]   I have like, let me get the transcript of this interview.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.160]   Let me get, uh, this chapter.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.600]   Let me write down my notes from this chapter of this relevant book.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.400]   Let me find three articles and pull out the relevant notes.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:11.600]   Okay.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:15.040]   Now I have enough to actually, uh, support this story.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.400]   If it's a longer piece, you know, like the, uh, New Yorker piece I wrote on natural
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:23.760]   productivity, that was five or 6,000 words, or if it's a long book chapter, this could
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.440]   take longer, maybe even a couple of months.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.400]   I'm working on an article right now.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:32.880]   I won't give any details because it's, I don't give details on things in progress.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.600]   If it's being done for other publications, but just speaking in generalities, I'm
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:41.360]   working on a, in the early stages of a, a potential bigger article now, where I've
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.080]   read five books on it already.
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:49.320]   And I have probably two or three interviews I need to set up before this
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.320]   rough storyline I have in my mind.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.720]   I'll really be able to flesh it out.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.800]   So, you know, it could take a long time or it could take a couple of days.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.480]   It depends on how big of a thing you're writing.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:01.360]   Then I will rework my storyline with this more detailed research.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.320]   And sometimes it's just tweaking it like, okay, actually here's the best beat.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:08.720]   Forget it's not about the penny far, the pending, it's not pending far.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:11.000]   These are bicycle, the penny press.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.280]   So it's not about like the penny press going to the radio.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:20.240]   Actually, the really good story here is, you know, about televisions rise versus
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:25.080]   um, paperback mass market paperback, nonfiction or fiction books or something.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:25.280]   Right.
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.920]   Like you, you might realize like the story is more or less true, but there's
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.640]   better examples to make this, make this true.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.760]   Or there's another angle to it.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.480]   I want to add.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.960]   So I evolved the story.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.920]   Now I have the fully evolved story and I'm ready to write.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.560]   So that's my process.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:45.920]   Uh, on, so that's how I get from, uh, nothing, just a general foundation of
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:48.080]   having lots of interesting thoughts to a finished piece.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:52.240]   All right.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   Let's, um, let's move on.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:54.560]   Jesse.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.040]   All right.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:55.800]   It's time for one more.
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.560]   Another question here, Nicholas from Tucson.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.680]   I haven't heard you talk about much of the symbolism of, for value expression
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.120]   in the pursuit of the deep life.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.280]   If you've held a core value for 10 plus years, then would it be appropriate
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.880]   to celebrate that with a tattoo?
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.840]   A good question.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.920]   You gotta be wary about tattoos.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:19.120]   Um, Nicholas, I regret Jesse's seen it.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:28.360]   I have a full back tattoo of it's a Brandon Sanderson's face and like right
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.520]   under it, you know, like you would have mom with a chair of angel holding it up.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.240]   It says never forget the name of the wind.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.400]   I regret that tattoo.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:40.520]   You know, like I probably should have done like a little bit more research.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.360]   And it was expensive.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.080]   It was expensive.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.760]   Expensive.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.640]   Um, and Brandon, it's really sent a lot of cease and desist letters about, you
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.640]   know, because I go there a lot and try to show them the, show them the tattoo.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.280]   It's show up shirtless outside of his underground layer.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.680]   And then the wind, Brandon, the wind.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.840]   Um, no, Nicholas.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.120]   Okay.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.920]   Broad answer, specific answer, broad answer.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.440]   You're absolutely right.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.960]   That we, we underestimate.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.920]   We often underestimate the value of symbolism, capturing things that are
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.360]   important to us symbolically in objects and the way we set up an office, the
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.440]   things we buy, the things we collect.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.720]   It's really easy to see that through this sort of miserably pragmatic
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.120]   economical ends of why are you wasting money on that?
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.160]   Isn't that an extravagance?
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.120]   But it's actually really important.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.960]   I think to have totems of things that you really care in the three interesting
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.440]   segments, uh, three interesting things segment that follows, I have a really
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.920]   cool example of this, where I'm going to show you something involving
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.000]   the director, Gail, model Toro.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.360]   So stay tuned for that.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.560]   But let me just say more broadly, I think it's.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:51.000]   Makes complete sense to invest in things that do nothing else, but remind you
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.400]   or solidify values that you hold important.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:01.680]   So if you're a writer and you, you invest in expensive first editions
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.080]   of influential books to you, I don't think that's a waste of money.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.800]   I think that's your capturing the written word is important to me,
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.640]   you know, and I really value it.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.080]   I'm thinking about for the HQ, for example.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:19.440]   Um, I want to get a, uh, pre microprocessor arcade cabinet.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.360]   And I actually don't care if the cabinet itself is rebuilt, but I
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.280]   want it to be original circuitry.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.040]   For a game from before there was actually microprocessors.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.600]   I just love this idea of, of analog circuitry being wired up in such a way
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.920]   that you can have it come together and create something like a video game.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.440]   Right.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.800]   And so like, that's nonsense to almost anyone else.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.680]   Like, are you really going to spend that money on asteroids or whatever?
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:50.000]   But to me, there's something symbolic about things I care about with technology
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.760]   and culture and the way technology can, uh, um, alchemize into sort of cultural
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.040]   influence or something bigger than the sum of its parts and as a computer
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.520]   scientist, I really love the history of, of digital electronics before we get to
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:07.440]   the sort of bloodless reality of today of these sort of just processors where
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.200]   one piece of Silicon does everything.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.280]   And the idea of Steve jobs and was the ax sitting there in Atari in the, the
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.600]   mid 1970s, trying to just get together a breakout clone before there was something
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.800]   like a microprocessor to use as just timing circuits and the puzzle of it.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.840]   Like it's symbolic to me.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.120]   And so it's something that I would, I would, you know, invest, invest money in.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.040]   So I'm a big believer in exactly what you suggest here.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.200]   Capturing values in symbolic objects, tattoos, like sure.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.400]   I mean, my, my, my real thing about tattoos is my rule of thumb.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.920]   Uh, wait till you're in your thirties.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:46.320]   Cause when you're getting the tattoo in your twenties, you haven't really
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.200]   developed that full value system yet.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.360]   So then the tattoo might play more of the, the role of like, I'm just so
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.000]   desperate to sort of in the, in the, uh, to individually, that's not the right
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.200]   word, individuate, is that a word to, to, to, to sort of define myself as a unique
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.160]   individual and I like what it signals to other 20 year olds of like, I look like,
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.160]   I don't care, I have this, like I'm really unique and interesting or whatever.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.960]   Uh, but in your twenties are an idiot.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.120]   And, you know, you're going to look back and say, I thought at the
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.960]   time it was really cool to get, uh, deep work forever in a face tattoo.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.560]   But like actually, you know, cows kind of a door.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.160]   Can I regret that?
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:25.360]   Right.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.480]   And by the time you get to your thirties, then it's like, okay, now I kind of have
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.880]   a handle on, I'm not so interested in, you know, Looking cool to the, uh, the,
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.240]   the 24 year old at the bar.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.800]   I have a bigger sense of my values.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.200]   I know a lot of writers who do this.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:44.560]   Ryan Ryan holiday has, um, multiple forearm tattoos from his books.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.640]   I think he has an ego as the enemy, the obstacle is the way.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.000]   Um, you know, he said a four book deal.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.720]   So I guess he's going to have to, I don't know.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   He's going to run out of body parts, you know, at some point, uh, my friend,
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.040]   Brian Johnson, I think did he, he's done.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.040]   So I think I've seen a lot of like forearm tattoos, like writers have done.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.040]   So I'm for it, man.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.800]   I'm for taking big swings and I'm not a tattoo guy myself, but whatever
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.520]   your equivalent is of a tattoo.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.600]   I think taking big swings, the signal to yourself that you take, you care about
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.800]   something or take something, think something's important, I think it's cool.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.560]   There's a real psychology behind it.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.720]   And it's makes life boring.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.480]   If we see that all through the lens of like, is that really strictly necessary?
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.360]   Is that a, is that an indulgence?
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.200]   Is that a contrivance?
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.360]   I mean, life is short and if you're involved in it, it's
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.560]   something that matters to you.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.080]   You know, lean into it.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.640]   I would say by far the most consistent group in my life who
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.040]   has tattoos is actually mom's.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.640]   Really?
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.680]   The kid's names.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.600]   Very common, which makes sense.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:46.840]   Right.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.720]   I mean, they're unlike my Brandon Sanderson name of the wind tattoo.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.040]   There's one thing you could probably be pretty sure that you're not
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.800]   going to like 10 years later, be like, I'm not really that into this anymore.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.400]   We are kids.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:58.840]   Right.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.480]   And it's such like a huge life altering your whole life is
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.960]   like reorienting around this thing.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.680]   A lot of moms have their, it'll be like the initial, it's just subtle.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.160]   The initial somewhere, the name somewhere.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.640]   It was, um, the best tattoo humor.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.280]   So I just got to recommend a clip.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:20.560]   The, the TV show superstore of, if you saw it or if you've seen the show or not,
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.760]   it's from a few years ago, but there's a whole scene there where he wants to get
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:29.560]   his mom's, one of the characters wants to get his mom's face tattooed on his back.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.320]   And she's been learning how to do it, but she's been practicing on melon.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.480]   So it's not going well.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.840]   You know what she does on his actual back.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.000]   So it's a really funny sequence.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.240]   Um, she, she gives him like a top hat and keep it growing the top
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.520]   hat, like cover over the mistake.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520]   He says really funny.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.840]   So in the end, there's like this giant top hat and it's humor guys.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.600]   It's great.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.960]   I recommend that clip.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.400]   All right.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.560]   Um, that's enough questions.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.440]   I want to get the three interesting things.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.960]   I have a couple of cool things I want to show everyone.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:02.640]   First, let me mention another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.920]   It's a tattoo parlor.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.400]   See, that would be synergy.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.160]   That's how you get the real CPMs.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.200]   Jesse is you rebuild your whole show around, uh, the thing
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.040]   you're about to talk to you.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.320]   So our, our tattoo parlor that we're opening downstairs in the old
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.280]   Republic restaurant, we really successful.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.080]   It's all Brandon Sanderson.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:23.480]   Okay.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.440]   Uh, no, no.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.960]   What I really want to talk about is something that's way more pragmatic
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:31.080]   and way more clearly useful stamps.com.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:36.120]   For over 20 years, stamps.com has been indispensable for more
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.480]   than 1 million businesses.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:44.440]   It gives you access to USPS and UPS services that you need to run your
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.160]   business right from your computer.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:50.200]   Anytime, day or night, no lines, no traffic, no waiting.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.760]   You just print your own postage with your normal printer.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.960]   You put it on what you want to ship.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:01.560]   You schedule a pickup, no going to the post office, no going to the UPS store.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.240]   They also have negotiated these large discounts on shipping rates.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.000]   So you end up not only getting more convenience, but saving money as well.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.120]   If you run a business that does any sort of shipping, you
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.520]   have to be using stamps.com.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:22.840]   Don't go to the post office, just print, pay schedule, boom, discount, convenience.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.880]   Most importantly, I think time not to waste that time.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.960]   I can just get this part, this quintessential shallow work task, shipping something.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:37.720]   You want to squeeze that into the smallest possible amount of time as you can.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.400]   So stamps.com is just something you need to have.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.840]   If you do any amount of shipping, this is just a
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.840]   straightforward productivity hack.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.480]   It just makes sense.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.560]   It's one of the easiest pitches I do.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.160]   Don't go to the post office.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:51.960]   You can just do it from home.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.920]   Bam, sign me up.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.400]   Stamps.com is the way to do it.

[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.440]   All right.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.400]   Another sponsor I want to talk about very appropriate for the new year.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.640]   My body tutor.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.680]   My body tutor is a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.880]   in health and fitness, which is lack of consistency.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.120]   It's not hard to figure out what you should be eating.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.200]   It's not hard to figure out a workout plan.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.080]   That's going to make a difference.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:48.200]   What's hard is actually doing it on a regular basis and making the tweaks
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.640]   you need to make it work for your life.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.720]   What my body tutor does, this way it's so smart is that it connects you with
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:58.880]   a coach dedicated to you and they're going to figure out your eating plan.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:02.040]   They're going to figure out your exercise plan, and then you
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.560]   check in with them every day.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.840]   It's a simple app on your phone.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.520]   Boom, boom, boom.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.440]   And they read it and respond every day that gives you accountability.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.640]   And the accountability leads to consistency.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.160]   The consistency leads to results.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:18.120]   It also gives you expert advice.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.840]   So you're like, I'm trying this plan, but like, this isn't working for me.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.000]   Or I'm having a hard time with this part of what we're talking about eating.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:24.880]   You have this coach.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.600]   It's like, let me specifically address that issue.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.200]   Why don't we change this or move the Wednesday things to Thursday, or let's
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.240]   not care so much about this and your diet really what we should do is maybe
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.240]   instead prepackage your lunches.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.800]   You have expert advice to help deal with the specific issues you have in your life.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:44.120]   As you're trying to succeed with these health and fitness goals.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:47.560]   So if you're here in the new year, wanting to get in better shape and
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.680]   you're just going to do it on your own.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.760]   Don't go to my body tutor.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.560]   Get the online coach, work with them every day.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.720]   It's going to work.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.200]   It's what actually works.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.360]   Now here's the good news.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:04.000]   If you mentioned deep questions, when you sign up, they will give
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.600]   you $50 off your first month.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.600]   So just mentioned the, the, the podcast, deep questions when you sign up.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.400]   And if you talk to Adam Gilbert, my old friend, Adam Gilbert, who, who
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.680]   founded my body tutor, tell him, Cal says, hi, that guy is awesome.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.200]   And a really good shape.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.560]   So if you're going to, if you have any resolution, getting better shape,
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:24.200]   let me just make this clear, my body tutor.com mentioned deep questions.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.520]   I think it's the, uh, it's the best way to do it.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:35.680]   Me and the boys, Jesse had been watching a limitless on Disney plus, which is a
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:41.200]   Darren Arfnesky directed, uh, documentary series that follows Chris Hemsworth.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.040]   Thor as he's like, does all as beautifully shot.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:44.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:48.560]   Darren Arnesky is a, a great film director did black Swan and he's, uh, but he's
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:54.160]   been doing these beautifully shot sort of documentary series for national
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.480]   geographic, which Disney owns, cause it's through Fox.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.560]   He did one with Will Smith a couple of years ago.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.000]   Uh, but anyway, so it's a lot of, a lot of Chris, a lot of Chris Hemsworth
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.160]   that made us think about our discussions before about how do these guys, like,
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.960]   how did he get in the shape to be Thor?
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.400]   And, um, let's just say he wasn't doing on his own.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.920]   He had a coach.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.000]   He had a coach.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.480]   I heard some, I heard a whole discussion about Hemsworth about, uh, on the show,
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:26.720]   but not on this show, but on another podcast about there's, uh, some
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.040]   needles that are probably involved.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.840]   I don't want to cast dispersions, but like, supposedly it's a whole dark
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.160]   underside, not dark, but it's just like an underside of these superhero movies.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.360]   Is there's really no way for these guys to get as strong as they do as quick as
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.440]   they do without some aids, which are probably not that healthy, but you got
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.680]   to inject this and check that.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:48.080]   And the whole agreement in the media is just like, don't ask about it.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.640]   It's not like they're, it's not like the rock is saying, I don't use this or
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.880]   Chris Hemsworth to say, I don't use this.
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.560]   They just, just no one talks about it.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.880]   It's just kind of like the price you pay to do these, do these movies.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:03.080]   So if I show up looking like Chris Hemsworth, be suspicious.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.760]   Within the next three months, be suspicious.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.000]   All right.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.560]   Final, uh, final segment of the show.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.440]   Three interesting things.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.520]   This is where we take three things that I found interesting that you have sent to me.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:20.360]   Am I interesting that calnewport.com email address that all relate to the
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.400]   general theme here of trying to live a deep life and I take three, I like, and we look at them.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:31.560]   So if you are listening to this show, you might want to jump over to the YouTube
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.720]   version of the episode because the three things are visual that's
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.200]   youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.720]   We launch a video of the full episode of each podcast, usually the
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.040]   same day that it comes out.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:46.320]   I'll explain in words what's on the screen here, but it's, it's better than
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.280]   Watts, so it's a, it's a good chance to jump over to YouTube.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.000]   All right.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.960]   The first interesting thing I want to talk about is the director, Guillermo
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.640]   del Toro, or as I've discovered his fans, call him GDT.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.400]   His, uh, so-called bleak house.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.680]   All right.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.360]   So I've loaded on the screen now.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.160]   Uh, an article, there's a lot of articles about this.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.720]   This happens to come from a Southern California radio station.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.120]   And the headline here is bleak house, a tour inside Guillermo
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.600]   del Toro's creative man cave.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:21.600]   There is a, a picture of him in a Victorian decorated room
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.160]   with a terrifying monster statue.
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.520]   So here's the subhead.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.880]   I'll read this on the screen right now.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:33.520]   The director behind Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy owns a house filled with
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.360]   artifacts he has collected throughout his life.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:40.120]   Now, the reason why we're hearing about this is there's a exhibit they're now
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.960]   doing where you can come and, uh, a museum exhibit, where you
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.000]   can see a lot of these things.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.720]   But the key thing is before this exhibit, he has a two story house
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.360]   filled with more than 10,000 items.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:56.400]   Artworks, sculptures, artifacts, books, movies collected over a lifetime.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.280]   But he insists he's not collecting for collecting sake.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.760]   So let's dive a little deeper.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.200]   Here's a Guillermo quote.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.680]   This is a religious place for me.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.960]   See, to me, everything that surrounds us is not a collection.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:09.720]   It's a relics.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.400]   It's relics or it's talismans, whatever you want to call them.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.360]   They have a spiritual hold of who I am.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:15.800]   Essentially.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.720]   This goes right back to the question we talked about before the break.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.960]   About the value of having symbolic, symbolic objects to capture your values.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.560]   GDT is getting right to the core of this.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.920]   He sees these things he collects as relics.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.000]   It's, it's a power is being captured in there.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.560]   Uh, where is the bleak house?
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.880]   It's a, in the suburbs.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.800]   He just bought a house in the suburbs of LA near his existing house.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.800]   And he gets into it.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.120]   Um, later in this article, he gets into how this came about.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.080]   He was collecting this stuff because if you know, GDT, he does these,
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.800]   these beautiful, fantastical movies that often have the
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.480]   macabre or terrifying in them.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.000]   So he was collecting these somewhat disturbing objects.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.760]   And at some point his wife very reasonably said, this cannot be in our house.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.400]   Like we have young kids.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.640]   If you want to know what I'm talking about and you're watching on YouTube, I
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.240]   have an example on the page of something that's in his bleak house.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:12.160]   It's, um, it's a, a man's face that has been ripped open and
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.680]   there's like jaws coming out of it.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.760]   It's not the type of stuff you want in your house.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.880]   So he said, fine, I'll buy another house and that's where
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.000]   I'm going to store my collection.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.320]   So he has the second house.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.880]   Here's another big picture I put on the screen.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.640]   It's it's cool, Jesse.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.040]   Look at this.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.960]   It's a, there's a monster, a giant Frankenstein head.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.640]   The whole thing is done up Victorian red walls.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.080]   All the pictures are covered in framed art, but it's like weird macabre, uh,
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:39.120]   sort of, uh, Hieronymus Bosch style artwork, like it's, it's, uh,
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.160]   old lamps and bookcases.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:44.680]   So, um, oh, here's the quote by the way.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:48.440]   Uh, his wife said that's too close to the kitchen.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.520]   The kids are going to get freaked out.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.800]   And he, GDT said inside of me, something cracked.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.200]   And I said, I'm going to get my own place.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.800]   He has a haunted mansion room based off the Disney thing.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.480]   He has a room that simulates a rainstorm outside.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.440]   He has 13 libraries.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.000]   So each room has a different library.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.680]   He used that as a research area.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.080]   So like he, this one opens and you're in a room that's a haunted mansion.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.640]   Uh, but the haunted mansion room has a library.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.600]   That's all about mythology, folklore, fairy tales, and myths, et cetera.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.080]   So he, he, he uses this house.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:24.960]   Not just the capture things that are valuable to him, but also as a, uh,
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.520]   source of creative inspiration.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.120]   So he's not just reading about fairies when he's working on pan's labyrinth.
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.360]   He's in a haunted mansion room, taking these old volumes off of the shelf.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.720]   I think this stuff really matters.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.040]   And I talk about this a lot on the show.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.320]   If you do any sort of creative endeavor where you're trying to alchemize value
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:44.960]   out of the stuff in your mind, environment, metal rituals, matter, objects, matter.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.360]   If you're an accountant, you might say this is crazy.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.720]   You bought a second house just to store stuff, how indulgent or whatever.
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:56.000]   But this is at the core of what GDT does for a living.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.360]   These fantastical, incredibly creative, inspired visual masterpiece style
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.760]   movies, this is just a completely pragmatic investment.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.640]   And I think people might say something similar about the deep work HQ, but
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.280]   for what I do for a living, it's an investment that makes a huge amount of
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.800]   sense to have a place to come to that.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.360]   I'm specifically decorating to celebrate what I care about in terms of cognitive
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.560]   work, to have the ritual of coming here versus somewhere else.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.640]   Uh, the, the, the lab we're building in here.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.920]   I mean, Jesse saw today when he came back from vacation, I bought in a lot
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.760]   more electronics equipment because, um, me and my, my oldest son are building
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.440]   things and that's really important to me and having that connection to.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:40.120]   So it seems completely crazy to, you know, I don't know, like my brother,
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:44.040]   but the me, because of what I do, it's like, of course, I'm going to invest in
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.480]   this, you know, it matters.
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.560]   Symbolic value matters.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.440]   Ritual matters, location matters.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.040]   So anyways, I just think this is cool.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.800]   Um, here's a, I like this picture.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.800]   So for those who are watching, there's a picture of a, a, uh, incredibly scary
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.680]   looking doll on an old Victorian.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:01.840]   Shay's lounge.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.400]   And I just, I want to pull this up because of the photo caption, which just
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:11.120]   reads a couch piled with books and a demonic doll, an awesome photo caption.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.160]   Here's the freak's room.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:14.680]   That guy's there.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.000]   I'm just sure if you're, if you're listening, I'm just showing like
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.240]   terrifying pictures on the screen.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.880]   Here's the simulated rainstorm room.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.080]   Anyways, I put the link to this article in the show notes.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.440]   So, uh, there's Frankenstein drinking tea.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.800]   No Frankenstein's monster.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.640]   I should be precise here.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.960]   Drinking tea film room.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.200]   Anyways, I love that stuff.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.520]   Jesse, who wins GDT's bleak house, Brandon
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.840]   Saracens underground layer.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:42.880]   It seems like GDT had more stuff to look at.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.840]   I think he has to, I think it's right.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.080]   I think he has the cooler house.
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:46.720]   It's Oregon.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:47.360]   It's bigger.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.320]   I love the idea of having themed rooms for different libraries.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.080]   Uh, Sanderson just wins on the coolness factor of being underground.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.800]   Yeah, but it's, yeah.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.960]   I'm going to give, I'll give this one that you also might just be upset.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.560]   Cause he has an answer to your, you know, door knocking when you're outside his house.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.400]   It's just me shirtless.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.960]   So now you're just knocking his layer.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.080]   Screw his layer.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.840]   Screw his layer.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:11.720]   All right.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.240]   Uh, second, interesting thing.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.960]   Let me load up.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:19.440]   I'm switching over to a different aspect or a reader sent this in.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:24.480]   This is the, uh, Nobel lecture.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.720]   So the, the lecture given when you're awarded the Nobel prize, this is the
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:35.240]   transcript of the Nobel lecture given by Carrie Mollis, who won the Nobel prize
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:41.560]   in 1993 for his work on developing the polymerase chain reaction, PCR technology.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.920]   That's at the core of a lot of the genetics explosion.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:49.200]   So it's a cool, it's a cool lecture because he's like going through in detail.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:55.760]   His whole story of how did he get his training, his ups and downs, how he left
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:59.880]   that, he left the academic track to try to become an author that didn't work.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.400]   He worked in restaurants for a while.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.320]   It came back to academia.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:07.600]   It's like, he really gives more detail than I'm used to seeing about building up.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.280]   To something like a Nobel caliber academic career.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.440]   There's just one quote in particular one to point out and
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.840]   I've marked it in this document.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.360]   So I'm just scrolling down to this now on the screen.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.360]   I thought this was cool.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.560]   So he talks about, about halfway through his lecture.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:27.680]   One Friday night I was driving as was my custom from Berkeley up to
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:34.000]   Mendocino where I had a cabin far away from everything off in the woods.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.400]   My girlfriend Jennifer Barnett was asleep.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.880]   I was thinking since, uh, Ogleno nucleotides were not that hard to make
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.280]   anymore, wouldn't it be simple enough to put two of them into a reaction
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.680]   instead of only one, such that one of them would bind to the upper strand
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.200]   and the other to the lower strand with the three prime ends adjacent to the
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.840]   opposing base pair in question, this is the type of things we think, right.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:57.080]   We all think when we're driving up to our cabins, we think about Ogleno nucleotides.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.720]   Um, anyway, so he has some more thoughts and when he finished this thought, he
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:07.000]   realized he had everything he needed to do PCR, which he'd win the Nobel prize for.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.040]   So I just love this idea that he just had the habit of going to
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.400]   a cabin in the woods to think.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:16.280]   And it was going to this cabin in the woods to think that ritual of doing so
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:20.880]   that eventually led to the thought one thought on which his whole Nobel prize
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.600]   winning work was eventually based.
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:25.600]   So again, this goes back to like the bleak house that GDT has.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:29.400]   The accountant or hypothetical accountant says, wait a second.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.840]   You're like a young academic.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.160]   Why do you have a cabin in the woods?
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.480]   What an indulgence, what a waste.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.960]   This is what one of his Nobel prize thinking is hard.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.040]   Creativity is hard.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.680]   Coming up with things in your brain that has great value to
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.440]   the world outside is very hard.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.800]   It needs, this process needs all the help it can get.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:49.920]   So doing these things that seem kind of radical or unnecessary sometimes are
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.800]   exactly what you need to get radically impressive results.
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.680]   I'd have a third thing.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.880]   This is a short, someone sent this to me.
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:00.360]   This was just a, an honor of the Christmas season that just ended.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.600]   I didn't get this in in time last week, but here we go.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.560]   I've written about this a long time ago.
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.840]   I wrote an essay about this, but it's a, um, I've loaded on the screen
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.520]   here was just a note from Reddit.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.320]   Uh, TIL while writing a Christmas Carol.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:20.640]   Charles Dickens was taking nighttime walks of 15 to 20 miles around London
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.240]   to build out the story in his head.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.920]   What's TIL, Jesse.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:29.760]   I kept on looking at it as TDL.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:34.800]   Yours, TDL, yours, the deep life, but I don't know what TIL.
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.320]   It's okay.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.760]   We just, I don't know anything about the internet, but anyways, I've heard
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.120]   this story before and I think it's cool.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.680]   Um, Dickens did a lot.
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:44.440]   He did a lot of work on foot, which I always advocate.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.680]   He's upping this to the next level.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:50.720]   15 to 20 miles is pretty impressive, but this idea that he worked through
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.840]   this masterpiece in his head, as he was moving through the night streets
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.240]   of London, I think is really cool.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.480]   It might not quite be true.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:04.840]   This might be mixing up, uh, an essay that Dickens wrote about his nighttime
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:08.800]   walks in London, where he was talking about how he used these long walks
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.320]   as a cure for an ins about of insomnia.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:14.080]   So I, some of these stories might get mixed up, but let's just keep the
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.360]   pristine folklore in our minds for now.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:21.600]   Him walking through the gas lit streets of London, conjuring up ghosts of the
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:26.240]   Christmas past, present, and future building out this classic story in his
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:31.520]   head, a great Victorian personification of depth and a good holiday story to
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.040]   kind of end the whole holiday season.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:33.560]   So there we go.
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:36.320]   Jesse, that's all we got.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.040]   I got to go send some more photos to Brandon.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.960]   So we should probably wrap this up.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.720]   Uh, thank you everyone who sent in your questions.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.760]   We always want more.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:48.480]   There's a link right in the show notes for how you can go online and send us as
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:51.280]   many questions as you want for us to potentially answer on the show.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:54.200]   Uh, remember if you like what you heard, you will like what you see.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:57.440]   Full episodes and clips are available at youtube.com/calendarportmedia.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:01.640]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the podcast and until
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.360]   then, as always stay deep.
