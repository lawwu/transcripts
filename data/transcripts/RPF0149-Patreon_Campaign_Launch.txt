[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.240]   big thank you to you. Tomorrow is my wife's last day of work after she put in
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.640]   her notice three weeks ago and I owe our new lifestyle mostly to the show and to
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440]   some of the early retirement communities. Let me explain. We have two young
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.720]   children and we we've been both commuting spending about three hours to
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.320]   get them up, get them dressed, get them to daycare, commuting to work, having two
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.680]   cars, all the insurance and everything and after you're listening to your show
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.680]   and really paying more attention to everything from how much taxes we're
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.200]   paying to just some of the your money or your life things that they advocate for
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.320]   in terms of looking at your lifestyle and where your time is going. It's just
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.600]   made me really think about all of these things in a greater detail and I was
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.000]   able to find about $30,000 in savings both from cutting out one car to
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.200]   lowering our tax bill to lowering my student loan payments and all of this
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.560]   was through the inspiration from your show and then my obsessive dedication
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.560]   to kind of crunching numbers and looking closely. So I just want to say that
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.240]   starting Monday morning my quality of life is going to be better than it's
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.480]   ever been where I get to wake up, take an express bus to work while my wife and
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.640]   kids get to sleep in and have a nice breakfast together and I can come home
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.080]   to a little bit more of a peaceful house. So thanks again for all you do and I
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.000]   look forward to all the future shows. Two major pieces of news today. Number one, we
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.280]   have an app and it's very exciting. I'll tell you why. And number two, we're
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.280]   launching a crowdfunding campaign and I would ask you to be involved.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:19.920]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.960]   today is Monday, February 9, 2015. And today my friends, after weeks and weeks
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.840]   and weeks of work and delays and Joshua feeling totally flummoxed by techie stuff,
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.320]   I am thrilled to announce to you some changes in the show and I'm going to ask
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.320]   for your help.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   Let's get straight to it with the launch of our new mobile device app, which I am
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.720]   very excited to tell you about. And then I will tell you about our new crowdfunding
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.920]   campaign and I will ask you to be involved. But I want to lead off with the
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:09.040]   app. As of today, if you are on an Apple iOS device, so iPhone, iPad, or if you have
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.960]   an Android-based device of any type, or if you have a Windows phone, or if you
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.320]   have an Amazon Fire phone, we now have an app. And I would encourage you to check
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.640]   it out. You can download it from the App Store. And let me explain the
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.520]   functionality of it and the reason why I've gone to the trouble of creating it.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.440]   This may be of interest to some of you, especially if you're running or want to
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   start your own podcast and I'll tell you what I've learned. For years, I did most
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.840]   of my podcast listening with an Apple iPhone. And it worked great, especially
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.600]   after Apple came out with their own dedicated podcasts app, which is built in
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.640]   now and released on every brand new iOS device and cannot be deleted, which is
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.680]   great for the business and the science and the industry of...not science, the
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   industry of podcasting. That's a thrilling announcement. I knew that was
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.160]   coming. That was one of the reasons why I started the show and I did, to make sure
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.040]   that I was out there. Because this is leading already to massive growth in the
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.840]   podcast listener sphere. But so for years, I used that app and it's a great app. It
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.640]   does a great job. And I never understood why would anybody have an app? I used to,
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.240]   if you pay any attention to web marketing or work with consumers, you find that
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.680]   people oftentimes, "I want to have an app." Well, what do you want your app to do
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.840]   for you? And web developers quickly poo-poo and make fun of somebody who says,
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.400]   "We just want an app." And they say, "A mobile website is better." And that's
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:38.280]   true, except it's not in podcasting. Let me explain. I never understood how tough
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.520]   it was to listen to a podcast if you weren't already listening to podcasts.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:52.760]   Because for me, it was always easy. But it is not always easy for people who are
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.920]   not already podcast listeners. Again, the Apple Podcast app worked great and I
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.120]   never switched to anything else. But as soon as I created a podcast and I started
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.720]   telling people about my podcast, then I started meeting lots of people who didn't
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.760]   listen to podcasts. And I found out that I had to explain a lot of steps to them.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.960]   I had to say, if you're on an Apple device prior to the release of iOS 8, I had to
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.560]   say to them, "Okay, go in the App Store and search for an app called Podcasts. It
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.400]   has a little purple logo. Install that app and then open it. Then go to the search
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.920]   bar and then search Radical Personal Finance. Scroll down to the bottom and
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.680]   you'll see at the top are podcast episodes and at the bottom are podcasts. And look
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.680]   for the little orange logo for Radical Personal Finance. Click that button. Click
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.640]   subscribe. Now go back to the episodes. Click the feed button or whatever it's
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.680]   called and look through the archives and then pick a couple that look interesting
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.000]   to you. Click download those and then you can listen to them." And that's as easy
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   as it gets. When you go into the Android space, it's worse. And I never knew this
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.680]   until I switched from an iPhone to an Android device. And all of a sudden, you
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.440]   go into the Android space. Now, okay, go into the Google Play Store. Search for an
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.080]   app called Dog Catcher with 2Gs or search for an app called Pocket Casts or what
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.240]   was usually the easiest was search for an app called Stitcher. Now, once you
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.600]   download that, go to the little search button. You get the point. It is
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.040]   horrendously difficult to teach people who aren't tech savvy and who are just
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.200]   learning to operate their phone how to actually operate a – how to get a
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.720]   podcast. And I realized, "Wow, I have got to create something better for this
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.480]   show because I need to make it very easy for people to listen to the show and it's
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.520]   not currently easy." That was one of the – that was the big aha moment that I
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.800]   had. I never understood that before actually starting the show and trying to
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.000]   tell people to listen to my show, how small still the podcast listening audience
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.640]   is. I said I need a solution. The second thing was 100 episodes when I
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.880]   accidentally redirected my iTunes feed to a dead feed and deleted thousands of
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.320]   subscribers. That was a pretty – that was a pretty rough day for a podcaster.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.120]   But if I had had a way other than iTunes to reach people, I realized I could have
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.800]   kept more of my audience base which is leading to other thing – which has – I
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.320]   learned a lot which led to other things that I'm learning especially regarding a
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.160]   newsletter – the newsletter that I'm beefing out and putting a lot more
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.520]   attention on so that I have email addresses for those of you who are
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.640]   listeners to the show. That's another big major focus on. I'll cover that
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.080]   another day. So I realized I needed an app and thankfully my podcast host, Libsyn,
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.240]   came out with a really great service to create an app. And so I've gone through
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.280]   that process and we've released the – we've released the app. And I welcome
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.720]   you. Go to the store and check it out. As of today, February 9, 2015, it should be
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.200]   live. At the time of recording the show, it's not live in the iOS store. I've
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.000]   just finally gotten the final approval. But it should be live within 24 hours. So
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.600]   I'm guessing by the time this goes out and by the time you hear it, then it will
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.960]   be there in the iOS store. But it is presently there in the Amazon Fire store
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.880]   and it's also presently there in the Google Play store. So what does it do?
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.280]   Well, basically it just gives you direct access to the episodes of the show. It
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.360]   also gives you easy connection to all of the show's online social media presence.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.600]   You can easily email the show. You can easily call the show right from the app.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.920]   And it does have some functionality where I can release some extra bonus content
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.600]   which I plan to do in the future as I can work on that. So I can release extra
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.160]   bonus content there right in that app. If you already have a podcast listening
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.080]   solution that you're happy with, stick with that. There's no reason for you
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.440]   necessarily to go and change this app unless you just want to check it out and
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.280]   see. But it doesn't matter to me whether you listen to my show in the Apple
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.360]   Podcast app, listen to my show in Pocket Cast or whatever app you use already.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.960]   Your Stitcher is fine. It doesn't matter. Just go with that. But here's the deal.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.680]   If you want to tell somebody about the show, here's what you need to know. All
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.680]   they need to know now is they need to have a smartphone and you simply need to
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.400]   tell them, "Go to your app store." It doesn't matter what smartphone with the
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.760]   exception of Blackberry which is very few. Just tell them, "Go to the app store
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.880]   and search Radical Personal Finance and download the app." That's all they need
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.040]   to do. And that's the reason I created an application is I needed it to be
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.280]   possible for you to tell somebody that. And now going forward, this is going to
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.240]   dramatically improve my life. And so now when my mother who listens to this show
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.120]   is wanting to talk to one of her friends who just got a smartphone and is
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.040]   figuring out how to text, she can just simply say, "Go to the app store and
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.680]   search Radical Personal Finance and you can listen to Joshua's show." So that is
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.280]   the reason for the app. Check it out. Give me your feedback. It's not intended
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.160]   to be any fancy personal finance application. That stuff, maybe I can build
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.040]   that out in the future. I certainly have my ideas but that's not a current
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.880]   priority for me. This is just a way for you to spread the show. So please use
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.120]   this now as an easy point of entry. Tell anybody who has a smartphone who you
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.080]   want to listen to the show, tell them, "Download Radical Personal Finance from
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.760]   the app store," and they're in. They're gold and they can listen to the show.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.440]   Now let's get to our crowdfunding campaign. And I've been hinting at this for
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:30.280]   the last few weeks on the show where I've mentioned that I was updating the
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.720]   membership program, the Irregulars program. And I'm going to share this with
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.200]   you as I launch this new crowdfunding campaign that I'm doing using a site
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.800]   called Patreon. But I want to give you just a quick back story on it so you
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.880]   understand. So over the first 100 episodes of the show, I was primarily
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.040]   kind of trying to figure out how do I learn to be a better broadcaster? How do
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.200]   I learn to put together better content? And then I felt over time that we had
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:00.360]   reached kind of a basic level of listenership where either A, I could go
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.240]   ahead and launch a sponsorship program, advertising revenue, or I could come to
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.120]   the audience and ask the audience to support. And I am most comfortable with
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.280]   coming directly to the audience. And the reason is because of the industry in
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.680]   which I talk and the industry in which I deal. And not only is the professional
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.840]   financial advice industry rife with conflict of interest, and I'm aware of
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:28.360]   that. I talk about that constantly on the show. But even just financial media is
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:35.080]   rife with conflict of interest. And as the landscape changes and as the older
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.360]   traditional media loses much of its luster and loses much of its impact over
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.280]   the general population, there are a lot of changes going on in the so-called new
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:50.040]   media of independently created content, some of which are great, some of which
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.800]   are not. But one of the ones that's not is there's a lot of unsclosed conflict
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.200]   of interest. And especially I believe, I take very seriously when you're working
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.680]   in the financial advice space, that you need to be careful with that. And I just
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:10.120]   simply want to be as careful as I can. So when I was working through those, my
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.120]   ideas, and I'm thinking about what do I do? Do I bring on sponsorships? Do I do
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.960]   affiliate relationships and set up affiliate links for products and services
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.840]   that I endorse? I realized that I want my interests to be aligned purely with the
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.920]   audience. And so I want it as a base, at the very least, of any kind of
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.920]   compensation from the show. I wanted a base to be directly to serve the
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.560]   audience. And I came up with the idea of a membership program. And I modeled this
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:41.400]   based upon a couple of other podcasts that I listened to, the primary of which
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.200]   one was Jack Spirico's podcast called The Survival Podcast, of how he had
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.720]   structured his show that really inspired me. And I loved how he's done it over the
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:55.240]   years. And I modeled mine on that. And in many ways, it was a raving success. And
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.480]   in many ways, it didn't work well. Let me start with first, even just the
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.680]   launch. The launch of this was a bit flawed on my end. And it was flawed for
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.080]   multiple reasons. I just didn't do a very good job with it. I wanted to launch
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.280]   on episode 100 because I thought that would be an exciting episode 100, a nice
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.760]   milestone in the show's history. But I made some serious mistakes. The first
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.200]   one I already mentioned when talking about the app, on episode, I think it was
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:30.120]   97, I deleted every iTunes subscriber that I had. And this also affected many of
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.200]   the Android listeners. And to this day, I'm still fixing, trying to fix some of
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.760]   the dead links that exist out there in the internet because of my bad link
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.400]   redirects. And it's still not done. So that was a problem where I'm getting
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.440]   ready and I was announcing, "Oh, we're going to have a big launch, big launch."
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.120]   And I received email after email, "Joshua, I was looking for episode 100. Where'd
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:56.200]   you go?" I had to kind of tell everybody. So that was pretty rough. And so that
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.600]   led to kind of a slower launch than I had expected. But even with that mistake,
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.440]   well, the other kind of problems up front was I didn't know exactly, I wasn't
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.480]   launching with a great big product base of here's the product that I'm going to
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.880]   be releasing for the members. It was just I launched with a promise that I would
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.600]   do things in the future. Even with that, I would say the launch was really, really
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:24.360]   great. And it created something called the Irregulars. And to date, I have 82
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.080]   awesome, awesome people that signed up to support the show at a level of $10 a
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:37.640]   month. That blew me away that 82 of you would sign up to do that. And many of the
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:43.240]   Irregulars started with the deal that I offered for 99 bucks for the first year,
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.480]   which was great because it gave me a little bit of capital for the show and just
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.320]   allowed me to prove the concept that people out there are gaining enough
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.760]   benefit from this show that they're willing to support it financially. That
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:04.200]   is awesome. The challenge that I faced was that I promised on the show page that
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.000]   there would be lots of extra content, but I didn't have any extra content ready
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.760]   to go. So the sales page just simply said – and I did not do a good job even with
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.920]   the launch from a sales perspective. I had a page that said "Membership." I
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.720]   posted a two-hour podcast episode of Joshua rambling on about all the things I
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.520]   don't like about most of the compensation models in the industry. And then I
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.000]   simply said, "I don't have anything there in the membership site for you." And
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.920]   then when people signed up for the membership site, on the other side it
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.440]   simply said, "Thank you for your support. I'll get something here for you soon."
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.160]   And still, there were 82 awesome supporters of the show that set that up for
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.960]   me. I immediately started hearing from the audience and I immediately wondered
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.880]   if I had done the right thing. So the first challenge that I faced was I really
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.440]   didn't want to receive donations. I don't want to put a "Donate" button on the
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.400]   site because I don't want charity. I want to be paid for my work but I don't
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:17.000]   want charity. I appreciate it but I don't need charity. I'm a healthy, equipped,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   capable man. I need to work for my living. So I didn't need charity. And I
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.160]   mentioned that on that show and immediately I got some feedback from the
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:36.840]   audience. I got a voicemail from Derek and several emails that said, "Hey,
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.040]   Joshua, listen. It's not charity for us to send you money. We're just simply
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.960]   thanking you with our dollars. We're sending you certificates of appreciation
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.720]   with presidents printed on them, the virtual version thereof, and thanks for
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.840]   the content you're already creating. So you just put a "Donate" button there.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.680]   That's not charity in and of itself." And so I said, "Wow, okay. That's true."
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.840]   And I see the value of that. So I immediately wondered if I had done the
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:10.440]   right thing. The next challenge that I faced was I received lots of emails from
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:17.320]   people saying, "I want to support you but $10 a month is just either beyond my
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:23.880]   financial capacity right now or it is beyond – it's just more than I'm ready
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.920]   to commit to." For example, on a show like this, which I respect like crazy,
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:34.840]   but on a show like this, hopefully you guys and gals as listeners are being
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:40.440]   transformed from maybe you come in as a profligate spender and we're steadily
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.920]   transforming you into a goal-focused tightwad where you're only spending
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.080]   money in line with your goals. Well, then for some people, $10 a month
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.120]   matters. You put that into the thing I preach constantly on the show and you
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.640]   say, "Well, if I'm going to support Joshua at $10 a month, then I need $3,000
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.840]   of investment capital to support him in financial independence. And my hope is
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:09.320]   that I give you in excess of – far in excess of $100 of value every month."
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.240]   Frankly, I'd love it. I've received emails that it's been thousands of
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:20.920]   dollars of value. But some of you, just $10 was too much. And I had no way to
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.400]   test the price point actually. I had no way – usually what I would like to do
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.320]   in launching something like that would be to do some sort of market test and see
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:35.960]   does the market respond well at $5 a month or at $50 a month and do an A/B
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.320]   split test between those and figure out what does the market say. That would be
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.240]   how a good marketer would approach it. I didn't have any mechanism for where I
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.080]   could do that. So I just picked $10 a month out of the air and I said, "I know
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.160]   I can deliver far in excess of that of value and it seems like a number. I've
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.320]   paid more than $10 a month from any subscription websites and I have several
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.840]   that I subscribe to that are $10 a month." And it just made sense to me.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.560]   So I also wondered, "OK, do I have the right price point?" I didn't have any
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:12.120]   way to test the price point. Other problems, frankly, because the technology
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.440]   was a bit clunky, I was using a membership site to set up, but it just
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.600]   wasn't working well with my site, which is in the process of being redesigned.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.160]   I've got to get a better site loaded up.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.840]   Oh, and then other things is I had listeners reach out to me directly. I had
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:34.040]   some very valued listeners, you know who you are and I thank you personally,
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.440]   for who simply said, "We want to send you some money." They wrote to me and
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.080]   asked for my address and I had promised to publish that, but they wrote to me
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.440]   and sent me some donations and just said, "Thank you. I've received lots of
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.320]   value already and I wanted to share that with you."
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:55.720]   So I knew that I was kind of doing some things not so well, but the big problem
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:01.480]   was the promise that I made. And the promise that I made for the Irregulars
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.040]   program was a promise of additional bonus content. Because of the way that I
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.320]   said it in the episode and even in the sales copy, I said, "I'm going to create
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   some additional members only resources here for you that will benefit you."
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.320]   But when I launched, I didn't have any resources that were there.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:26.520]   And I wasn't quite able to figure out how do I create these based upon the
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.720]   size of the membership program. Here's what would happen. I've got ideas in my
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.800]   head for dozens of courses that I could create. Some topics of which I've talked
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.160]   about on the show, but that I could tighten them up, bring together multiple
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.240]   shows and create a life-changing course for somebody. Some topics which I
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.840]   haven't covered on the show that are quite technical or maybe more suitable
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:50.200]   for a visual presentation. But the sheer investment of my time, of the number of
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.800]   hours that I have available per week, it's tough to know where to allocate
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:01.400]   those hours. So I plan on pretty much about a 60-hour work week. I've got 168
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.480]   hours in my week just like you do. And I think somewhere around 60 hours is a
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.320]   pretty decent amount of time to be working. The advantages that I have is I
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.360]   don't have a commute. I can start early in the morning. And so when I look at
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.720]   how do I divide those 60 hours up, I currently have 24 of them committed to
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.960]   the contract that I have that pays my bills while I start this show. And that
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.040]   leaves me with a total of 36 hours that I can devote toward creating content
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:33.160]   for the show. The types of shows that I do are fairly – they're very time
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.000]   consuming to create. And they're time consuming for a couple of reasons.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.360]   Number one, my shows are long. That in and of itself is time consuming. And due
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.440]   to the format, I feel it's an appropriate format for some of the depth of
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.760]   content that we get into. But my shows are long. Number two, there's a lot of
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.240]   them. So there's a new show basically Monday through Friday. The last few
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.520]   weeks, there have been four shows per week. But basically Monday through
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:05.080]   Friday is my publishing schedule. The content is very in-depth on most of the
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.880]   shows that I do. And that takes time. For example, if I was going – the Friday
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.040]   Q&A shows, if you listen to how I do them, I often will take about 15 to 20
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:19.560]   minutes to answer a question. Well, the reason is because I go fairly in-depth
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.480]   and I try to organize my in-depth comments in a way that makes sense. If I
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.840]   give a cursory two or three-minute interview like – answer like I would on
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.520]   the radio show, then I can just do that off the top of my head and I could sit
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.600]   down with a list of a dozen questions and do that. But to prepare a little bit
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.640]   of an outline for a 15 or 20-minute answer to a question, it takes some time.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:46.040]   The interview shows are generally not very time-consuming, which is why – by
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.720]   the way, there's such a proliferation of interview podcasts. Those are –
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.480]   interview shows are relatively easy to do. And I think they bring a great value
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.360]   which is why I like doing them to the listener. And I try to do them well. I'm
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.160]   getting better. Some of them I'm not satisfied with or some of them I am. But
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.400]   I try to do them well. But even to do them well requires some preparation to
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.360]   be prepared with what's a line of questioning that I'm going to lead in,
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.880]   what is some – the body of work, where is somebody knowledgeable that would be
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:18.840]   interesting to an audience, scheduling it, doing the preparation before, putting
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.200]   the show together, doing the intros, doing the outros, editing the audio.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.280]   Just it's time-consuming. So even an interview show, probably I would
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:33.000]   estimate for me to do an hour interview show takes on average – well, an hour
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.880]   to – I don't do hour-long interview shows. They're always an hour and a
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.760]   half and I always talk with the person for another 20 minutes on top of that.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.720]   So there's two hours right there for the actual call. 30 to 60 minutes of prep
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:48.120]   in advance and then 30 to 60 minutes of audio editing and show notes. So an
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:54.120]   interview show is easily four hours. The content shows that I create, to do
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.080]   them well takes a substantial amount of time to bring together and figure out
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.320]   how am I going to convey this topic in a way that is comprehensive and yet
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:08.520]   understandable. It takes a lot of time to prepare those shows, which is why in
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.120]   weeks like last week when – just as an example, I released four interviews
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.480]   last week. I don't want my show to become the interview central show. But I
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:23.000]   was working on writing webpages, building out the site for the Patreon site,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.200]   working on marketing projects, filming videos. I simply didn't have the day
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.280]   available that it takes me to prepare a Wednesday show. It's easily six to
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.600]   eight hours of preparation for my Wednesday technical financial planning
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:43.880]   shows. So the conflict with the Irregulars program is that I'm spending a lot
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:49.240]   of time focused on building content for the show and I'm feeling guilty about
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.680]   not creating courses. So I'm constantly feeling guilty about not creating
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.920]   courses. But I've set the expectation and I've done it intentionally. I'm not
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.280]   crying or whining about any of this. I've set the expectation that I'm going to
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:07.720]   release Radical Personal Finance five days a week and that is what my focus is.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.160]   So I simply by the end of the week with the number of hours that I have, I
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:18.200]   haven't had a lot of time available with my time budget to commit toward
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.000]   creating courses and answering comments and redesigning the website and all
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.040]   this other stuff, which is fine. This is what all entrepreneurs face and again,
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.880]   this is normal to life. But I realized I'd created a problematic incentive. If
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.440]   my commitment to my Irregulars program was to create additional content, then I
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.640]   needed to cut back on the number of shows that I'm creating simply to free up
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   the hours in the week. Or if my commitment is to the show, I need to
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:49.480]   figure out a way to serve that audience and not disappoint expectations there
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:55.400]   serving that audience and that cuts into the course time. So months went by and
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.600]   I haven't even created a single course. So finally in January, I knew I was
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.040]   having this problem and I would feel guilty every time I thought about the
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.800]   Irregulars program, which led to me promoting it poorly on the show. So
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:14.160]   instead of giving you an excellent committed sales pitch during every show
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.160]   outlining the benefits of the Irregulars program, well, the benefits was, "Hey,
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.120]   can you toss me some money?" And that led to me feeling a little bit embarrassed
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.960]   about my failing commitment to my Irregulars. And so that led to me doing
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.040]   poor promotion on the show and constantly feeling guilty about it even when I did
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:38.440]   promote it because I had made a promise that I wasn't fulfilling. So I surveyed
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.200]   my Irregulars members with an email and I got a lot of awesome responses. And
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.920]   thank you to each and every one of you who responded to that. But what I learned
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:53.120]   from that survey when I asked my members, I said, "What can I create?" The majority
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.040]   answer that I received was, "I don't particularly care about your creating
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.480]   anything more. I like the show and I just wanted to send you some money to
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:09.000]   support the show." And I realized I needed to change course and I needed to align
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.160]   the incentives for the show and create a way for the show to actually pay for
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:20.920]   itself in order to fund my actual activity of it rather than building
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:28.760]   everything on the... everything on extra products and everything on the Irregulars
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.720]   program. The other problem with the Irregulars program, number one, not only
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.320]   was I creating a conflict of interest with the amount of hours that I had, but
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.480]   because of kind of setting the impression, although I don't think I explicitly
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.200]   promised it because I didn't intend to if I did, but setting the impression that I
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.240]   was going to be releasing extra courses as a benefit specifically for the
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:54.320]   Irregulars. They're simply with $10 a month and where I was at with... where I am
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.280]   at right now with about 82 subscribers, I simply... there's not enough financial
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.320]   incentive there for me to spend the 20 or 30 hours to create a course, whether
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.440]   that's, you know, even if... let's just assume a four-hour course, well done one,
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:14.040]   by the time it's created, you know, it's built, it's written, it's created, it's
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.120]   recorded or whatever, you know, whatever the course is, I can't imagine doing one
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.600]   in fewer than 20 hours. And there's not enough financial incentive there for me
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:28.480]   to set that up and actually do it for the listeners of the show. Excuse me, for
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.160]   the Irregulars, based upon the amount of revenue, and I realized I was severely
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:37.880]   underpricing my Irregulars program. So all of these things led to this conflict
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.920]   and I gave it a lot of thought and I realized that I need... I basically have a
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:47.760]   couple of options available to me. I either need to at this point in the show,
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.960]   I need to transition to building out much more paid content and using the
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.860]   platform that I've built with Radical Personal Finance for other means. So for
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.520]   example, building courses, building, you know, doing speaking engagements, doing
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.560]   paid things like that, and using the base that I've built with Radical
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.120]   Personal Finance and jump into those areas. But if I do that, I need to cut
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.720]   back on the amount of time that I'm doing on the show. There's no question
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.800]   about it, I'm doing a thousand episodes of the show. Unless I'm dead, I'm doing a
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:25.320]   thousand episodes. But the timeline of those episodes is... I'm not sure. I don't
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.800]   really want to do that because I love doing the daily show that I do. I really
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.640]   enjoy focusing on that and so that I want to focus on still continuing to
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   create this show. Well that brings up the need then to focus on building the show
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:44.960]   and making the show itself as a product profitable, which leads to a couple of
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:52.040]   options. It leads to most realistically advertisers and sponsorships and that
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.960]   right now is a very viable option. I've had advertisers approach me, multiple
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.440]   ones. I've negotiated certain things with some of them and I am willing to bring
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.400]   on advertisers as long as it's a personal endorsement by me. I'm willing
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.040]   to bring on advertisers but I've been slow to do that and the reason I've been
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.760]   slow is A) I think advertisers will dilute the show and I just don't love
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:19.960]   listening to advertisers myself. I generally skip them on podcasting when I
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:25.080]   listen to them. I usually skip them myself and so I don't... I just don't love
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.920]   diluting the content of the show. And then number two is I just despise how
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:35.440]   people often in many businesses often only talk about a certain aspect of
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.480]   advertising and I'm not saying it's necessarily unethical. I don't see any
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:44.160]   other way around it but I just despise how it's done and I feel cheated when
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.960]   people do it in the way that many people do it. I'll give you an example. This is
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.120]   one that really has bothered me. When I set up my site and I set up my show, I
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.240]   didn't know what I was... I never set up a WordPress site. I never set up a blog
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.600]   site. I'm not a techie. I'm a financial planner. So and I was doing it myself so
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.160]   I just say well what do people recommend? So I start just going with what
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.800]   people recommend. Well if you haven't noticed and if you will... if you haven't
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.320]   noticed it's only because you don't pay any attention to like the online
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.160]   business world. But if you pay any attention to the online business world
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.120]   you immediately find that there's one hosting provider that everybody
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.640]   recommends and that hosting provider is a company called Bluehost. Now it wasn't
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.080]   until I actually you know went through somebody's affiliate
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.320]   link, set up a Bluehost account, set up my site on Bluehost, paid my few dollars a
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.920]   month for it, until I actually found somebody that was technical enough and
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.640]   they said "Oh why did you go with Bluehost?" I said "Well everyone said that."
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.200]   Well what I've since learned is that Bluehost simply pays
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.640]   the highest commissions in the web hosting space and there's nothing wrong
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:54.000]   with their service but it's cheap. And quickly enough if you're on Bluehost and
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.680]   if your site gains any traction you will have to transition from cheap to good.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:05.280]   And I felt betrayed because I wish somebody had told me that there was
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.440]   cheap and there was good and laid out simply and said "If you want cheap here's
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.920]   an affiliate link I've set up with Bluehost and if you want good here's an
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.280]   affiliate link I've set up with another company and if you want great here's an
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.120]   affiliate link I've set up with another company and you pick." But it's tough for
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.960]   people promoting online web stuff to do that. That's so... well Bluehost you know is
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:31.280]   this is my recommendation and you only find out after the fact that "Wait a
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:36.240]   second Bluehost may pay a great commission but they're not necessarily
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:40.400]   great." Now I don't care... so this is... people have this beef with the financial
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.800]   business and I think they should. I think that you know financial advisors should
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.080]   be held to account of "Are you selling the product that has the highest
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.600]   commission or are you selling the product that is the best in this set of
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.480]   circumstances?" That's what I expect as an ethical point of view from financial
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.680]   advisors and I also expect the same thing from everybody else. If you're
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.000]   gonna get mad at financial advisors, if you're gonna get mad at people like me
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.880]   who have sold lots of commissioned products, lots of commissioned insurance,
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.080]   I have sold some commissioned investments, not all the investment
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.240]   products that I sold were fee only which is the thing that everyone thinks you
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.200]   know fills all the conflicts of interest, it doesn't. But I expect the same from
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.760]   everyone else and I expect someone to say "If you want cheap here's Bluehost
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.400]   if you want good here's this company if you want great here's this company and
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:37.640]   they're more expensive let me choose." And nobody does that. And which by the way
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.920]   if you're wondering why most blogs have the little how to set up a blog here's
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:45.120]   my little tutorial which is fine that works just tell people that's why you're
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:50.800]   doing it. Why can't... I would buy I specifically go out of my way to support
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.640]   people with their affiliate links when they recommend products because I want
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.080]   them to get money and many of you do the same for me I don't have any affiliate
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.920]   links other than the Amazon links that I put in the show but you go out of your
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.360]   way to send me money again I've had listeners send me checks and I thank you
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.800]   for that because that's how I believe it should be. I go out of my way to do that
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.720]   for people that bring value to me just tell me about it and so that's my
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.120]   trouble with sponsorships is for me to do sponsorships I got to do them in my
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.360]   way and that's you know hey this is the unique situation in which this this
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.160]   sponsor can serve you this is the unique selling proposition to this sponsor
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.040]   they're not the best at this they're not the best at that they're not the best at
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:36.440]   the third thing but they are great at this and that's the kind of sponsor that
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.880]   I can take on but that's tough to negotiate those sponsorship agreements
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.280]   and it's tough to feel confident tell your sponsors that and it's tough to
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.520]   also feel confident that that you've got enough you know of an audience in this
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:53.960]   niche topic here where hey if you need this niche financial service service
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:59.880]   then here is who you can approach so I'm willing to bring on sponsors in fact I
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.920]   I'm willing to but I don't really want to I want to be more than anything I
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.360]   want to be the consumer reports of financial media I don't want the
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.800]   conflicts of interest that's the other thing it is this sounds this is
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:18.000]   self-serving but this is the other thing having spent so long dealing with
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.720]   conflicts of interest because there are plenty in financial business and having
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:27.560]   spent so long fighting to do a good job and declare them and expose them and let
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.840]   the client choose and simply convey things factually explain here are my
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.320]   conflicts here's where I'm at now you are now armed with the information you
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.800]   need here's my recommendation here are the potential conflicts of interest and
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.640]   I I'm a you probably heard me do it on the show a bit of a stickler about it
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.560]   for example if I'm talking about you know Josh was opinion on life insurance
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.200]   I lead in which my opinion on life insurance is I think the majority of
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.280]   people should probably have a lot of it now I'm biased I used to say this every
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.120]   time I'm biased I sell life insurance I have a conflict of interest so you have
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.320]   to factor that in to the advice that I'm giving is Joshua saying everybody should
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.600]   have lots of term life insurance because he sells term life insurance or because
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.680]   he believes everyone should tell certain life insurance and I do that with
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.000]   everything try to explain my bias and explain the potential bias so that you
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.680]   can understand and make a decision and that's what I expect from other people
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.920]   so I've got a lead by example and illustrate those ethics for other people
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:31.740]   as well so let me stay on task so if I if I bring on sponsors then I will
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.600]   clearly say where this specific sponsor is a fit and also clearly say where
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.080]   they're not well that does make it challenging to bring out sponsors but
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.760]   the biggest thing excuse me I got off track with my line of thought what I'm
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.160]   saying is after so many years of working in a heavily conflict-laden perspective
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.440]   to have a microphone where you can say anything you want and you're responsible
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.320]   for the blowback that you create no matter what that is that is an awesome
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:05.320]   feeling it is a very freeing feeling and it's been years since I since I enjoyed
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.880]   that and I enjoy it now it's nice because then the only person that I have
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.160]   to pay attention to is I have to look and say do I believe what I'm about to
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.480]   say and am I willing to say and take the potential blowback do I believe this
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:29.040]   intensely enough if I do I can say it no matter how radical it is no matter how
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.440]   mainstream it is no matter what it is no matter what the topic is and I have to
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:40.960]   deal with the results and you as an audience member always are always free
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:47.000]   to simply hit fast forward or delete or unsubscribe I love that model I love
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.400]   that model because it leaves you fully with the choice and me with the choice
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.920]   then I can express myself and I can fight to support my opinions and explain
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.640]   to you the logic of my argument and then leave you free to make the decision
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.840]   that's right for you so I would love to be able to say stay as the consumer
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.040]   reports of financial media that's that's what I would love to do because then I
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:15.200]   can deliver to you a complete unfiltered view and if I end unfilter is not always
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.120]   great if somebody just has some stupid offensive opinion that's not backed up
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.440]   by anything I don't I don't appreciate listening to that I want someone if they
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.840]   have if somebody has an extreme or even potentially offensive opinion on
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.440]   something at least explain it and let me understand your logic let me understand
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:43.720]   your argument so so what all of that blows comes down to is I decided the
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.160]   best thing for the show at this point is to launch a patreon campaign
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:52.560]   campaign let me explain what patreon is and why I love this model and why what
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:57.320]   I'm doing with it and how I'm hoping you will be involved patreon is
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:05.720]   essentially a crowdfunding site similar in some ways to Kickstarter or what's
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:12.640]   that other one Indiegogo but instead of being focused on a large project it's
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:20.400]   focused on ongoing creations essentially it's a way for the audience of somebody's
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:26.760]   audience to support the creator the content creator directly for the
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:31.560]   creation it was started by a guy named to the best of my research it was the
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:35.640]   primary person behind it was a man named Jack Conte who was a musician and he
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:40.400]   produces various music videos which are fascinating the stuff he does with his
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.200]   music videos on YouTube and he just realized like there should be a better
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.360]   way so he created patreon and it's a way for individuals where each time he
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.360]   publishes a music video individuals can pledge a certain amount that they're
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.720]   going to pay for that music video and it can be you know a dollar or it can be
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.840]   you know it could be frankly any amount but they pledge that and then when he
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.400]   delivers the creation then they get charged and this allows a content
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.640]   creator to build what is the most important thing which is essentially an
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:15.720]   ongoing salary an ongoing financial support base in when you're running your
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:19.240]   own personal household or when you're running a business the toughest thing to
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:24.000]   handle is your cash flow and having a consistent cash flow gives you an
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.840]   incredible freedom to be able to invest and to move into certain things but if
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.520]   you don't know what your consistent cash flow is you're doing everything based
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.520]   upon savings you're doing it and you don't know how you can invest in a
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.080]   certain area take your content in a way that that that you're looking to go so a
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.800]   patreon allows this allows you the listener to choose a monthly amount that
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.400]   you decide this show is worth well you could be a dollar a month that can be
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.520]   hundreds of dollars a month anywhere in between and then it allows you to pledge
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:59.840]   it and then as I deliver you get billed for it and your fun your money goes
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:06.680]   directly from you directly to me with a small service fee and transaction fees
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.040]   pulled out by patreon and their fees are very reasonable all companies have fees
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.280]   so for example PayPal what is a pay three percent I think with the PayPal
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.320]   fees all of the the credit card processors everyone has their fees but
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:25.600]   it's very very very very useful and I love this idea and I feel like it's
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.400]   serve it's gonna serve you the audience in the best way and so that's why I'm
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.960]   focusing on it it's gonna serve you in the best way because it allows you to
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.360]   choose a monthly amount that's right for you again I've received many emails and
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.360]   contact information from you guys saying I can't do $10 a month but I really want
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.000]   to send you something I want to send a dollar a month or five dollars a month
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.960]   with this platform every single person can spend a dollar a month or you know
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.400]   if that's what you want to do or two dollars a month or five dollars a month
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.720]   whatever amount you decide this show is worth and I'm grateful for any amount
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:06.560]   and it also allows me to set up and to set up some incentives for you at
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.640]   different levels where you are specifically aligned and able to
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.080]   specifically able to support things and have the incentives aligned with the
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.520]   show so if you look at the patreon page and the best way to find it is go to
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.760]   radical personal finance dot com slash patron and that's so that you can become
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.120]   a patron of the show if you look at the patreon pages I've set it up I've set up
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.200]   a number of incentives so for example if you pledge a dollar a month that comes
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.240]   out to essentially five cents a show and now you get access to an exclusive
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.840]   activity feed which is similar to Facebook where I post all the
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.520]   behind-the-scenes information on all things radical personal finance so I'm
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.440]   focusing on producing a lot of I'm gonna try to produce more and more access of
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:55.240]   behind-the-scenes stuff directly to support to those who are supporting the
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:00.440]   show you also get first dibs and I'll set up a discount system for the courses
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.880]   as I develop them in the future I do still hope to develop courses I've just
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.680]   got a it's just a matter of an alignment of my of my time and figuring out what's
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.600]   the best thing if you do you know three dollars a month I've got additional
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.320]   incentives there you get the top next day's topic in advance so I'll be
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.720]   releasing the topic for whatever tomorrow's show is in advance you can
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.040]   comment on it you can ask questions and I'll try to weave that in and directly
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:26.720]   maybe address your concerns in that show five dollars a month your question will
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.840]   get priority in my Friday Q&A shows at this point I have too many questions for
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:36.640]   to answer to answer with on my Friday shows and so I have to pick and choose
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:43.120]   and I can filter I usually filter them based upon content of specifically what's
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.000]   applicable to the audience what I think the audience will most be interested in
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.080]   and will benefit from but this will allow me to give a priority to those who
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.440]   are patrons of the show ten dollars a month there then I'm going to set up a
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.080]   free monthly live Google Hangout where I'll take questions and I'll answer
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:05.760]   everything interactively with the audience $25 a month that's the new
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:11.400]   irregulars program and so I've increased the cost for the irregulars program from
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:17.800]   $10 to $25 and here this is the level at which I'm viewing essentially still the
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:22.160]   irregulars program which I think of as my board of directors and all of the
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.760]   that's who I'm primarily responsible to in my mind and to be clear those of you
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:31.240]   who are already supporting the show with the irregulars program your costs will
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:35.440]   never go up for this program that's what I'm planning is I'm gonna keep it still
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.920]   a little bit wonky to integrate the technology but what I'm working to do is
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.280]   to just thank you for the initial support that you gave for the show
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.920]   because that means the world to me the big benefit you get all those other
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   benefits for the irregulars program that you get all the benefits of the the
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:57.040]   irregulars program but in addition to the you know the other stuff you get
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.520]   access to our private irregulars Facebook group and what I wanted to do
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.800]   was to create a forum but I wasn't able to get that to work well so we've
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.200]   created a private Facebook group and every irregular has access to that to
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.520]   closed group you can't find it if you go search on Facebook you can't act you
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.480]   can't join it unless you receive an invitation but I am spending the
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:20.520]   majority of my time in there trying to make sure that I'm very very available
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.560]   to listeners and I'm I'm spending less time on email I'm spending less time on
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   show content and I'm really dedicated to spending as much of my time in that
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.160]   Facebook group as I can answering questions and the coolest thing is it's
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.840]   not just me there's a bunch of irregulars there's some very smart
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:39.920]   people very connected very experienced in very in many areas online business
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:45.880]   investing business you know traditional business and it's it's even and so far
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.600]   it's growing to be a pretty cool community and I think it's just gonna
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:52.040]   get better and better as time goes on so that's that's a big one and then I've
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.800]   got another man level there at $200 a month if you want to support the show at
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.360]   that level then I'll do an entire show on the topic of your choice you tell me
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.520]   the topic so if you want to get Joshua to just research a topic for you and you
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.120]   want to make sure it gets done support the show at $200 a month and then I will
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:12.040]   I'm gonna host a once a month essentially a mastermind call that's
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.720]   limited to four people but we'll host a once a month mastermind call with those
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.960]   four people and I will give you as much attention and focus as I can and so I'm
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.320]   gonna be reporting to you most importantly so that's in different
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.880]   levels that you can join at and every level matters again even a dollar a
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:32.960]   month it would be Matt what matters I've if at this point in time let me let me
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.920]   go through the campaigns let me tell you kind of how it works out as far as
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.960]   listenership of the show and the numbers I've also running a number of campaigns
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.760]   and these campaigns are goals under which I'll be reporting to you of
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.040]   certain amounts so for example the first goal is $2,000 a month if we can build
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:53.280]   the patron the patron campaign up to $2,000 per month at that point in time
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:58.400]   I'm going to commission a new intro for the show so those of you who hate the
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.220]   music then I'm gonna commission new intro for the show and those of you who
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.120]   love the music it'll still be around every now and then but it's maybe it'll
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.520]   be the outro music but it is a little it's a little much to do it both both
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.680]   sides of the show so that's the first thing is to get to that at $4,000 a
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.080]   month and you can see right on the patron patreon page let's go to radical
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:22.840]   personal finance comm slash patron and you can see it you can see it right
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.280]   there by the way both patron or patreon will work so radical personal finance
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:32.720]   comm slash patreon is the site patron is you you are the individual patron who's
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.360]   patronizing the show you're a patron of the arts so if you go to that you can
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.520]   see the number of at per month once I get it at $4,000 per month I will create
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:46.040]   a video course on the topic of your the audience choice and I will release that
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.720]   free instead of separate setting that up as a separate content for other people
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:55.640]   then I will release that directly to all of the patrons and that will be of as
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:01.480]   much value as I can possibly build and then the big one is ad free so the level
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:06.280]   of financial income that I need is for the show for this aspect of the show to
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.980]   keep the show ad free is about $6,000 per month and if we can get to $6,000
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.520]   per month I will commit to keeping the ad the show ad free that's the first
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:20.160]   that's the big push that I'm gonna be asking for you to push toward and
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:27.040]   support the show at is a $6,000 a month I can keep the show ad free and the I've
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.720]   got other ones as well so for example I really want to bring a producer onto the
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:33.240]   show someone to help me edit especially some of the interviews some of the
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:37.160]   interviews get very long and they could use some editing but again with that the
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   reason that they are long is I'm doing this with the number of hours that I
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:47.680]   have in a week and I just I don't have the time that I'm able to budget toward
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:53.000]   sitting down and going through the interview editing it carefully and you
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.880]   know making it more concise and I could certainly I could do fewer shows
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.720]   and release more and commit that time but I've received so much feedback from
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.760]   so many of you that you really are benefiting from the broad diverse show
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.640]   topics and so I want I feel like that's a better priority but after we get to
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:14.920]   the $6,000 per month I'll do a producer campaign I'll do other campaigns and the
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.360]   key with all of this is that everything you'll notice every one of the
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.960]   incentives is focused on the show and so what I've done is I've aligned my
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.400]   personal incentives to create a really great show for you and to serve you
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.680]   directly for listening to the show not for Joshua over here writing a book or
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.320]   not for Joshua over here creating a course it's all about the show and yes
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.800]   I'm I will still do those other things but now instead of having that internal
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:44.040]   conflict of should I do the show or should I focus on the serving you the
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:50.400]   patrons my direct incentive here is to serve you the patrons and so today I am
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.380]   launching this as a three-month campaign and a little over three months but the
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:50:00.040]   first initial phase of this campaign is until June 1st and I'm committing to
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:06.640]   keep the show ad free until June 1st and if we can get the if you if West if we
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:12.160]   together can build the show content excuse me skip build the patron
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.560]   contributions to $6,000 per month before June 1st I will continue to keep the
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:24.160]   show ad free this is the bad form to talk about your personal like things
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.480]   that's better form in sales to always talk about the needs of your audience
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:33.840]   but let me tell you why I'm choosing that so far I have funded I'm just I've
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.200]   invested in the business with my time and with my money out of my own savings
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.920]   and then done other work to support my family and again this is not a request
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.560]   for charity I'm coming up to the I was prepared to do that for one year from
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.840]   when I launched the show and I launched the show on July 1 and so I was prepared
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:58.840]   to do that for one year now at that point in time until one year but the
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.380]   other thing is my wife and I were expecting a baby girl this summer and so
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.360]   that's gonna be even more cut down on the amount of time that I have available
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:10.360]   and so I need the show to be financially viable for me to continue doing it at
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:16.240]   the rate that I'm doing it by that one year time point time horizon and so if I
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.600]   I know that I can make the $6,000 a month with the level of listenership and
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:26.520]   the ad and ads if I were to do that so but I really again for the reasons I've
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.680]   sketched out for your benefit I'm hoping to do this with this crowdfunding
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:35.280]   campaign instead of with ads so if we can do this about Jan June 1st to get to
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:40.800]   $6,000 a month I will keep the show ad free forever if we can't do it by June
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:46.240]   1st then I'll bring ads onto the show and then probably once we get it under
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:50.920]   $6,000 a month my plan would then be to scrap the ads so I'm hoping that you
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:56.080]   guys can can do it so at this point I just simply ask you to consider
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:00.320]   supporting the show and here's the key if every listener to the show pledged
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:06.200]   just two bucks a month that would be we're at $6,000 and I can keep the show
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:10.960]   ad free for you forever and then many of you hopefully will pledge at a much
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.440]   higher amount than that and then I can get some really cool stuff done I can
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:20.520]   get better interviews I can do things I mean I've there's so many things as you
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:24.280]   bootstrap a business and I hope you'll find this out as you bootstrap your own
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.480]   business or build your own business you've got to make sure that you're
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:34.080]   focusing on what the on what serves the odd on what serves your customers there
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.360]   are as an example there are a bunch of big-name people that I would love to
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:45.600]   interview I'd love to interview you know Markowitz and sharp and and and John
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:50.680]   Bogle Jack Bogle and and you know I'm here on the island I've got there
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.400]   hundreds of billionaires within a 15-minute drive for me and I'd love to
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:53:00.800]   interview each one of them the challenge is where to allocate your time and so
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:06.480]   once I get I can build a financial model underneath the show that's supporting
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:11.560]   that then I can really increase the the the level of content to a much higher
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:16.040]   level and I'm still regardless of whether regardless of it I'm committed
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.480]   to doing this thing at a world-class level so I still am doing those but for
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.720]   me to get on a plane and fly to Philadelphia and sit down with Jack
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:27.680]   Bogle for an hour or two I'd love to do that but it's got to be I've got to be
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:32.600]   able to support it and justify it to my bookkeeper which is me to my business
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.600]   coach which is me so if every listener to the show pledged two bucks a month
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.640]   we're at six thousand dollars I can keep the show ad free forever and then we can
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.680]   build into some really great some really great content so I would just simply ask
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:49.320]   you to consider to consider supporting the show and consider being my customer
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:57.360]   directly and I commit to you if you pledge to the show I commit to you to
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:02.840]   continue working as hard as I possibly can and I promise to keep bringing to
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:10.080]   you in-depth financial information that will help you to to reach your financial
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.400]   goals and I'll do it in a straightforward way I'll tell you what I
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:18.200]   think every single time I will explain why I think so what I do so that you can
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:25.080]   figure out if I'm right or if I'm wrong and I will and I'll bring you thousands
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:31.440]   of dollars of tips and advice and information that will help you I will
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:38.880]   bring you thousands of dollars worth of that in the in future shows and as your
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.240]   financial advisor I would tell you you know if you can invest ten bucks a month
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:48.000]   or 25 bucks a month or one dollar a month and get thousands of dollars per
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.080]   month of value that's a pretty good investment and I can't think of another
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:58.400]   investment that's gonna help you as much as that one I really can't that's my
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.200]   commitment is to produce that level of value it's a little bit slow going
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.360]   sometimes I've had a bit of a learning curve and learning it but that's my
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:12.280]   level of commitment to you as the promo that I played there at the beginning
