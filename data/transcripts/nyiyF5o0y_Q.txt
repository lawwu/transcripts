[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   How do we live fearlessly?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   That's how our week begins.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Happy Monday and thanks for joining us for another week on the podcast.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   The question today comes from a listener named David.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Here's his email.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   My question is about 1 Peter 3.15.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Various translations say things like this.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   "In your hearts, honor Christ the Lord as holy."
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   That's the ESV.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And pretty much the same as the Holman Christian Standard Bible,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   which calls us to honor Christ with our hearts.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   But the King James Version translates it, "Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts."
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   The New Living Translation says, "Worship Christ as Lord of your life."
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   The NIV says, "In your hearts, revere Christ as Lord."
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   So honor, sanctify, worship, revere.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   What does this Greek lemma, haiazo, mean?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And how would you apply it to our lives?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   This passage, 1 Peter 3.14-16, has a special place in my heart
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   because I can remember preaching on it my very first months
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   in the pastoral ministry at Bethlehem in 1980.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And the insight that I got then when I was preparing for that message,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I had never seen before.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And it was so significant to me that when I saw this question,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I said, "I want to do that.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I want to go back there and retell this story, retell this exegesis,"
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   because what I saw there, I've never forgotten.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It relates directly to David's question about how to translate verse 15,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   which in the ESV goes, "But in your hearts, honor Christ the Lord as holy."
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And David wants to know what that phrase means in this context and then in our lives.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   So let's put the text in front of us.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I'll start with verse, maybe in the middle of verse 14.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   "Even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake," even if you should,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   "you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   But in your hearts, honor Christ the Lord as holy,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   for a reason for the hope that is in you."
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So three kinds of observations bring clarity to the meaning of verse 15,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   the first part that David is asking about.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   "In your hearts, honor Christ the Lord as holy."
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And the first observation is the words themselves and how to translate them.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Here's the most literal rendering I can give.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   "The Lord Christ sanctify in your hearts."
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So, "Sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts."
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And the word "sanctify" is the word that's behind all these translations.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   "Worship Christ, revere Christ, honor Christ as holy."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And all of them are trying to avoid the word "sanctify" in English,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   probably, and probably wisely, because we usually think of "sanctify"
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   as overcoming sin and becoming more Christ-like, and that won't work.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   When we're talking about sanctifying God, this is an odd sound,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and so other words are chosen to try to make it more clear.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   But the word "sanctify" at root means set apart for some sacred purpose or consecrate.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And in God's case, it certainly involves revering and honoring and worshiping,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   recognizing His holiness, His transcendent purity,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   and feeling the beauty and greatness and preciousness of that holiness,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   that transcendent purity.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   So, all of these translations have elements of truth in them,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and I think "honor Christ as holy" comes as close as we can get to sanctifying Christ.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   That is, recognize God as supremely, transcendently pure and beautiful and valuable,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   and we're going to see, dreadful in a good way.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I'll come back to that in a minute.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Here's the second way we get clarity with this phrase in verse 15,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   "Honor Christ the Lord as holy."
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Let's see what's on either side of it, what comes just before in front
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   and what comes just after it behind.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So, just before these words, in front, are these words,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   "Have no fear of them," referring to persecutors.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   "Have no fear of them," then comes, "But honor the Lord Christ as holy."
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So, "Honor the Lord Christ as holy" is somehow an alternative to being afraid,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   having fear of those who persecute.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Then, behind the words, after them, in verse 16,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   after the words, "Honor the Lord Christ as holy," come these words,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   "Always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks a reason for the hope that is in you."
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So, it seems that in Peter's mind, the instruction to honor Christ the Lord as holy
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   would be a means to helping you be prepared to give a reason for the hope that is in you.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   So, in front of the words, he says, "Have no fear of your persecutors."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Behind the words, he says, "Be ready to tell why you are hopeful."
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And in between, he says, "Honor Christ the Lord as holy."
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So, now, let's hold on to that, and you'll see why that fearlessness in front
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and hopefulness in the back are significant.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   So, here's the third, and this was what, in 1980, was new to me.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I had never made these connections, and they've stuck with me ever since.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   The key that I had never seen before when I was reading this text was that it's a quotation from Isaiah 8, 12, and 13.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So, here's what Peter read in Isaiah that was so relevant to his situation that he adapted it in this context.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Here's what Isaiah 8, 12 says.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   "Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   In the Septuagint, in the Greek Old Testament, those last words are the exact words that Peter uses for not to be afraid or troubled by your persecutors.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   That's a direct quote there.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   In verse 13 in Isaiah 8, "But the Lord of hosts, him you shall honor as holy."
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Same word, hagiosate, in the Greek Old Testament, sanctify.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Sanctify the Lord, Yahweh, not Jesus, but Yahweh, which he's going to apply to Jesus.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Let him be your fear, let him be your dread, and he will become a sanctuary for you.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Now, Peter takes these words, "Do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread," and he quotes them in verse 14.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   "Have no fear of these vaunted persecutors around you."
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And then he sees that the solution that Isaiah gives to fearing man is a holy fear of God.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Honor the Lord as holy, let him be your fear, let him be your dread.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And in place of honoring the Lord Yahweh as holy, Peter says, "Honor the Lord Christ as holy."
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   This is what the New Testament writers do repeatedly.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Christ becomes the fulfillment, the incarnation of Yahweh, and what was true of Yahweh then is true of Christ now.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And by implication, let him be, let Christ be your fear, and let Christ be your dread as you regard him as holy.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Now, that may seem a very odd way to combat the fear of man, replace it with the fear of God.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   But the next phrase in Isaiah 8:14 just blew me away then, still does, it explains how this works.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   It says, "Let him be your fear, let him be your dread, and he will become a sanctuary."
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Amazing. That's amazing. God becomes a safe, hope-filled sanctuary from his own wrath, from our enemies, when he becomes our dread.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Now, how does that work? I think it works like this.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   When it becomes more fearful, more dreadful to us to dishonor God by trusting, by failing to trust his promises,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   when that's more dreadful to us than being persecuted by our enemies, then those very promises of God become a sanctuary for us.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   They become our hope.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So now the words, "In your hearts, honor Christ the Lord as holy," include the meaning, "Let him be your fear, let him be your dread, not your persecutors,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   and he will become your sanctuary, your solid place of hope."
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   So both the words "in front" then, of verse 15, and "afterwards," behind, get their meaning from the meat in the middle of the sandwich.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   The bread on top, the words "in front," say, "Don't be afraid of your persecutors," and the meat in the middle explains,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   "Because when you honor Christ as holy," that is, when you dread distrusting Christ more than you dread your enemies,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   "he will be a hope-filled sanctuary for you, and you don't need to be afraid."
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And then the bread, the slice of bread that's on the bottom of the sandwich, the words "following," that say,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   "Always be ready to give a reason for your hope," is explained again by the meat in the middle of the sandwich.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   When we honor Christ as holy, when we dread distrusting him more than we dread our adversaries,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   he is a reason for our hope that we can give to anybody.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I've never forgotten, Tony, I've never forgotten that key from Isaiah 8, 12, "Don't let men be your dread, let God be your dread,"
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   which at first sounds, "Well, that's not a happy solution."
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Oh, but it is. Dreading, distrusting God. Dreading, distrusting God turns into a sanctuary.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   He becomes a sanctuary. He will become your reason for hope, and he will become the ground of your fearlessness before your adversaries.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Amazing. And of course, we have access to that very sermon from October 19, 1980, preached by 34-year-old John Piper, 42 years ago.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I'll pull a clip from it, and as we ask the question, "What's the big deal with fearing man anyways?"
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   That's next time. We'll revisit that sermon. Thank you for joining us today.
