[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   There are two statements in the English language which are common to all of us.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.660]   I've said them, you've said them, people all around us on a daily basis use these two statements.
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.280]   But I believe that if you really want to make progress in your life, you need to recognize
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.920]   how damaging these two statements are and eradicate them from your life.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.280]   I challenge you to eliminate these two phrases from your vocabulary.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.880]   Phrase number one, "I don't have time."
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.280]   Phrase number two, "I can't afford that."
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.060]   Time and money are alternate forms of currency.
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.520]   We use time to make money, most of us, and then we use money to buy time.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.940]   So they're closely related.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.640]   The more impactful of these, by the way, I believe is not the basis of money, but rather
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.740]   the factor of time.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:11.060]   One of the most damaging phrases that you can use in your life is, "I don't have time."
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.860]   Two reasons why you should eliminate this phrase and also the phrase, "I can't afford
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.860]   that."
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.640]   Number one, these two phrases are simply not true.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.440]   They're never true.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.660]   Now obviously that's a big statement.
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.320]   Do you doubt me?
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.740]   First, you can't actually have time.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.280]   Time is not something that you possess.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.580]   Time is an experience that you have.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.060]   It's a bit of a mystery.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.580]   The philosophers work to pull it apart and try to understand it.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.880]   It's one of those things that we experience and you know exactly what time is until you
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.500]   sit down with a pen and paper and try to actually write out a definition of time.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.060]   But you don't have more or less time than anybody else.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:06.320]   You have the same 168 hours in your week that I do in my week.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.040]   You have the same 24 hours in your day that I do in my day.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.300]   And we have the same amount of time as every other person in the world.
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.320]   So you can't have time.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.620]   You can only use the time you have.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.580]   Now you say, "Obviously I know that.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.580]   That's not what I meant, Joshua.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.100]   I meant I don't have time, meaning I've got too many important things to do so therefore
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.460]   I can't do whatever it is that I don't want to do."
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:47.220]   Well here I point out to you that you actually don't have anything that's more important
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.720]   than what you're doing unless you decide to give it more importance.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.660]   No matter the urgent task that's on your plate today, no matter the urgent project or priority,
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:09.820]   the pressing deadline, no matter the task, project, or deadline, it is negotiable if
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.220]   the stakes were high enough.
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.840]   If you got a phone call right now that your son or daughter was in the hospital and had
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.140]   been in a serious car accident and might live only out the hour, you'd be in the car headed
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.780]   to the hospital as quickly as you could be.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:35.940]   No matter who you are, it's all a matter of priorities and not a matter of time.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.660]   You always have enough time to do the things that are the most important to you.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.320]   One of my favorite maxims of life is, "There's never enough time to do everything, but there's
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.660]   always enough time to do the most important things."
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.060]   So the statement, "I don't have time," is not true.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.700]   What about, "I can't afford that"?
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.500]   Well, this one isn't as clear as, "I don't have time," but I think it's also...
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   We can also apply those same two arguments to it.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.580]   This is going to sound very metaphysical, but it's not true.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.620]   The phrase, "I can't afford that," is actually a phrase that has very little meaning.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.780]   First, who says what you can and can't afford?
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.320]   You're the one who has control of your budget.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.660]   You don't run your budget based upon an article in Money Magazine or a percentage of advice
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.040]   that Joshua Sheets gives on radical personal finance.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.220]   You choose what to spend your money on, and you're always going to spend money on the
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.300]   things that you value, on the things that are the most important to you.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.500]   It's also not true because money is literally unlimited.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.340]   Money is created, and there are always ways to go and get more money.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.140]   If the idea is good enough, if the need is grand enough, if the project is compelling
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.620]   enough, the money can flow in.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.660]   So the phrase, "I can't afford that," it really doesn't have a lot of meaning to it.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.500]   Now of course, as with time, I understand what you mean when you say, "I don't have
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.900]   time," and I understand what you mean when you say, "I can't afford that."
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.780]   But the meaning that you think is there is actually not there.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.940]   These statements have a lot less meaning when you sit down and examine them.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.620]   But the big reason why I think you should reject these statements is they're simply
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.780]   not useful.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.740]   They're not true, and they're not useful to you.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.260]   The reason they're not useful is they don't need to action.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.380]   Saying, "I don't have time," is a negative statement, and your mind immediately stops.
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:05.580]   Well, I can reject this opportunity because, well, I don't have time.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.540]   You won't go beyond that.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:16.660]   If you say, "I can't afford it," you'll probably just quit, and you won't go beyond that.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.180]   These ending negative statements are not useful because they don't lead to a solution.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.740]   And if you've got a problem, you should lead with a solution.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:34.020]   And the way you do that is you ask a question, or you at least start with an honest statement.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.500]   So I urge you to banish these two phrases from your life because they're not true, and
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.140]   they're not useful.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:49.020]   And I urge you to supplement and utilize some truthful, useful statements instead.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.260]   Here are some ideas to get your brain working, but of course, you'll have to come up with
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.460]   the ones that are appropriate to your situation.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:04.660]   Instead of saying, "I don't have time," try an honest, truthful statement like, "I don't
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:11.220]   want to make time for that activity right now."
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.820]   Instead of saying, "I don't have time," say, "What you're proposing is not important enough
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:23.300]   for me at the moment to dedicate the time to it."
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.140]   Instead of saying, "I don't have time," say, "I have other priorities in my life right
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.480]   now that are more important to me, and so I'm choosing to spend time on those other
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.420]   things instead of what you're proposing."
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:45.180]   Or just, if you need to give a flat-out no, just simply say, "What you're proposing is
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:52.340]   not important enough for me to dedicate any of my precious time toward it."
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:58.500]   You don't have to be completely abrupt and brusque with your statements to annoy people
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.960]   and offend people in order to be honest.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:09.140]   You can find an honest, truthful statement that would indicate the reality, which is,
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:17.080]   it's not important enough for you to use some of your time in that manner.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:23.280]   Instead of saying, "I can't afford that," say, "I don't have the money to pay for that
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.780]   right now."
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:32.720]   Very small difference, but even just that slight difference, still a statement, not
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:39.040]   as powerful as a question, but even that slight difference is much more empowering.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.600]   Saying "I don't have the money to pay for that right now" points out the problem, which
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:51.440]   is lack of money, not "I can't afford that," which is some kind of weird vice thing that
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.800]   jumps on you and that you're pretending I don't have control over this.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.640]   If what you mean by "I can't afford that" is it's not allocated in the budget, say that.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.140]   Say, "I haven't budgeted the money for that right now," or "I haven't allocated the money
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.560]   for that right now."
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.600]   You'll find that as your wealth grows, you'll need to say that more and more because you
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.560]   can't truthfully say, "I can't afford that."
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.360]   You can't truthfully even say, "I don't have the money for that," and you have to truthfully
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.540]   say, "I haven't allocated the money for that right now," or "I haven't decided to budget
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.640]   the money for that right now."
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.720]   Now, maybe you don't have the money.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.080]   That's okay.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.980]   A more truthful statement would be something like this.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.200]   It's not important enough for me to figure out a way to come up with the money for that
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   right now.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.560]   Again, doubt me.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.100]   I'll pick on your kids again.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:54.000]   Your kid has a terminal illness, but there's a cure available.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:03.400]   I could put any dollar amount on that cure, and you would figure out a way to come up
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:12.720]   with the money.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.440]   Where there's a will, there's a way.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:28.800]   When people have a pressing, urgent need that they need help with, people tend to be resourceful.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.240]   A statement like, "It's not important enough for me to figure out a way to come up with
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.520]   the money for that right now," is a good statement, or "I haven't figured out how to pay for that
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:47.520]   yet," or "I don't know what to do to earn the money for that at the moment."
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.280]   These are much more accurate statements, but they're still statements, so here's how you
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.680]   turn them into questions.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.380]   A question would be, instead of saying, "I don't have time," say, "That's not a priority
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.360]   for me right now," and ask yourself, "Should it be?
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.040]   Is that a priority for me right now?"
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:14.400]   If you find that in answer to that question, it should be a priority or it is a priority,
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:23.880]   then you ask yourself this, "How can I make time for that right now?"
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.420]   You see this all over the place.
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.280]   People ignore their family until their life is falling apart, and then all of a sudden,
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.640]   they start making time to spend with those they love.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.360]   They ignore their brother until all of a sudden, their brother is diagnosed with a terminal
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.100]   illness, and then all of a sudden, they start making the phone calls.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.080]   People have a tendency to ignore their health until they're diagnosed with heart disease,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.720]   and the doctor says, "You must solve this problem or you will die," and then all of
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.440]   a sudden, they're the most committed, healthy people that you find.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.120]   Guess what?
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.280]   You can control that.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.840]   So ask yourself a question, "How can I make time for this activity?
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.820]   If this is important to me, how can I make time for this activity?"
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:19.140]   Because a question like that leads to your thinking about it in the proper light.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.800]   You're being honest with yourself.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.720]   You might say, "I can't have time," and you might really mean it, and it might actually
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:35.380]   be true in the sense that your schedule is so packed that there's no calendar space available
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:41.260]   for you to insert this activity.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.800]   So if you ask yourself the question, "How can I make time?"
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.480]   It empowers you to make a change that leads to the result that you want.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.680]   Remember, you got to pay the price before you get the reward.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.240]   You've got to plant before you reap.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.620]   You got to perform the action that leads to the result.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.760]   With your money, ask yourself, "Is there a way that I could afford this?
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.160]   Is there a way that I could come up with the money for this?
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.620]   Is there a way that I could earn the money for this?"
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:22.840]   From little numbers to big numbers, the young man, about an 11-year-old boy in my neighborhood
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.720]   here who washes my car, he came to me this last week.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.240]   Man, you got to admire his gutsiness.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.880]   Comes to me and usually charges me 10 bucks to do my car wash, which is a little bit of
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.640]   an overprice, but I'm happy to pay it because it's supporting my local entrepreneur and
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.640]   it gives me a chance to talk to him and to encourage him.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.520]   But he came to me and he said to me, "Hey, listen.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.860]   Today, would you mind, I'd like to charge you $12 instead of $10 because there's this
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.600]   sweater that I want down at the store and I'd really like to buy it and I need $12 for
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   it."
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.200]   Now, I had a little lesson with him about providing value for the customer instead of
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.320]   just asking, but at the end of the day, he walked away with his $12 in his pocket to
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.880]   buy his sweater that he wanted and I wasn't unhappy to pay it.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.860]   I admired his gutsiness and his clarity.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.760]   His gutsiness and his clarity was, "I want this thing.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.040]   How can I earn the money to get it?"
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.400]   You and I could take a lesson from that.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:29.240]   Almost any number that you have, if there's a goal that you have, a financial goal, whether
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:35.920]   that's a personal consumption goal for yourself or whether that is a goal for an impact or
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:42.000]   something you're trying to fund in the world, almost any number, you can put together a
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.280]   plan that would earn it.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.720]   If it were important enough to you, you'd do it.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:59.880]   Honest, precise language is the starting point of great change.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.040]   Seek the truth, start with yourself, and then start to others.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:17.960]   In our world today, truth is becoming and has become a much, much debated topic.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   It seems as though people place less and less importance on truth.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.400]   Don't let that bother you.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.000]   Truth matters today more than ever.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.280]   As the one of my favorite quote from me from George Orwell in 1984, "Being in a minority,
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.700]   even in a minority of one, did not make you mad.
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.560]   There was truth and there was untruth.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:54.820]   And if you clung to the truth, even against the whole world, you were not mad."
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.080]   Start with speaking truthfully to yourself.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:06.880]   I challenge you, be precise in your language to yourself.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.760]   Make a 30-day challenge to banish the use of these two phrases from your vocabulary.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.240]   Do not say, "I don't have time."
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.200]   And do not say, "I can't afford that."
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:26.600]   Say something that's more truthful, and if what you're talking about is a priority, ask
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:33.200]   yourself a question of how you can achieve the outcome that you're trying to achieve.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:42.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
