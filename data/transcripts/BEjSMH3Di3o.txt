[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   big questions emerged this week as Bloomberg reported that Apple
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.200]   was speaking to both Google and open AI about powering certain
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.920]   AI features on iOS specifically, according to the article, this
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.880]   deal between Apple and Google seems much more likely than the
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.440]   open AI one and could happen this year.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.600]   This is the most consequential new development in technology
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.760]   and compute in probably 20 years, 30 years, and to not have
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.720]   enough allocated to this so that you have a legitimate path
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.840]   forward to do it yourself, I think is a little inexcusable
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.200]   actually, who would look at the launch of Google Gemini and say,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.960]   I want that that launch was a total fiasco. Another woke
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960]   company. I think it fits the Apple philosophy pretty well.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.280]   How woke would Tim Cook have to be to look at the launch of
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   Gemini and say, Oh, yeah, I don't see anything wrong there.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.640]   You got that. I want that. Yeah, apparently Tim Cook is the only
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.840]   person on earth who's impressed with the launch of Google
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.960]   Gemini. I mean, I can't believe the story is true. It can't be
