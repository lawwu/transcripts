[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:58.620]   Asset. Now an obvious example of an asset could be money. Money that you have in your wallet, money that you have in a bank account, money that you have in an investment fund of some kind. That can be an asset. But that asset of money could be diversified. For example, you might consider your business to be an asset because your business prints money for you. It creates money. Your career is an asset.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:28.540]   Because that career allows you to create money. You create it through your physical work. So now the idea of the term asset could be more inclusive. For example, your reputation could be an asset. If your reputation is slandered, that could seriously affect your earning ability. If your reputation is built on honesty and integrity, and you lose that reputation,
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:28.540]   that could seriously affect your earning ability. If your reputation is built on honesty and integrity, and you lose that reputation,
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:28.540]   if your reputation is built on honesty and integrity, and you lose that reputation,
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:28.540]   If your reputation is slandered, that could seriously affect your earning ability. If your reputation is built on honesty and integrity, and you lose that reputation,
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:28.540]   If your reputation is slandered, that could seriously affect your earning ability. If your reputation is built on honesty and integrity, and you lose that reputation,
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:28.540]   If your reputation is built on honesty and integrity, and you lose that reputation,
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:58.560]  ,
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:58.560]   If your reputation is built upon your competence, you might lose income. So your reputation, your good name, your good standing, your character can be an asset. You may be the kind of person who is known for having a strong and upright moral character. If so, you'll find that people will stick up for you. They'll defend you. That's an asset that's worth defending. If you're a strong moral character, you'll find that people will stick up for you. They'll defend you. That's an asset that's worth defending.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:28.580]   The house that you live in can be an asset. The car that you drive can be an asset. The gun that you carry can be an asset. The cabin that you escape to for vacation can be an asset. The surfboard that you own that provides you with a form of entertainment can be an asset. All of these things, being a mixture of real property and personal property, the assets that you live in can be an asset.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:58.600]  ,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   and you can be a part of the family that you live in.

[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.220]   Let me give you a simple, absolutely legally true example as to how this is so important.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.620]   Let's say that you are accustomed to dealing in cash.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.200]   And because you like to get good deals on your vehicles,
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.740]   you're on your way to go and buy a $10,000 or $15,000 minivan,

But I'll give you as much as I've got. But don't get overwhelmed in the details such that you procrastinate.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.440]   Because as with most good financial planning, the people who are able to protect their assets are the ones who take action now. Doesn't do you any good to close the barn door after the horse has escaped. You close the barn door when you put the horse in it. So from now going forward, think defensively. Be paranoid. Think what could happen. And how can I protect myself from this risk? Because the time to do good asset
