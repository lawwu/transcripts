[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Welcome again to Bogul Heads-On Investing
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Podcast #15.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   This podcast, like all podcasts,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogul
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Center for Financial Literacy,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   In this episode of Bogul Heads-On Investing,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I am happy to have with us
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Eric Balchunas, the Senior ETF Analyst
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   at Bloomberg Intelligence.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I've known Eric for many years,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   since he started doing this research.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   He is also now on the air
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   at Bloomberg Radio and TV,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   a weekly television show,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   where he discusses different ETFs
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and the way investors can utilize them.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   He has a book,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   The Institutional ETF Toolbox,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   published by Wiley.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   So with no further ado,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   let me bring in Eric Balchunas.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Welcome, Eric.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Great to be here, Rick.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I'm so glad to have you on the show.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I get so many questions
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   about exchange-traded funds
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   versus mutual funds.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   What should I buy?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Should I buy an ETF?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Should I buy a mutual fund?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And I'm hopefully going to be able to answer
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   a lot of those questions today.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   But let's start out with you.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   How did you get involved in the ETF business?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Yeah, good question.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I was an economics major
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and a journalism major.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   So I did a couple of things out of college.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   One was I worked at Institutional Investor,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   the magazine.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I was in the newsletter division.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I first covered derivatives,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   but then I got moved over to covering funds
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   at a newsletter called Fund Action,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   which is still around today, actually.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Ironically, now they'll call me to get a quote,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   so come full circle.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So I wrote for them.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   When was that?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   When did you start?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Mid to late '90s.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I remember the Vanguard PR guy, John Wirth,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   he actually sent me recently an email.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I wrote him in like '97,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   asking him for information on some Vanguard fund,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   which I didn't recall.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   But at the time, the big companies
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   were T. Rowe Price, Fidelity.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Like Vanguard was a little more down the list.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Indexing was still a minor player
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   in the funds business,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   but I certainly remember covering them a little bit.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   So then I went off, worked at,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   did some third-party marketing,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   a couple of different jobs.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   But I found a job at Bloomberg in year 2000,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   and I instantly loved it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So I was working in the public relations department
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   for about two years,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   but then right around 9/11,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   a few months after that,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I moved back out of Manhattan to South Jersey,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and I didn't want to make that commute to New York.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So I transferred to the data office,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   and I took a job there.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And the closest thing that would be applicable for me
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   was fund data.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So I worked in the data,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   at the funds data area of Bloomberg for 14 years.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And right in the middle of that time,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I got assigned to ETFs in about 2006.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I immediately saw they were going to be a big deal.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And, you know, after you talk to some people,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   go to a conference or two,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   you're like, yeah, this is actually,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   this product makes a lot of sense.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And you sort of see that
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   if you know mutual funds and close-end funds,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   you sort of see the ETFs
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   as taking a few evolutionary steps forward at once,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   not just one little step, but a few.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And so I just sort of made myself
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   the expert on ETFs around that time,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   started going to conferences,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and at the same time,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   building out the DEF page for ETFs
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   to make them more ETF-ish,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   add fields like index rating methodology and so forth.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So I was like the ETF data guy for many years.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And then I started writing a little bit
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   because I had that background.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And the research group just took a notice
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   in some of the posts I would do for our website
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   and asked me to join research
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and head up the ETF research for Bloomberg Intelligence,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   which is the research wing of Bloomberg.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And I've been doing that for about three years now
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   and manage a team of four people
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   who now write ETF research,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   although we'll do mutual funds a little bit,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   we'll do hedge funds even,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and we'll work in some of the global scene as well.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But largely we stick to US ETFs.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   - And you also do a television program once a week.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   - Yeah, so when I was trying to become the ETF guy
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   within Bloomberg in the late 2010, 2012, 2014,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   like around that time,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I felt there was vacuums in ETF coverage
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   all over the company,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   whether it's sales, television, radio.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And so I just sort of tried to forge through
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and make myself available
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and started doing a couple of hits here and there
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   for television.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Found myself a weekly segment on Friday at 4.30 PM,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   which is like three in the morning
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   for financial television,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   but still I was beggars can't be choosers.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   But that was a segment that got me some reps.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Yeah, then a TV show formed,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   it's called ETF IQ,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   it's about two years old.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's with Scarlett Fu
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and I'm sort of,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I come on and give color commentary,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   play a good hand in sort of getting some of the guests
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   and writing the script each week.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And then I have a podcast called Trillions
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   that formed about two years ago.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So I think ETFs kind of went mainstream
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   inside Bloomberg for sure,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and in the general market about three or four years ago.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So I think the show and podcast
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and a lot of the great news coverage
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   you see out of Bloomberg
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   is all part of the sort of mainstreaming of ETFs,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   even at a big company like Bloomberg,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   although they were covered heavily for a long time
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   in the trade publications, obviously.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Like I just looked today,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Financial Times and Wall Street Journal
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   both had multiple ETF articles out.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I guess every month or so
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   they put out like a special report.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   So they've definitely gone mainstream.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And I think the show and the podcast
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   are just a sort of symbolic of that,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   how big they've gotten.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   - And there's a few things
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   that have occurred here in the last year
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   that is going to even cause that to accelerate,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   which we'll get to in a few minutes.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   But before then,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I want to sort of walk down a memory lane
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   and go back to the beginning.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And I know you did a couple of shows on this
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   where you researched the beginning of ETFs
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   and why they were created
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and who was involved
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and talk about why these products
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   even came into existence
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   and what they were originally for
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and how they've changed and evolved over the years.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   - You know, it really goes back
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   to the '87 crash Black Monday.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   That was a monster event.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   There still has not been
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   a percentage decline day in the market
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   that has even come close to that.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   What happened was the SEC went
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   and wrote a postmortem on what happened.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And in that report,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   you know, they sort of,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   there's a lot of things going on,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   but it was portfolio insurance
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   which used futures contracts.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And that was the key.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I think they thought
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   that there was a downward spiral created
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   between stocks and futures.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And the futures were not managed by the SEC.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And I, in that report,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   SEC kind of hinted that
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   if there was something like a futures contract
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   that were like under our supervision,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   that was like basket trading
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   could be done on the exchange,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   this big event might not have happened
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   because the futures market
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   had different rules and regulations.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And they thought some of that
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   kind of contaminated the stock market in New York.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And that was part of, I believe,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   the motive for writing that report
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   and sort of suggesting that
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   if people wanted to do basket trading and hedge
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   and there might be a better way to do it.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   So this report was read
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   by Nate Most and Steve Bloom
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   who were at the American Stock Exchange.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Now, Amex was in third place in trading.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   So they were hungry
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   to try to find a new product
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   that would increase volume.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   And so when they read this report,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   they sort of took this little sketch
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   of a basket trading product
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   and ran with it.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And they sort of kicked around a few ideas
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   and this is where the story gets interesting
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   for Bogleheads.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Nate Most had this idea
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   to have the Vanguard 500 be traded on an exchange.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And that would be this new ETF idea.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   He goes to Bogle's office
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   and Bogle basically says,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   "No way on hell would I ever do anything like this
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   to my precious Vanguard 500.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I'm anti-trading, yada, yada."
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   But Bogle, and when I interviewed him about this,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   said Nate Most was a great guy.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   You know, we remained friends
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   and Bogle says he gave Nate Most
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   three problems with the product
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   that would help separate the trading
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and the cost inside the fund.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And Bogle said, "No, thank you,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   but here's some suggestions."
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   So Nate Most went
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and reworked the product at that point.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And I think a key part
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   to what made the product work so well
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   was in order to separate the trading
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   that goes on an ETF every day
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   from the long-term investors
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   'cause they don't wanna incur the cost of the trading.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   That's part of the problem with the mutual fund
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   is the trading costs.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   What they did was Nate Most used his background
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   of working at a commodities warehouse.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   He ran the Pacific Commodities Exchange
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   for a number of years.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And in a commodities warehouse,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   instead of trading soybean oil back and forth
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   and moving a lot of product around,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   you store the soybean oil in this warehouse
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   and you get a receipt.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And then you can just trade the receipt with people.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And if you get enough receipts
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   where you actually want your soybeans,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   you just go to the warehouse, give them all the receipts.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   They get you the soybean oil back in your possession.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And vice versa,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   if you're sitting on a lot of soybean oil
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   and you'd rather not,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   you can go into the warehouse,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   get the receipts and then sell those.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And he just took that concept
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   and applied it to the 500 stocks in the S&P.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   So that's where the word spider actually comes from,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   S&P Depository Receipt.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   So try to tell people ETFs are like a receipt
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   to the 500 stocks sitting in a warehouse,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   except instead of a warehouse, it's a custodian.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   So that concept is where Nate Most
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   really took that SEC sketch
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   and took it to the next level,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   added in Bogle's suggestions.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   And what they did is they submitted to the SEC this idea,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   which is the ETF.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And it sat there for four years.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   The SEC had a lot of internal back and forth and issues,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   but the weight was worth it
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   because a lot of other types of derivative products
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   that were based on indexes were coming out,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   but nothing had the sort of fiduciary
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   long-term ability as SPY.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   So when SPY came out,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   what made it I think so powerful for many
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   is that a lot of people could see
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   the long-term investor potential for it,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   not just the trading aspect,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   but of course, Amex really designed it
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   to increase trading on the exchange
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and it definitely worked.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   That thing traded, although it took a couple of years,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   it wasn't like a hit right off the bat.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   The '90s market helped,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   got some true believers,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   had a couple of big investors early on.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   People liked to use it to hedge options on it,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   help people.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   So it took a little while,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   but towards the late '90s,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   the assets and the volume started to double.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   - I was in the brokerage industry at the time in the 1990s
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and I had had my epiphany about index funds
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   and I was really limited to what I could use.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I was over at Smith Barney and active management
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   was just not doing well relative to markets.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And, you know, SPDRs had come along
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   and then I think it was '96 MIDIs,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   which are the mid-cap, S&P 400 mid-cap came along.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And I was able to swap out actively managed funds
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   and individual managed accounts of equities
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   for SPDRs and MIDIs.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And they weren't ETFs at the time.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   The acronym ETF didn't exist.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   They were SPDRs.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   That's what they were called.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So I began using these ETFs as a broker
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and I had to be one of the first brokers
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   to actually use them in retail accounts,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   but I thought they were great and they were very low cost.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   So since the popularity of SPDR,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   which was a State Street product,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Vanguard also came out with a S&P ETF, VOO,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and iShare has an S&P product, IVV,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   and they're both lower cost versus SPY.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   SPY has higher fees and yet it's so much bigger
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   and has more volume.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And so why would money flow into the higher cost S&P product
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   when there are lower cost S&P products available?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Well, liquidity.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It's got what I call oceanic liquidity.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   And if you look at the investors in SPY,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   there are some big giant fish using this thing.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Everybody from Bridgewater, right?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   That's the world's biggest hedge fund.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   You've got Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   There's pensions in there, there's endowments.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   So a lot of people like the liquidity
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   and a lot of people use SPY as a liquidity sleeve.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Like if they're active or doing something else,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   SPY could be something that they just use
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   to tweak up or down their beta exposure
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   or their equity exposure on their portfolio.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   This might not be their core equity exposure.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   I think also that SPY's assets have been hurt by the fee
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   because if you look at SPY over the last three years,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   it's I think seen a little bit of outflows
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   or it's at least flat.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   All the new money is going to the net new flows
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   are going to IVV and VOOC.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   But what's interesting is we study volume market share
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   and asset market share for ETFs.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And what's fascinating is while SPY's asset market share
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   has been going down pretty steadily for a number of years,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   it's volume market share is almost unmoved.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I think it still is about 95% of all the volume
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   in the S&P 500 ETFs.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   And this is where we come to our conclusion,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   which is that in the sea war,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   it's much easier to steal land than sea.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Vanguard has an amazing army.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   They're going to steal your land because they're cheaper.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   The assets can be moved pretty easily.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   But when it comes to liquidity,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   it's a lot harder to peel off people who seek liquidity
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   like institutions and traders.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And so SPY, MDY, the ones we mentioned earlier,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   they're going to be around and big for a long time
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   because it will be quite a while before IVV
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   hits that tipping point where it becomes actually more liquid.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Could be 10 years from now.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   We used to think it would happen quicker
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   and that those older, more liquid ones
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   that cost more would just go away.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   But it could take a long, long time for that to happen.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   It probably will at some point,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   but SPY at this point is sort of like a sun
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and there's a whole solar system connected to it.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   The options on SPY have a volume
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   that is about half of all equities.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   It's enormous.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   And that takes a long time to eat into.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   - So Eric, where could I find more information
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   about the history of ETFs?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   - If you go to Google and you type in the ETF story,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   you will find a site called the ETF story.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And me and my podcast colleague, Joel Weber,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   did a Ken Burns style audio documentary,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   a six part series on the history of ETF.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Starts on Black Monday and goes right through
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   to the invention of smart beta basically.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And it really is fascinating.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   We interview people who were there
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   and Vogel is also in the interview,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   that part about him being involved.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   He talks about the ETF and it's just fascinating.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   So if anybody finds this somewhat interesting,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   you will love this documentary.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   I highly recommend it.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   - Let's get into the whole concept
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   of how these things work
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   and really why they could be a better mousetrap.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   They certainly are from a tax perspective
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   for taxable clients.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   How do I know when I put my order in
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   that I'm gonna get a decent price?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   These funds also have an iNav
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   that shows what the value was up to 15 seconds ago.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   You know, but still, I mean,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   the market moves faster than that.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   So let's get into the whole mechanics
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   of how ETFs got created,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   how they're redeemed, how they're traded.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Start out with the creation.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   I mean, how do you get an ETF into the marketplace?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   - So if you think about a creation,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   go back to that commodities warehouse receipt, right?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Where in order to create new shares of an ETF,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   an authorized participant, which is, you know,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   really just a gigantic bank
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   that is hooked up to the whole system.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   In fact, when Spyder was being designed,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   when the original ETF was being designed,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   here's a quote from Kathleen Moriarty,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   who was a lawyer working on it at the time.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   "In order to create all 500 stocks,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   "you'd have a portfolio basket
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   "that was worth about 1 million.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   "The average person was never gonna come in
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   "and out for a million,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   "so we need to deal with companies
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   "who were dealing with the DTC and the NSCC."
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   So people who were broker-dealers,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   it had to be somebody hooked up to the system.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   So that's why it's like a Goldman or a Credit Suisse.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   These are the APs,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   and each ETF is assigned a couple APs
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   who do this creation redemption.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And so they'll take the 500 stocks in the S&P,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   go to that proverbial warehouse,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   hand it in in a certain size,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   and get shares of the ETF or receipts.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Those receipts then trade on the open market.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   So if there's a lot of demand for a product,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   let's say the solar energy ETF,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   it has a good month and everybody starts to want it,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   the demand on the exchange will start to get so high
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   that market makers and the AP will say,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   "Hey, why don't we arbitrage this?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   "We'll put new shares on the market
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   "and sell the stocks and pocket the difference."
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   And that arbitrage is really what creates
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   creations of redemptions in a normal market.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   So the fact that you can take the underlying basket,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   hand it in, is really wonderful
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   because it does utilize arbitrage.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And arbitrage is a nasty sounding word,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   but it's actually very useful in this case
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   because arbitrage is what keeps the price of the ETF
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   very, very close to the net asset value,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   which is what the portfolio is worth.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   In my book, I call that the flux capacitor.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   In "Back to the Future," that's how time travel works.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   The creation redemption process is ETF's flux capacitor.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   That's the brilliant part of it that really makes it work
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   and survive and work well in nasty days,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   up days, down sideways days.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   It makes it very robust.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   - The way it works for an individual investor
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   when they put their order in to buy 100 shares of VTI,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   they're going to the exchange.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   They're getting their 100 shares from somebody else.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   They're not getting it from the fund company.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   - Yes.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Yes, so if somebody puts in...
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   - No, and then they...
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   So it's an exchange between two people
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   as opposed to opened-end mutual funds
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   where you would go to Vanguard directly
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   and buy the Total Stock Market Mutual Fund
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   directly from Vanguard with cash.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Here, you're going to the exchange with the same cash,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   and you're buying somebody else's shares
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   that is trading them on the exchange.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   - Correct, and I think that's an important difference.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Most people who are buying their ETF
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   are probably just going to buy it
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   from somebody else who's selling that day,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   just like a stock.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   About 90% of ETF volume is that.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   10%, give or take the asset class,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   will be creation/redemption activity
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   where there's just a bigger order
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   that there's not enough shares on the exchange,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   so somebody has to go and do a creation
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   to satisfy that big order,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   or there's just a frenzy of excitement for an area,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   and they need more supply.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   So that market maker will then go ahead
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   and make creations in order to feed that demand.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   But again, that's only a small portion of the time.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Most of the time, the market just is buyers and sellers
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   going back and forth like stocks.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   - Now, there's a lot of benefits
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   to an individual investor for using ETF.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   There's some drawbacks,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   but there's some benefits as well.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   I'll hit a couple of drawbacks first.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   So when you go to the exchange
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   and you're going to buy or sell something,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   you really don't know what the price is.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   You can look on your computer screen,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   but the information we get as an investor
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   trading down here in Texas
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   using my app on my custodian
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   is light years behind
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   what is actually going on in the marketplace.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   So I put my order in to buy.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   I really don't know what I'm going to get,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   but I try to put in a limit order of some sort
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   so I don't overpay,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   but again, I don't know what the price should be.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And I put the order in, and I get an execution,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   but I don't know whether or not that's good or bad.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   So that's kind of a disadvantage.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I'm in the dark trading,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   whereas if I was going to go directly to say Vanguard,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   and there are other companies out there,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Schwab and so forth,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   but I'm just using Vanguard as an example.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   If I was going to go to Vanguard directly
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   and buy their open-end fund,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   I know I'm going to get NAV at the end of the day.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   No question.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   So how close really is my trade
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   as a retail small investor doing ETF trading,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   how close am I to actually getting NAV
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   on a big fund like VTI?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   It's going to be very close.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   VTI, I mean, I have a chart here,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   and I'm pulling up of the percent premiums.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I mean, if you look at it on any given day,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   it's one basis point, one basis point,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   two basis points.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   So we're talking two basis points,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   and let's just say the bid-ask spread is another BIP.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And by the way,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   sometimes you could actually pay a little less than the NAV
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   if you're lucky,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   so it doesn't always work against you,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   but let's just assume
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   you're going to pay two BIPs of a premium.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Worst case scenario,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   you could put a market order in,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   maybe three, right?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   You add a BIP to that, there's four.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   So yeah, that's a real extra cost.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   How much is a BIP?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   If I'm investing $10,000, what's a BIP?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   $10,000, that'd be a dollar.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Well, it's not like $100 or anything like that.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   No, no.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   I mean, so VTI, let's see.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Here's how, in fact,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   this is a great excuse to do a total cost of VTI.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   VTI charges you three BIPs,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   so that'd be $3 on an annual fee.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Let's say the premium,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   let's say there's two there,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   and your spread is one,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   so there's three, that's six.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   The good news is Vanguard will do
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   a little securities lending in this thing.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   And if I look over the past year,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   it's put in two basis points
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   worth of securities lending revenue,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   so that takes two away.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   So you're looking at maybe four,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   four BIPs.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   But again, you have to remember that
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   the trading costs that we just mentioned
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   are just a one-time fee.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   It's the expense ratio that comes
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   day after day, rain or shine.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   So that's really, if you're long-term,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   the more important fee.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And the trading cost becomes less.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   If you're trading all day
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   and you're like a maniacal day trader,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   that is why SPY is so popular
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   because it is just going to be,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   the more liquid it is,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   the more it's going to just
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   completely digest all these orders
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   right at NAV.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And the arbitrage will be almost,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   the arbitrage is so good
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   that you're paying the NAV
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   virtually almost all the time.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   So that's why as you get further out,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   in terms of your investment horizon,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   it's probably better to go to the cheaper funds.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Even if that does mean an extra BIP
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   and a spread or something,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   it's worth it because it goes away
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   as time goes on.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   But I'd go even further to say
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   if you're long-term
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   and you're a bogey head type,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   there may not be a reason
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   to buy the ETF at all.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Unless you trade or have a portfolio
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   where you just want to use ETFs
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   because you want to move it around a little bit.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   In index mutual funds,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   especially Vanguard,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   you can get the same fee virtually
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   or if not cheaper.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And they do the same exact thing.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And they benefit from that
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   securities lending revenue I talked about.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   So I don't really see any reason
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   to use the ETF
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   if you're a buy and hold bogey head.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   There's really no...
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   You don't have to mess with all this.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   So I'm not thinking ETFs
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   should do really much
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   to replace the index mutual fund
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   if you're long-term.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   It does make a difference
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   if you're holding your account
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   at Schwab or TD Ameritrade
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   or Fidelity
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   where if I wanted to buy
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   and I did it through Fidelity
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   or if I can even buy it through Fidelity,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   I don't even know if I can,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   just at the mutual fund,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   they would charge a commission, 25.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   I mean, I think if Schwab,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   if you bought a Vanguard mutual fund,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   they're going to charge a lot of commission dollars.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   But they don't charge anything to do an ETF trade.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   So if I'm holding my assets at Schwab
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   and I wanted to buy a Vanguard fund,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   if I can do it with an ETF,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   it seems like a better deal.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Absolutely.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And this is part of why Vanguard launched ETFs,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   to be able to distribute better
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   because of that reason.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   So if that's the case,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   then obviously that scenario with VTI
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   becomes the better deal.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And it's one other thing too
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   that I want to talk about
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   is Vanguard has a unique structure
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   where their ETFs are a share class
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   of the open-ended mutual fund.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And they're the only ones who have this.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   They have a patent on it.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And so when it talks about tax efficiency,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   their mutual funds have the same tax efficiency
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   as their ETFs within the same fund.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   It's spread across all classes of shares equally.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Now, the fee might not be exactly the same.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   I mean, actually Vanguard now
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   is actually lowering the fees on their ETFs
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   because administrative costs
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   are actually less expensive to them.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   For holding shares away at Schwab or Fidelity,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   the cost to hold shares there is less.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   So they're actually now passing that savings
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   on to the ETF shareholders.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   So if you look at the VTI
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   or some of the other funds,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   the ETF share class
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   is actually starting to trickle down
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   even below the Admiral share class.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   But the question is taxation.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   I was talking with a client a few weeks ago
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   who said they made the mistake last year
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   of buying a Schwab S&P 500 mutual fund
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   in their taxable account last year.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And they got a tax distribution
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   at the end of the year.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Pretty big one, apparently.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Enough to make them upset about it.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Rather than buying an ETF like IVV
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   in their account
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   where they would not have gotten a tax distribution.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   So from a investor standpoint,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   an individual investor standpoint,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   can you tell me why an ETF
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   would not make capital gain distributions
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   while a mutual fund
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   that's following the same index might?
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Not including Vanguard
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   because as we just talked about,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   they're the same.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Right. Vanguard is a special case.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   And if you're using Vanguard's index funds,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   you don't have to worry about this.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   I am looking at the Schwab.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   You're right.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   This mutual fund put out capital gains
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   almost religiously every year.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Yeah, I hear you. That's annoying.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And look, this tax efficiency of the ETFs
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   that you hear about is fascinating
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   because for some people,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   it's the number one benefit.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   ETFs probably have 10 features like a smartphone,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   but some people use two or three
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   or hardly anybody use all 10.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   But tax efficiency might be the most important thing
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   for certain people
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   because of those taxable counts.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Now, the reason this happens
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   is that creation redemption process,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   the portfolio manager is able to sort of
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   wash out gains if there are some
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   in that process of the creation redemption.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   All that's happening in the primary market.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   It doesn't affect the investors.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   The mutual fund, you just don't have that.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   So the mutual fund's a lot easier to understand.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Somebody's running a fund.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   They have to,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   let's say somebody wants to get out of the fund.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   They're going to have to sell some equities
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   or they have a lot of cash,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   which in case you have cash drag.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   But let's just say they don't,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   they have equities.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   You got to sell something to meet those redemptions.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And so that's going to trigger a gain.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   And the people who sat there get it,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   which is annoying because all you did was sit there.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And that is what ETFs don't have.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So you rarely get a capital gains distribution.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   There are a couple of cases when you will see them,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   but they're usually in special situations
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   and more exotic products.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   But the big general ones don't really, really do that.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And I think that that track record
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   of not having capital gains is very valuable.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   They didn't design the ETF to sidestep the tax rules.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   It was a happy accident
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   when they made the creation redemption,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   which was really largely to keep the costs
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   of trading separate from the investors.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   And by doing that,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   they kind of made the taxes separate too.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And that is a big win for ETFs.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   And frankly, I think that's more fair.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   I think mutual funds,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   when you look at them side to side,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   have the unfair way.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I'd almost, you know,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   obviously ETFs have a lot of advantages.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   This is one where I almost feel bad for mutual funds
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   because it is an unfortunate way.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   It's almost like you just get taxed
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   when you make the action as the investor.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   If you sell, that's on you.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And that you do get the capital gains distribution
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   if you sell your ETF,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   but you don't get one just sitting there.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And I think that's a more fair way to get taxed.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   - Gene Fama won the Nobel Prize
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   in economics a few years ago.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   He and his research partner, Ken French,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   they wrote an op-ed Wall Street Journal article,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I want to say 13, 15 years ago,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   where they talked about this problem
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   with mutual funds, not with ETFs.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   They said that ETFs were doing it the right way.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And it's the way that mutual funds
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   are not tax-efficient.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And the Congress needs to change the way
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   mutual funds work so that they become
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   on a level playing field with exchange-traded funds.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   So it was clear a long time ago
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   that this was a better mousetrap
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   from a tax perspective.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   - Yeah, and I think some people say,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   why doesn't the ICI lobby Congress?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   First of all, I'm not sure they'd want to, you know,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   mess with what's obviously good tax revenue.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Number two, I'm not sure they fully understand it.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And number three, the ICI, nowadays,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   is filled with people who have ETFs and mutual funds.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Like these companies all have both, mostly.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Back in the day, I might've been smarter
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   if the ICI was more full of just active mutual funds.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   But now it's, ETFs are kind of part
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   of all these big companies' lineups.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   And so it would be hurting, you know,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   a lot of their own members.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   So, you know, that's why I don't think
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   you'll see any pushing to undo it.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   But I could be wrong.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   It's possible that somebody decides to change rules.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   - Hasn't happened.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And by the way, ICI is the Investment Company Institute,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   which kind of is a trade group of fund providers.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   - Yes, ICI is like the big trade group.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And as we know how Washington works,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   usually you need some group like that
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   to sort of get the ball rolling
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   on what would be otherwise pretty complicated tax issue.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And I just don't see them taking that initiative.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   - We said Vanguard doesn't make any difference
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   because everything's treated the same
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   and it's all tax efficient.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   In fact, Vanguard is really super tax efficient.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And we can get into why this sort of double structure
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   of having it as a share class of a mutual fund
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   is actually even more tax efficient
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   'cause when there are cash redemptions
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   in the mutual fund side,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   you can get rid of stocks that are at a high cost
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   and are at a loss
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   and therefore gather losses in the fund.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   And then when there's a redemption on the ETF side,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   you can get rid of low cost basis stocks.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   So it really is a super efficient model
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   that I always wondered why other fund companies
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   didn't just go to Vanguard and pay them a fee
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   to use that invention that they have a patent on
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   because it is so tax efficient.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I mean, it would make your open to a mutual fund
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   so much more tax efficient
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   if you had an ETF share class of it
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   and you could get rid of the low cost basis stocks
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   so you don't have these distributions
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   at the end of the year.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   But I've not heard of any company
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   that has successfully gone to Vanguard
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and gotten them to let them use the patent.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   I've heard that companies have tried
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   but that Vanguard wasn't listening.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   - This comes up sometimes when we talk about
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   this new structure coming out next year
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   called non-transparent actives
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   where they have a way to have an active ETF
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   not have to show its holdings to the public every day.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   It almost seems like licensing Vanguard's patent
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   would make more sense.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   I agree with you.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   I'm not totally sure why more people haven't thought of that.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   And the patent runs out, I believe it's 2022.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   - I think that's what I've heard, yeah.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   - So you can either wait it out.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   They might not be, I mean,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   the flows are getting pretty rough out there.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   And I think a lot of active firms
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   don't wanna wait that long.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   So maybe they just don't wanna have to pay Vanguard
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   which they see as like the Amazon of this industry.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   - I have heard that as well.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   - Yeah, I mean, there could be some pride involved here.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   I just don't wanna, I just can't do it.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I can't bring myself to pay Vanguard.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   They're doing enough damage to me.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   So, but yeah, I don't know.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   I think maybe they want more control, who knows.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   But I would think that might work better
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   than what they're gonna do,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   which is if they come out with these sister ETFs
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   or something close to their,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   where do they price them to not alienate
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   the existing mutual fund investors
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   yet appeal to the low cost obsessed ETF type investors?
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   So this is a real puzzle they're gonna have to deal with.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   I'm curious to see what they do.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   - Well, speaking of the future,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   first off, how many ETFs are there now in the US alone?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   I mean, how many do we have?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   - Okay, well, I can give you an exact figure.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   It's gonna be around 2,200.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Well, I'm here with my steady terminal, 2,369 in the US.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   - And do you-- - Worldwide?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   - Well, sure, worldwide, sounds good, go ahead.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   - I'm gonna guess 8,000, let's see what the survey says here.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Probably gonna be, 'cause it's interesting,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   the US only has about a quarter of all the global ETFs,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   but we have about 70% of the assets.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   It's a huge market in terms of assets.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And we have about 85% of the volume.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   So a lot of the action is here,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   but there's products galore in other countries.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   - So I've heard that the number of--
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   - The answer is 8529. - Oh, okay.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   - So 8,529 worldwide.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   - So screening these things could be a real issue.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   I've heard that with index mutual funds
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   and ETFs that are tracking indexes now,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   equity indexes, that there are more equity index mutual funds
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   and more equity index ETFs than there are stocks
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   on the US Stock Exchange, is that true?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   - Oh, yeah, this chart, I put this in a bit once.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   I took the number from Sanford Bernstein
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   that there was, I don't know, something like 7,000 indexes,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   and it was a huge spike up.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   You can imagine almost like a hockey stick growth
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   in the number of indexes.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   So what we did is we took that chart, referenced them,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   and we put the number of stocks on top of it.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And you can see the number of indexes
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   just fly right past the number of stocks.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Everybody went wild.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Even Gunlock commented on this on Twitter.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   It was just a chart that just struck a nerve
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   or a cord with people.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   I think a nerve is better,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   in terms of indexes taking over.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   A couple things.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   A, according to that number of 7,000,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   there's more mutual funds than stocks, too,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   and nobody cares.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   And to quote Meb Faber,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   there's also more words than letters.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And for some reason, nobody has a problem with that.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   In other words, there's so many stocks,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   there's so many combinations you can make,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   it doesn't matter.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And there's an index association group,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I forget the exact name,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   but they claim there's 2.7 million indexes.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   So that number from Sanford Bernstein
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   was actually way underdoing it.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   A lot of indexes have many versions,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   but largely you could have a billion indexes.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Most of the money is going to be connected
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   to a small, tiny portion of those anyway.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Most of them are just meaningless.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   So you could go ahead and design,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   if a statistician or a mathematician
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   were to take the number of stocks
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   and figure out how many different combinations
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   you could have,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   I bet the number is infinity.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   So, you know, it doesn't really matter.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   It's just more, look, it's a sign of the times.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   It strikes to the fears people have
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   of passive sort of like taking over.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   And that's what that chart did,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   but it was much more optic than reality.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   - Now, you said that a lot of these funds
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   don't have a lot of money in them.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And I think somebody once referred to them
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   as zombie funds, where they're the walking dead.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   So what happens when one of these funds
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   doesn't make it and it closes?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   I mean, how do people get their money out?
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Is it a taxable event?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   How does that work?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   - Yeah, that's the problem is you will,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   if it went up, you'll get hit with a tax bill on that.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   You don't lose your money.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   I mean, and yeah, you're right.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   There's a lot of ETFs to close.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   In fact, if you look at all the ETFs
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   in the US ever launched,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   about a quarter of them have closed.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   That's a pretty high number.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   You know, this year we're looking at closers
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   that may rival a record.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   It could be close,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   but a lot of issuers will just close them
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   if they don't work.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   The good news is hardly anybody's in them
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   if they close them.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   So you're probably not owning the ones that close,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   but let's say you do.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   The problem isn't that you lose your money.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   The problem is you would get hit with a tax bill.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Either you sell it and it's at a gain.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   So there you go.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Or if you just forget,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   they'll cash everybody out at the NAV that day.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   So the tax consequence is the reason
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   that there's a "closure risk" in ETFs,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   but it's not credit risk per se.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   And it's important to distinguish the two.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   But this is part of the reason
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   why there's people are nervous,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   advisors in particular,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   about going into ETFs that don't have a lot of assets.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   And so welcome to the plight of the small issuer,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   especially the indie issuer
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   that doesn't have a big distribution.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   That's why you see some of them going to zero fee
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   and trying to lure you in in other ways
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   because they know how hesitant people are
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   to buy ETFs that don't have, say,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   like over 50 million in assets or 100 million.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   It's hard out there.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   And there's currently, I don't know,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   about half of all ETFs are probably under 100 million.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   - Is that the breakeven point, do you think,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   for a new ETF, 100 million?
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   - I've heard 50, 30 to 50 is like the breakeven.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   We consider 50 probably like you won't close.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   If you look at the average closure size,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   it's about 30 million.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   So we think, okay, if you're at 50,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   you're probably not going anywhere
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   'cause you're probably like breakeven at least.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   If you're 100, you're officially in the middle class.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   We consider the middle class to be 100 to a billion.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And then once you're over a billion,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   you're rich, you're elite.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   You're the top 10%.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   - Okay.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   - And so about half of the ETFs
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   are below that middle class line.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   And about half of those are in the danger zone,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   which is 30 million or less,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   which are the most at risk of closing.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Yeah, there's a ton of them.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Like 500 are probably in that danger zone.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   - As an investor, if I am looking at an ETF,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   do you think that that should be one of my criteria,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   that it has at least 50 million?
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Or if it doesn't,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   I know that I'm taking more risks somewhere.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   - I don't want to ever say
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   you should never look at small ETFs
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   because some people think
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   that if there's not a lot of volume or assets,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   then you can't actually even trade it.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   But the fact is you could put a limit order
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   and probably get a decent price
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   because there's never a liquidity risk
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   to being in a small ETF.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Again, a market maker
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   or somebody could always do a creation.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Like, but there is the closure risk.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   If getting that tax bill is that annoying to you,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   and it's, you just say,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   how much is this strategy interesting to me?
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   'Cause keep in mind,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   a lot of the innovation in the financial world
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   is in the ETF market.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   I call it the Silicon Valley of investments
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   because a lot of PhDs,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   a lot of smart people are putting products out.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   They may not have 50 million for a couple of years,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   but you may love the product.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   I would say, okay, well, how much do I love it?
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Is it worth the potential of this tax bill?
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   There's a percentage chance that it could close
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   and you have to weigh that.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   But I wouldn't necessarily not go into a small product
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   because you feel like in like an equity,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   you could get stuck.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   I don't really see that
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   as the spread could be a little wider.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   But again, as long as you use a limit order
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   in trading these smaller ETFs, you're probably fine.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   So I also have a soft spot for the indie smaller issuers.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   I think a lot of them are so overwhelmed
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   by BlackRock and Vanguard.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   It's tough, but there's a lot of good ideas.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   A lot of the innovation happens with smaller issuers
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   that are closer to their markets.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And so some of the best products are coming out
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   from the small guys
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   and it takes them a couple of years to get to 50 million.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   So I don't wanna say make that a hard rule,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   but just understand that closure risk tax bill possibility.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   - Just wanna remind listeners
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   that Eric's book is called "The Institutional ETF Toolbox."
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And it has a lot of this screening, due diligence,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   explanation of cost and spreads and when to trade
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   and a lot of good information in the book.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   So let's talk about the future.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   A lot of things have happened.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   It used to be a lot harder to issue an ETF,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   let's say if I decided Rick Ferry wanted
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   to issue some balanced ETFs.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   I bring that up because there are so few balanced ETFs
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   out on the marketplace
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   that are just a basket of balanced funds.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   - Let's go into this a minute.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   This is a fascinating question.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   - Okay.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   - 'Cause my podcast host, Joel Weber always says,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   why isn't there an ETF with the ticker easy
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   that just holds everything?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   And I'm like, they exist.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   They're called asset allocation.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   BlackRock has a couple, but they have almost no assets.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   I mean, BlackRock's have a couple billion,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   but for them that's small, but it's a small category.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   The reason, and I'm pretty sure this is my theory,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   but I'm pretty sure I'm right,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   advisors are the biggest consumers of ETFs
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   and advisors want to be the pickers.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   And once you, if the advisor shows up
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   with just one product on their sheet,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   that may not go over well.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   So I think that's largely the reason why,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   plus when you go balanced, it's a one size fits all
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   and not everybody has the same needs
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   as the way that balanced fund does it.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   You think that's a good theory?
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   I'm curious to get your thoughts.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   - No, I think the first part of that is absolutely correct.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   I mean, advisors don't want to give up control
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   of doing something in an account.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   And if they can take a four funds, five funds, 12 funds,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   15 funds and put it in a portfolio and make it complex,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   it gives them a reason for being
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   'cause then they can rebalance it.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   And people get a statement
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   that has a whole bunch of things on it.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   And it looks like the advisor's doing something
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   and therefore the advisor should get paid a fee.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   In reality though, if the client on their own
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   went out and bought a balanced ETF
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   that has four or five basic index funds in it,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   the client would do just fine.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   So where you're talking about the ETF marketplace
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   is focusing on advisors.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   This product, this balanced product that I'm talking about
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   would focus on a new and huge potential market.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   And that is the individual investor
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   who is embracing ETFs faster
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   than I think the market and the ETF companies
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   really understand.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   From my business, and I deal with
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   almost all do-it-yourself investors,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   they're buying ETFs.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And they would really like to have balanced ETFs
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   for the small accounts.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   To me, there's a market there,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   but it's not the traditional market of institution.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   It's not the traditional market of advisor.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   It's a new and huge market
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   of direct to the do-it-yourself investor.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   - Yeah, I think you're,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   well, you're definitely onto something
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   with the do-it-yourself individual investor.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   That is an area that is growing.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   All the research shows that.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   We heard some anecdotal data from BlackRock about that.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   I think the number I heard is the percentage,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   this is ballpark, but some people ask me,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   "Who owns the ETF?"
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   And, you know, it's roughly can break down
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   like 10% institutions,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   depends on how you define institution,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   but then maybe 15% do-it-yourself retail,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   the rest is advisors.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   So a lot of times when I do my analysis,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   I default to advisors
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   because they are the majority of the users.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   But you're right, that direct,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   especially with the commission-free trading,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   I'd only imagine that category is going to grow.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   - Absolutely, it's huge.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   It's huge.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   I don't really, again,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   I sometimes talk to ETF providers and say,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   "Hey, why don't you launch this or that type of fund?"
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   Because it seems there would be a market for it.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   I remember back in the 1990s, early 2000s,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   I said, "Hey, why don't you do factor ETFs?
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   "Why don't you have value and growth and quality
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   "and this and that?"
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   And they said, "That'll never fly."
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   That was back in early 2000s.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Anyway, seven, eight years later,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   there's factor funds everywhere.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And now I'm saying,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   "Well, why don't you do balanced ETFs?"
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Because this market out there,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   this huge individual investor market,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   do-it-yourself market, would use them.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   And they would appreciate them,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   especially if there was some tax advantages to doing it.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   But I throw that out there.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   I'm not going to do it myself.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   But in addition to that,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   SEC has just made it easier for companies to issue ETFs.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   They no longer need this thing called exemptive relief.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   And could you go through some of the regulation changes
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   that have taken place?
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   - It speeds up the length
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   and shrinks the cost for launching.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   So it expedites the launching of ETFs.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   And it was long overdue.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   There was no reason to have this exemptive relief,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   especially as ETFs got to multiple trillions in assets.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   At one point, I think there was 1,200 ETFs filed.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   But this comes,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   this would have sped up launches 10 years ago.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   I don't think it does much today.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   I think that over the last 10 years,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   you know, this is why I call the ETF industry the pterodome.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   It is absolutely brutal.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   The investors are so cost-obsessed,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   and they will sell you out for like one basis point.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   And we have a chart we call the cost obsession thermometer.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   And we just look at the percentage of flows
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   going to ETFs that charge 20 basis points or less.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   That number this year is at an all-time high, 98%.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Last year it was 96%.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   If you throw in index funds, you go to 99%.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   So it is really unbelievable.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   And sometimes the fund will come
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   and cut a fee by one basis point
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   and actually can move the needle in flows.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   So I think over this year especially,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   a lot of people in the pipeline
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   might think twice before launching
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   because of just how utterly difficult it is to find success.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   And I think that is why this will not do much.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Or I would say this rule might bring up some people
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   who might have, you know, make it easier
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   and might attract some new issuers.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   But at the same time,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   the increasing brutality of the market,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   I think, will scare an equal or more amount away.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   So you might have even net less launches going forward,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   even with the rule.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Although 10 years ago,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   I think this would have really expedited launches.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   I don't think it does much now.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   What about the new rule on non-transparent ETFs?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   Presidian funds, LLC, active share, ETF structure.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   This is all very new, where in the past,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   you had to disclose every day what you had in your ETF.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Now, under this new structure, you don't have to anymore.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Is this going to change things for the active managers?
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   They hope so.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   When you look at the active mutual fund space,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   active fixed income mutual funds,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   they're seeing over $100 billion in inflows this year.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   So as long as rates remain steady or low,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   I think active fixed income mutual funds are dandy.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   They will probably just continue to launch
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   the occasional transparent active fund.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   On the equity side,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   a lot of the managers are hesitant
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   to put their secret sauce out there in an ETF
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   that shows their holdings every day.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   I think they're overestimating how much people care
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   in terms of both front running
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   and just copying their holdings.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   I don't know if there's that much interest in doing that.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   But anyway, it's their livelihood, right?
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   They don't want to share their stocks and their weighting.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   So there's a couple of different models of ETF structures
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   that will have a fund trade on exchange,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   but without showing the holdings every day.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   That way they can have some degree of secrecy
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   while at the same time benefiting from a lower cost,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   overall expense ratio, and tax efficiency,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   which is huge, as you mentioned earlier.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   So there's a couple of different models.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Some will have like a special representative
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   who will work with the AP, like a blind trust.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   And some will have a proxy portfolio
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   where the stocks are very close
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   to what the manager holds or correlated,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   but not what they hold.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   And so there's a couple of different ideas
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   on how to do this.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   And SEC just approved the first one,
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   which is the Presidian model.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   I expect the other ones to be approved at some point.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   And so you have companies like J.P. Morgan, BlackRock,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   T. Rowe Price, the list goes on.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   American Century, I think,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   is the first one who's going to come out next year.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Monster active managers,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   hoping this is a way for them to participate
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   in this sort of new world of ETFs
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   without having to show their holdings every day.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   I'm pretty bearish on it,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   but this is what they think might help
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   stop some of the bleeding
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   on the active equity mutual fund side
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   and help them regain some of the customers
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   that they might be losing.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   - Okay, one last question,
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   and that has to do with the new thing out there,
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   which is ESG,
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Environmental, Social, and Governance ETFs,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   which are the new, new thing,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   the old, new thing being smart beta.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   And I guess the old, old thing being just beta,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   which is still collecting the most money.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   So we went from beta,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   which is still doing well,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   to smart beta, which seemed to have slowed down.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   And now everybody is ESG-ing.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   How does the landscape look for ESG investors?
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   - Okay, so there's two ways to look at ESG ETFs.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   If you look at them isolated,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   you could go, okay, well,
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   ESG ETFs went from 6 billion to 15 billion this year.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   They more than doubled their assets.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   They're growing faster than everything else.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Okay, fine.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   But 15 billion is, what is that?
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   That's 0.5% of all ETF assets.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   So it's microscopic.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   And it's microscopic compared to the hype, especially.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   There's always articles on ESG.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   - What?
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Oh, I like your tongue.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   - The hype around ESG, the press is good.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   You know, look, a lot of the media is based in Manhattan.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   I think this is an issue that's important to them.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   I don't know how much of the rest of the country
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   cares about ESG investing.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   There's some disconnect.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   I've seen it happen.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   There's a disconnect that happens a lot
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   with what the media world might consider important
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   and what actually investors care about.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   And I think ESG may fall in that gap.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   Because given the media coverage and the years,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   they've been out for 10 years now,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   15 billion isn't that much.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   Although again, you gotta give them credit for growing.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   So I'm not sure how much actual raw demand is there.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   The problem with ESG is that it's subjective.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   I don't think any two people
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   would have the same exact criteria
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   of what should be in or out of their ESG ETF.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   So it might not fit what you want.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   And some ESG funds have Exxon.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Some don't, right?
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   A lot don't.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   Vanguard might do it one way.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   They might include alcohol.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   But you may be fine with alcohol.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   This is where the subjectivity also, I think,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   is a headwind with ESG.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   The good news for ESG
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   and what I thought caused the bump up
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   is Vanguard coming out and vanguarding the category.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   They came in cheap.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   And now the rest of the launches since then,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   for the most part, have come in cheap.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   So there's now a lot of ESG ETFs
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   that are well below 20 basis points,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   which is that magic number where all the flows go.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   So I think that helped a lot.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   And as long as they're dirt cheap,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   they have a fighting chance, I think, to get flows.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   But I'm yet to see real money.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   When you said smart beta, let me just give you a compare.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   Smart beta ETFs have $920 billion.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   Whatever, what's 15 into $920?
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   Whatever that is.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   I'm a CFA, but I would have to get out my calculator
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   and take a look.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   It's probably 30 or 40 times the amount of assets of ESG.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   So that's my quick take on that.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   But millennials apparently are the generation
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   that's most interested in them, according to surveys.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   But again, I also think the surveys might be overhyped
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   because who is going to answer on a survey
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   they're not into ESG and risk being judged?
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   So I think that the numbers on the surveys
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   might be higher than reality because people fear
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   of being the person who doesn't care about ESG.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   I always tell people, if you're really into ESG,
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   why would you not want to own the companies
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   that you think could be better?
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   What you should do is just buy a passive index fund
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   like from Vanguard or BlackRock or State Street
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   because those corporate governance groups,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   once you own the whole index, you're now basically
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   giving your money to Vanguard or BlackRock's
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   corporate governance group to go and vote
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   and they're very ESG oriented.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   So I always say that like active managers are out there.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   They are concerned about the products and the profits.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   And then the rest of the ownership is passive.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   They're concerned about ESG.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   So I find that's actually like those two things
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   can live in harmony.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   But if you buy the whole index, you own everybody
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   and you own BlackRock's voting on all those companies,
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   including the bad actors.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   So I would argue that the ESG route might just be
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   to own the whole market via the index
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   and give them your votes.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   - The large holders of total market index funds
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   like Vanguard and BlackRock have a ESG responsibility?
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   I didn't know that.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Could you explain that?
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   - Yeah, so BlackRock seems to be a little more aggressive
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   with things like issues like gun control and climate change,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   but they're all really interested
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   in corporate governance.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   For example, Vanguard has six principles
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   for good corporate governance,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   including things like independent oversight,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   a board accountability, shareholder voting rights
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   consistent with economic interests,
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   annual director elections and minimal anti-takeover devices,
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   sensible compensation tied to performance,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   shareholder engagement.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   So I think when it comes to Vanguard,
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   none of that is, "Hey, make me more money."
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   But I think they're saying,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   "Look, if we set up the right parameters,
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   it gives the company the best chance to be successful."
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   So I think they're focused more on the G of ESG
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   and just trust them to vote in the ESG,
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   to push for ESG policies within those companies.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   But that's up to how investors wanna play it.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   - Thank you, Eric.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   You've been extremely helpful

[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   I remember when we first met at a conference
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   and first heard you speak,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   and I knew you were gonna go places,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   and you certainly have.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   So looking forward to a lot more from you in the future.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   Thanks for being on the show.
