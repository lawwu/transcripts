[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:52.600]   It's Friday and today, of course, thankfully, that means live Q&A.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.880]   On the Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills,
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.880]   insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.400]   a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. I am your
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.720]   host. Today is Friday. And as with every other Friday, at least in which I can arrange the
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:24.400]   appropriate technology, we do live Q&A. You call in, we talk about whatever you want.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.440]   Love doing these Friday Q&A shows and plan to be doing quite a few of them over the next
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.560]   few weeks. I'm sitting in rural France right now, in rural southern France for the next
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.520]   month. So really enjoying our time here. I always get questions about, "Joshua, what
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.000]   are those birds in the background?" So today's birds are the French ones. I assume that you'll
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.840]   hear by their accent that they are appropriately French. These Friday Q&A shows work just like
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.280]   any other call-in talk radio show works. Basically, it's a live show where you can call in, talk
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.840]   about anything you want to do, want to. Any questions, any comments, anything that you
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.960]   want to chat about with me for the benefit of the audience. To gain access to these shows,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.520]   you need to become a patron of Radical Personal Finance. Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.600]   Find me there on Patreon and sign up to support the show there. And that will give you access
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.280]   to one of these Friday Q&A calls. I would love to have you there supporting the show
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.800]   on Patreon. That just helps me keep the call volume down to, you know, go for four, five,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.400]   six, seven callers, something like that. Otherwise, it winds up being 30, 40, 50 callers and I
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.160]   can't do that in a reasonable amount of time. We begin today, however, with Trey in Texas.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.800]   Trey, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.720]   Hey, thanks, Joshua. We just had our first child and I wanted to ask your opinion on
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:51.920]   how to save for his future education. I mean, I still think college is a pretty good deal
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.720]   right now. I think it's making some kind of ominous sounds though and I'd like to maybe
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.000]   not have it tied up to where it has to be used on a traditional university, although
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.160]   that's probably where he'll end up going, I would guess. But, you know, 18 years is
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.640]   a long time. So, I just wanted to ask how you would recommend we save for him to either
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   attend a university or do some kind of other further education after high school.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.480]   So common question, we'll give it the rapid treatment here, although I certainly expect
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.320]   this to be a 15-20 minute conversation because there's a lot of things to do. But let's
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:37.440]   begin with the basic concept of I don't see much point in saving for a child's education
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.880]   if that means that you're going to sacrifice some other goal that is more important. So,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.280]   a couple of baseline points. Most of us who are parents want to make sure that our children
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.320]   have the best life that we can offer them. However, financially speaking, college should
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.080]   be one of the lower financial priorities. The classic comparison that I have stated
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.600]   many probably thousands of times, at least hundreds, maybe not a thousand, is simply
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.080]   this. You can borrow for kids college, you can't borrow for retirement. So, if saving
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.240]   for your child's education in the future is costing you some other goal that is more important,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.080]   you shouldn't do it. I don't think it makes any sense for you to shortchange your retirement
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.920]   savings in order to save for your child's education. But more importantly, that's common
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.880]   advice, more importantly, I would say, I don't think it makes any sense for you to shortchange
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.680]   your personal freedom goals in order to save for your child's education. I don't think
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.120]   it makes sense for you to shortchange your business building goals in order for you to
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.320]   save for your child's education. I think it's one goal among many and so you should order
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.880]   your goals and pursue whatever you think is going to be the most important aspect to it.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.360]   Now that said, many people like to have clear goals related to finance and I think that's
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.480]   a really good idea, right? I have them, you have them, we all have them. We have this
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.000]   idea of segmenting our money and it helps us to make thoughtful decisions. So, I don't
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.340]   see anything wrong with saving for your child's education. The second argument that I like
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.720]   to make is I believe that saving for college, if saving for college is causing you to shortchange
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.460]   something today, I believe that saving for college is the wrong move. I believe that
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:38.760]   every dollar invested into early childhood education is going to pay off far more than
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.040]   a dollar down the road, right? The time to invest in a child's education is in the early
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:52.760]   years because college is such a simple thing for somebody who is either talented with some
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.920]   marketable skills such as athletics or somebody who is cognitively, has a high IQ, high cognitive
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.480]   capability. College is very simple to pay for whereas other things are more difficult.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:12.560]   And so, if I had to choose between enrolling my child into a better quality school, a private
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.280]   school versus a lower quality school, I would pay for the private school. If I had to choose
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.560]   between hiring a personal tutor to come into my home and homeschool my children to the
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.080]   cost of whatever that costs, knowing that I'm not going to be able to save for college,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.600]   I'm going to do that. If I had to choose between taking my children world schooling and traveling
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.480]   around the world with them, I'm going to do that instead of saving for college education.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:45.520]   If I had to choose between enrolling my children into career-oriented, interest-oriented, passion-oriented
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.120]   summer camps, I'm going to do that before I'm going to save for my child's college education
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.920]   because I believe those are a better bang for the buck. They make more sense. And again,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.860]   college is easy to solve financially. And so, what I don't like is the fact that many
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.360]   parents prioritize this ephemeral idea of college savings if it's hurting something
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.040]   today. And in my experience, most parents are not in tune with the things that they
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.560]   can do today that are far more likely to impact the course of their child's life than the
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.740]   things that you can do down the road in college. And so, if I have to choose between those
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.040]   things, I am going to choose those early childhood opportunities. I'm going to choose that expensive
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.960]   summer camp if that's the one that really fits my child's needs. I'm going to do homeschooling
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.080]   and I'm going to give up a family income so that we can homeschool instead if we're into
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.920]   that. I'm going to go and enroll in the private school. I'm going to do those things early.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.720]   And so, thus, most of this conversation really goes out the window if you buy those arguments.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.080]   Now, I don't say them lightly, but consider those first two things so that you can understand
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.200]   what might be the best before you get to what type of account or what type of investment
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:09.440]   asset should I use. Because I believe that those points are really valuable and really
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:15.040]   important. Now, the third thing that we don't know is we don't know what the cost of college
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.220]   is going to be. And so, for people who are just saying, "Well, I'm concerned that college
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.160]   education is getting expensive and I just want to have a little bit of money," I usually
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.280]   say, "It's probably not that big a deal." Right now, today, in 2021, in the United States
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:36.240]   of America, you can get a fully accredited college degree with no scholarships, just
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.360]   straight out the door tuition for $10,000 total. Get a bachelor's degree. So, anybody
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:48.000]   can simply pay for that. And so, there are lots of options. And I think that in the future,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.040]   those options are going to be far more numerous. So, when someone says, "Well, I'm saving for
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.400]   tuition at a local, just run-of-the-mill college," I often say, "Well, don't bother so much."
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.680]   The people who I really think should prioritize college savings accounts are those who have
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.720]   a family culture and a personal culture where they're deeply committed to formal education
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.880]   and they're saving for big-dollar colleges. You're saving for a big-dollar Ivy League
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.000]   college. You know there's going to be a $200,000 tuition bill or whatever number. Then that
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.400]   makes a lot of sense to save for. But if you're just saving a few thousand dollars, it doesn't
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.240]   make a lot of sense other than to make you feel good about, "Hey, I'm investing in my
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:31.720]   child's future." The next point that I like to make is a lot of times you need to understand
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:38.680]   that the so-called college savings accounts are only modestly effective at actually funding
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.560]   college. Why? Well, the first point I point out is the savings. And here I'm talking about
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:49.200]   things like 529 programs, educational savings accounts. Those are the two most popular.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.880]   Although you can still do educational savings bonds, but nobody does that. Those types of
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:01.400]   accounts are limited in impact with regard to actual tax savings. So a lot of times someone
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:07.240]   might come along and say, "I've got a 10-year-old child and I want to set aside money for my
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.960]   10-year-old child's education. And so I'm going to put aside $100 a month." Well, if
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.440]   you run the math on what you might expect with $100 a month going into a stable account
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.160]   of some kind, you're not really saving anything. And what most of those college accounts do
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:32.760]   is they don't actually save. They only allow you to avoid paying income taxes on the increase
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:38.040]   in the account value to the extent that there is an increase if used for education, which
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:44.520]   all told, in most of the time, that's not a very big tax bill. And so most college accounts
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.960]   have limited effectiveness. They make you feel good and the numbers don't make that
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.680]   big of a difference. So you might pass some of those barriers. And so some of the things
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.040]   that I look for when someone says, "I want to save for my child's college." First thing,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.280]   I look for a young child. You have a baby, so this is perfect. The second thing that
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:09.000]   I really like to see is can that account be front-loaded? So instead of $100 a month,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.200]   can you just put in 10 grand? Because now you might start to get enough gain. If you
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.000]   put in 10 grand or 50 grand or whatever you're trying to put aside for a child's education
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.960]   and you do it up front, as front-loaded as possible, then you now have much more opportunity
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:33.720]   for the accounts to grow so that college accounts can actually be really powerful and really
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.760]   useful from a tax savings perspective. I also look for someone who wants to save substantial
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.160]   money. And if those things are there, then yeah, I think college accounts are a good
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.340]   fit for that. Now, you didn't ask just about college accounts, so let me give a number
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:53.520]   of alternative ideas that I think make a lot of sense to consider. The first idea that
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.880]   I think makes a lot of sense to consider is simply acknowledge the fact that we don't
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.600]   know where you're going to be at that point in time and we don't know what college is
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.760]   going to be like. And so if you buy the idea that it makes sense for me to square away
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.960]   my financial life first, then set up your financial life in such a way that it gives
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:21.720]   you personal flexibility in order for you to be able to have cash flow college. What
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.800]   most wealthy parents do when the time comes for college is they simply pay for it. They
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.360]   simply pay for it, right, out of cash flow. And so think about if you're taking out a
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.320]   mortgage, right, maybe you have a 30-year mortgage but you got a brand new baby. So
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.840]   to make out an amortization schedule and say, "We think we're going to be here. I'm going
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.000]   to pay this mortgage on an 18-year schedule so that I have no mortgage payment when my
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.360]   child is in college." If you are thinking about buying a new car and taking out a car
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.920]   payment and you want to pay for your child's education because, "Hey, my son is going to
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.880]   college at 18 years old," well, then just make sure that your car payment is not going
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:04.960]   to exist during that time so that you can simply cash flow the college payment. These
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.920]   are useful ideas. Now, what can you invest in? Well, if you want to invest in a college
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.760]   account such as a 529 account or an educational savings account, you're going to be limited
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:23.000]   to mainstream mutual funds or to a private college's growth and investment in prepaid
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.600]   tuition type of program. Ignoring prepaid tuition, because I think that's kind of a
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:34.160]   silly program for most people to be involved in, ignoring prepaid tuition, basically those
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.160]   accounts work really well if you want to participate in mainstream investments. Now, you don't
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.600]   technically have to do this. For example, if you're proficient with investing, you've
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.640]   got some really high return investment, you can do a self-directed educational savings
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:54.880]   account. You can put an LLC into that educational savings account and you can use that LLC to
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:01.120]   invest in higher returning investments. You could buy tax lien certificates and put them
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   in your ESA. You can actually set up a checkbook LLC through which you self-direct your 401k,
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.960]   your IRA, and your ESA. And so if that's of interest to you, then you can do that. Most
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.680]   people aren't going to do that because most people aren't interested in that kind of investment.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:23.720]   So the people who I would try to steer towards 529s, ESAs, things like that, those people
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.920]   are generally people that I would say are just going to be mainstream investors, are
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.200]   looking for passive investments. They don't have to be involved. They're not going to
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.800]   be out on the weekends painting shutters and mowing grass, etc. And they're just looking
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:43.680]   for simple, smooth, and done for you. And in that case, if you have relatively small
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.760]   dollar amounts, an ESA is a good solution. If you're looking to put more money aside,
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.320]   a 529 is a good solution. And these are fine with the caveats that I have said. What I
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:58.280]   would say you look for is choose your state carefully. You can invest into any state's
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:04.280]   529 account. I think that Clark Howard does a really good job of listing various 529 accounts
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.320]   and their fees. So I've always sent people to him. He and his staff update that regularly.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.040]   So go and find Clark Howard's 529 account guide and follow his advice if you're looking
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:20.460]   for that kind of ordinary mutual fund type of approach. The things that have often been
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:30.000]   more exciting to me, though, are more unusual ideas, things that look differently. So I'll
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.280]   just give you maybe a few, I'll just pick a few of them. One approach is to make sure
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.520]   that your child doesn't need college and that your child is able to support himself by the
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.200]   time he actually gets to college. I think that this is a good plan. I think that it
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:52.120]   can be done with academics. I have had so many friends who have been academically capable
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.720]   and their scores were good, their grades were great, and they got paid to go to school.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.280]   And so, again, back to my philosophy of early childhood rather than saving, I think that
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.560]   makes a lot of sense, is focus on that versus the finances. I would love to see someone
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.400]   invest into a business that helps their children. I think one of the best things you can do
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.800]   is teach your children how to support themselves at an early age. How you do this, I think
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:27.640]   it's up to you. Maybe you go to ifixit.com and you buy a set of electronic device tools
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:33.360]   and you teach your child how to set up a phone screen replacement, a battery replacement,
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:40.920]   basically an electronic fix-it business. And he can make money fixing things. Maybe your
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:47.640]   daughter is very gifted with a certain art and so you teach her how to use that in a
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.280]   commercial capacity. And so I love to see some kind of business created that's kind
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:58.120]   of sidelined, but I really believe you can invest into it. I think this, if you took
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:04.920]   the average family, and I know you're not average and I'm kind of intentionally avoiding
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.120]   asking you a lot of questions because I'm just trying to give you ideas. You have a
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.620]   newborn, right? You can go in any direction. But let's say you took the average person
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:18.560]   that's spending $150 a month on a 529 account. What I would do is I would say, "Why don't
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:28.680]   we spend $150 a month instead on your personal education budget for book purchases and online
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.880]   course purchases?" Here's a credit card. What I would do is set up a privacy.com debit
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.760]   card with $150 limit per month. And I would say, "Here, any course you want to buy on
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:49.320]   Gumroad, you can do it." I would rather my child spend $150 a month on courses on Gumroad
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:56.140]   rather than set it aside in a mutual fund so that he can learn how to trade crypto,
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:01.980]   he can learn how to play in NFT space, he can learn how to make money from an automated
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:07.280]   Twitter account, he can learn how to make money with his pickup truck. There's so many
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.820]   things you can do. And to me, that seems like a better return on investment than anything
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:18.880]   in this strictly financial space could be. And so I really believe that education is
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:25.460]   more powerful. And if you do the education well, then you minimize a lot of the need
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:31.960]   for the expensive college tuition. And then your child can choose, with your guidance
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:38.040]   and coaching, whether or not college is a good fit at that future time. I just believe
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.080]   that the world is going to be fundamentally different 18 years from now. A second way
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:49.480]   I think that you can approach this, and by the way, I don't think that the monopoly
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:59.160]   on education is going to be held as strongly as it is today. Today, going by the data,
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:06.120]   I have to continue to argue that college education seems like a really good investment. It helps
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.400]   your child to have more options, opens doors all around the world, etc. But I don't think
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.560]   that we're going in that direction. That's the old model. And most of the old things
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.480]   that college provided, a sorting and filtering mechanism for society, helping your children
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:30.120]   to have an appropriate dating pool for an appropriate mate, giving basic technical qualifications,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:40.040]   many of these things are being replaced with different mechanisms. The sorting capability
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:46.720]   of a well-run Twitter account is far more powerful than the sorting capability of being
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.240]   in the right class at the Harvard School of Business. And what you see is that colleges
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:20:00.080]   are generally not keeping up with the rapid pace of change necessary for reacting to a
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.520]   changing marketplace. And so a lot of the markers of things that people really wanted
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:10.740]   historically are different. So I'm not throwing it out. I'm not an extremist totally opposed
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.280]   to it, but I think it's different and thus requires more flexible thinking. Other things
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.920]   you can do. I think that if you're interested or have the capability, I think it makes a
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.000]   lot of sense to say, "I'm going to invest into a specific asset that's going to be for
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.520]   the benefit of my child." And so one of my desires, which has been stymied by my global
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:38.960]   wanderings, if I weren't so involved in constant perambulations, then I would have more opportunity
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:45.000]   to do it. But one of my ideas has been, I want to invest into a house and I want each
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.280]   of my children to have his or her own house to start them off in life properly so that
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:58.400]   they have an asset that it can be a hands-on business lesson for them. And so maybe you
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.600]   look at it and say, "You know what we'll do is we'll go ahead and I did have $10,000 or
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.600]   $20,000 set aside that I was going to use and put into a 529 account. But what I want
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.880]   to do instead is I want to go ahead and use that $20,000 as a down payment on a rental
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.360]   house. I want to rent a house out and the goal is, can I get the tenants to pay this
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:23.160]   thing down over the course of the next 18 years so that my new baby is going to have
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.600]   a house?" And so maybe he lives in it, maybe he rents it out and the tenant income pays
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.780]   for his school. But now we have something that is number one, a business so he can get
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.340]   involved with actual business and start building those business skills. He has an opportunity
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.840]   for work so we can spend time together working on the house, fixing it, etc. He has a house
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:50.760]   and we have an opportunity for a genuine family business with all kinds of side tax benefits
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.760]   and planning benefits, etc. To me that's the kind of goal that for me is just more exciting
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.880]   than a 529 account and is vastly better from a tax planning perspective, potentially better
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:08.480]   from a return perspective if the property is well chosen. But even if you just said
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.880]   the house we're going to get no benefit from appreciation, we're going to get no benefit
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.980]   from tax sheltering, we're just going to focus on mortgage pay down, it's a pretty good move
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:27.440]   if you could do that compared to the flip side of the 529 account. I like the idea of
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:34.360]   my children having collections of things. So maybe your goal is I'm going to buy a silver
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:40.160]   American Eagle or maybe a monster box of, that's too much, a tube of silver American
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.360]   Eagles for every year of my child's life. This is something I like to do, right, where
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:50.120]   you make sure that, hey, you know what, you were born in 2021 and here's a cool coin collection
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   of silver or gold, you could do it with gold too, here's a gold coin for every year. Now
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:04.040]   I'm not arguing that those, I'm not arguing that a, let's say you buy a gold American
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.200]   Eagle, an ounce of gold every year instead of putting the money into a 529 account. I'm
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:15.800]   not arguing that the gold will outstrip the return of say a mutual fund. Is it possible?
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:22.920]   Yeah, but it's unlikely. But there are other benefits to it, right? Now we have real physical
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:28.320]   assets that are interesting, the child can touch, can hold, assets that aren't recorded
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.960]   in the same way in terms of financial assets held at financial reporting institutions.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.360]   And so there is a little bit of fuzziness there when it comes to reporting who owns
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:42.880]   what. You have a choice of when you actually gift the asset. And so I'm not arguing you
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:48.400]   should break the law, just one of the benefits of things like gold coins. So there are lots
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.840]   of things you can do and I would love to see, I guess to lay my cards out clearly on the
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:24:00.360]   table, I believe that if you will focus on your child as an individual and consciously
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:10.600]   choose to spend money actively on the interests, just the interests that your child has, then
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:19.840]   I think that you can do better with those investments than you can with just putting
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.040]   the money aside in a 529 account. So I guess one final point would be this, right? The
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.760]   other thing that I think you should seriously consider is I expect by the time 18 years
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:37.280]   comes by, I expect college to be free in the same way that today education is free of cost
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.960]   for anybody who wants it, just like it's always been, right? With a library card, now we just
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:48.720]   have way better resources with what's available for free online. I expect schooling itself
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:56.240]   to be free. And so the way I look at it is this, I think that government schooling at
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:04.440]   the college level will be "free" by the time my children are at college age. I expect it
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:10.160]   to be as worthless as anything that is free actually is. And so I still expect there to
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:19.120]   be very high dollar educational institutions available, but I'm not willing to save, especially
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.600]   in college accounts, for those high dollar institutions. If at some point in time my
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:30.920]   child decides, "You know what? I want to go to an elite Ivy League university," then either
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.560]   I'm going to be wealthy enough that I can simply pay for it and I'm going to choose
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.800]   that yes, this actually is appropriate because we're going to move you into an upper class
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:46.000]   or we're going to provide the things that come with that, or let them pay him to come,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.880]   or let her figure it out. But I'm not going to set aside these accounts for something
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:56.560]   that is completely unknowable, especially when the benefits of the college accounts,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:05.080]   for example, are not there. So what I do, what have I done? I don't have college accounts
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.160]   for my kids. It doesn't make any sense for me to do that. I'm not opposed to it, as I've
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.400]   tried to state very clearly, I don't think you're wrong to do it, I'm just not going
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.320]   to do it. What do I do? Well, I invest in my children, I try to buy them all kinds of
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.100]   things that are going to stimulate their creativity, I try to buy them cool stuff that's going
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:28.600]   to help them, I'll spend money on fancy gear. Like right now with the travels, I've bought
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.640]   my children kind of mediocre cameras, but right now I'm thinking, okay, I should go
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:40.800]   ahead and what I need to do is go ahead and buy my almost eight-year-old a brand new GoPro
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:47.520]   with a Media Mod kit so that he can be doing high quality video and high quality camera
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:53.880]   shots and start learning a skill of videography. And to me I view that as an investment. That's
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:59.640]   a bet and a probably a better investment than money in an account. And so whether it's,
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:06.120]   I want to be committed to my children's education and I'm finding lots and lots of ways to spend
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:11.500]   money on that now, and as far as I can see, we're only getting started. And so I'm going
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:17.500]   to spend a lot of money on my children's education and I'm going to do it in the very best way
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:23.500]   that I can. And if the time comes when college comes, I've got a couple backup options, right?
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.500]   I'm going to teach my children and they can always go to a country where college is already
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:34.500]   free. Any US American or anyone from anywhere can right now today apply and go to a German
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   university without being German, without speaking German and go completely tuition free. Has
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:45.500]   to cover his own room and board. Any person can go to college working part time. I put
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:52.500]   myself through a private school, pretty expensive, did it part time. Anybody can apply and work
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:28:03.700]   my way through, graduated debt free. Any person can go and simply go to a less expensive school
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:09.620]   and go through slowly, etc. So I think I've said my point. If you want details way back
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.540]   in the beginning of the show, I did a whole series of shows, I think I did like six hours
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:18.860]   or something on every college account and how to use it and educational savings bonds.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:25.180]   I'm focusing on these ideas because that stuff is easy and obvious. If you decide that what's
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.740]   best for us is to go ahead and set aside a college savings account and we want to do
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.900]   it and we don't want to be messing around with buying houses or gold coins or anything
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:40.460]   like that, go and open a 529, go to Clark Howard's guide, use one of those 529s, you'll
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:46.460]   be done in 15 minutes and move on your way. It'll work fine. But I think that by doing
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.180]   that you're missing out on the really high return activities which are all these other
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.820]   things that I've mentioned.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:58.380]   >> Steven All right, yeah. I think you kind of convinced
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:06.260]   me. I was kind of leaning that way anyway. So yeah, I don't think I'm going to do a 529.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.220]   just set aside money and if it does help you feel better
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.280]   to have an account for your new child,
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.000]   what I would say is choose your budget
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.120]   and set up an account for your new child.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.080]   Set up a bank account
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.560]   and if you were gonna put $200 a month in a 529 account,
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.120]   just put $200 a month into the bank account
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.000]   and then start to see what adds up.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.760]   And then in the coming years, it's hard to spend,
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.200]   the only way I've come up with to spend money effectively
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.800]   on the education of my zero-year-old, one-year-old,
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.000]   two-year-old, three-year-old, four-year-old, et cetera,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.120]   is to have my wife as a full-time mother.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.960]   That's it.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.120]   And that's a major cost.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.560]   It's a financial cost to our family, it's a cost to her,
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.800]   and someday our children will appreciate it.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.920]   That's the only way I know to invest in a two-year-old.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.600]   But when your child starts to get to six, seven, eight,
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.720]   all of a sudden, it opens up the world
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.600]   that I'm talking about in a really powerful way.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.880]   And so set the money aside in an account
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.740]   and then think about it,
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.320]   that way it's allocated and separated
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.920]   and you feel like you're being a responsible father.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.840]   And then, hey, if two years from now you decide,
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.280]   you know what, I really think a 529 account is a good deal,
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.300]   then go ahead and just make a lump sum contribution,
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.160]   put your five or 10,000 bucks in it and move on from there.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.760]   I said 15 minutes, it turned into be 26 minutes.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.600]   Let's go to Thomas.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.420]   Thomas, welcome to the show.
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.760]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.440]   Thomas, you're up.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.320]   - Hey, Joshua, can you hear me?
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.680]   - I can hear you now, go ahead, sir.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.520]   - Hello?
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.360]   - Go ahead, please.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.680]   Got you loud and clear, Thomas, go ahead.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.320]   - Hey, Joshua, thanks for the call and all that you do.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.040]   Yeah, I just wanna say I do appreciate the last question.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.720]   I have a newborn as well and I look forward to any updates
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.800]   that you have on your process over time
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.920]   and if you're willing to share on how you end up
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.980]   introducing activities or especially business aspects
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.500]   to your children in the future.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.520]   I did wanna just say for Trey,
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.440]   one plan that I had actually was,
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.320]   I actually set up a 529 account
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.040]   and just let family and friends know that,
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.600]   hey, instead of clothes or toys,
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.520]   that they can contribute to that on my child's behalf
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.320]   and that can get some funding that way.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.920]   - I think that's a great idea, absolutely.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.820]   And people like it.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.480]   There's no question that people like those accounts.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.320]   - Yeah.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:36.340]   I personally had a question about crypto interest
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.460]   and lending platform accounts like BlockFi,
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.140]   Celsius, Nexo, Cake, et cetera.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.660]   I'm specifically using some of them to park funds
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.940]   for passive income and/or while waiting
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.560]   for other opportunities.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.660]   Just kind of wondering what your thoughts were
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.380]   about any of those accounts, if you had any,
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.740]   if you've met anyone that maybe at conferences
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.380]   you've been to that has anything to say about them.
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.860]   The current stable coin yields are between
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.040]   like seven and 10% right now,
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.840]   so it seems kind of attractive.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.880]   A lot of them seem to be venture capital backed,
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.220]   so it seems like there's a little bit less risk there
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.780]   and the liquidity is great.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.700]   So just wondering what your thoughts were.
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.780]   - I have nothing bad to say about any of those ideas
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:21.720]   or platforms.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.500]   My only thought, I'm totally in favor of doing it
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.340]   and I applaud you for being involved.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.660]   My only comment is simply,
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:36.500]   while I appreciate the long-term potential
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:41.500]   of some of these ideas and while I am wholeheartedly
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.380]   in favor of building and developing and participating
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.580]   in a fundamental reorganization
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:52.580]   of the global financial markets, I'm not scared of that.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:56.780]   I think this still does have to be viewed as speculation
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.420]   rather than as investment.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:05.100]   And so I am very much in favor of speculation,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.900]   but I try to label clearly what is speculation
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.980]   and what is investments.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:15.980]   And so in these marketplaces, because the technology
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.380]   and the platforms are so new
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.680]   and because they are relatively untested,
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.700]   there will be problems and hijinks
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.100]   and just things that occur.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.020]   And so whether it's a marketplace being hacked
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:34.340]   and completely losing, having some fundamental flaw
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.580]   that's shown, whether it's legislative risk,
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:43.860]   I talk, debate with people about things like,
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.420]   well, is the US American government gonna ban Bitcoin?
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.740]   I always say, listen, you're dealing
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.420]   with the same government that for 40 years
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.760]   banned you owning a gold coin.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.000]   So it took 40 something years.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.780]   For 40 years, you couldn't even own a gold coin.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.620]   And before that, that was every one he used,
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.460]   legally speaking.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.620]   And so, I mean, don't say nothing's impossible.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.920]   And so my only point would be label your activities here
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.980]   very clearly as speculation
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.140]   and then assess your overall financial position
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.360]   to make sure that this speculation makes sense in your life
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.940]   based upon your needs, your goals and your personal risks.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.620]   As long as it's labeled speculation, I'm fully on board.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:32.960]   - Do you still consider it speculation
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.860]   because the platforms are new,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.900]   even though the asset itself is a stable coin,
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.980]   which there are certain stable coins that are audited
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.820]   and fully backed and rarely have any sort of fluctuation?
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.480]   - I can't, from personal experience and personal knowledge,
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.480]   I can't speak effectively enough to every single detail.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:00.200]   And so I can't say,
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.080]   I don't have a BlockFi account at the moment.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.480]   I don't know how to do that.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.000]   And so I can't say from that perspective,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.080]   from personal experience.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.680]   I have read some about it to get an exposure to it,
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.160]   but I can't say it from personal experience.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.380]   And so my only comment would be
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.100]   that even the whole concept of a stable coin to me,
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.300]   unless I'm wrong and feel free to tell me why I'm wrong,
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.820]   the concept of a stable coin is a fundamentally new concept
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.100]   that while it's related to an external asset
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.060]   and the idea is, hey, let's tokenize the external asset,
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.580]   that to me still feels very much like a new
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:41.340]   and a brand new and exciting market,
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.480]   not as a tested and tried and true approach.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.320]   Am I wrong?
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.080]   - No, it's still definitely a new asset,
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.440]   even though it's linked to another one to link its value.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.180]   But yes, it definitely, I could see a future where,
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.680]   I don't know, the US government wanting their own
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.360]   US dollar coin tries to,
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:09.680]   I don't know, have some sort of law against stable coins
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.340]   or other ones that they don't control.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:15.940]   So no, there's definitely that potential.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.460]   - Yeah. - I can acknowledge that.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.540]   - I would like, I have been working very hard
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.740]   to upgrade my education and make sure that I'm competent,
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.540]   but I still have not renamed this podcast
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.180]   as the DeFi podcast, right?
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.780]   It's not, I'm not there yet.
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.740]   And so I can't speak to it effectively enough
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.520]   to say here's how it all works.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.020]   My only point would be that you can have,
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.580]   I guess the best example that most of us could relate to
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:45.580]   would be the mortgage-backed securities crisis
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:50.580]   of the late 2000s, that you have an asset
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:55.160]   that is fundamentally always considered a very safe,
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.800]   very conservative asset, and then that asset was tokenized,
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.860]   or more properly, of course, turned,
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.860]   derivativized, turned into a derivative.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.660]   And then at the end of the day,
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.660]   that derivative was shown to be far less safe
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:16.540]   than previously understood.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:21.540]   And so when you had those mortgage-backed securities created
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.120]   the original creations of that,
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.200]   the original creations were excellent.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   They had the same basic value that they always had.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.860]   But then as the securities were traded
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.860]   and sliced more finely and layered up, et cetera,
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.060]   the market got a whack underneath it.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.700]   And so then one day everyone woke up and realized
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.860]   what we thought was a grade A asset
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.900]   is actually a piece of trash.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.700]   And so everything collapsed.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:58.140]   Now, I can't tell you, and I'm not arguing to say that's,
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.860]   I'm not saying that what you've described is that.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:05.420]   All I'm saying is whenever something new is created,
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:09.660]   there are inherent risks that are not yet known.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.000]   Mortgage-backed securities were a new creation
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.200]   and it took time for the new risks to be known.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.620]   And so this is a new market.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:22.280]   And while the underlying concepts may prove to be sound,
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.420]   and I hope they are, caution is warranted to say
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.820]   we don't know what we don't know.
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.180]   It's no different than anything, right?
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:35.800]   A new medical treatment, a new way of building a house,
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.300]   anything takes time to be tested.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.820]   So I say be involved and understand the risks.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.920]   No doubt you could articulate it better than I can,
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.160]   but be aware that this is speculation.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:53.160]   This is not a time-proven strategy
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.440]   that has been tested through various markets,
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.700]   through various conditions,
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.440]   that has proven itself through various attacks.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.220]   For all of its benefits and glory,
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.040]   Bitcoin is not in any way proven.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.720]   It is a concept that is being proven,
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   but even the whole concept of whether it's a stablecoin
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.540]   or Bitcoin or anything, this is new.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.360]   That's not bad, I just say,
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.380]   from a personal finance perspective, label it speculation.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.560]   So that's my thought,
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.760]   and I look forward to perhaps in the future
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.860]   talking more about it and learning more myself
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.040]   about the strategies that you're using.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.200]   John in Pennsylvania, welcome to the show.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.660]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.600]   - Yeah, that's kind of a weird question, I guess,
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.400]   but things could change,
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:47.920]   but there's a really good chance coming up in 2022,
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.840]   our family will just have a very low-income year,
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.340]   and we have enough liquid savings
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.740]   that we'll get through 2022 and probably beyond
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:04.180]   without any compromises or issues to our lifestyle.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.660]   So, you know, take a vacation or two or whatever,
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.220]   but I'm trying to think ahead as to anything
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:14.260]   that I could do or potentially not do to cause a problem,
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.940]   to take advantage of a year like that
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.340]   that has very low income.
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.140]   Kind of just not being very creative,
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.140]   the only things I could think of
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.680]   is if I wanted to use that low-income,
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.580]   W-2 income to transition any money
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.700]   from certain accounts to other accounts
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.140]   for looking ahead,
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.020]   things like Roth conversions or whatever,
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:37.660]   but I'm thinking more outside the box
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.820]   on things I have never heard of
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.460]   or just things from a personal finance standpoint
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.740]   that could be an advantageous year for.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.100]   Does anything come to your mind about that,
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.140]   or is it just sort of just take care of the basics
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:56.140]   and keep on with good general personal finance?
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:02.380]   - Yes, there are a few things,
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.780]   but I don't know that they're as brilliant
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.580]   as I wish they were.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:10.580]   I think the obvious solution is take advantage
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:14.660]   of as many free money programs as you can.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:19.520]   So whether this is Medicaid health insurance,
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.120]   whether this is,
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:27.140]   if your income is zero, food stamps, right?
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.940]   Or WIC, I guess it's called.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.420]   Sorry, SNAPs, Nutritional Assistance Program.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:37.100]   You can go into government programs
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.300]   if you wanna get involved in that.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.100]   I think that's a double-edged sword.
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.220]   I don't think it's worth most of that,
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.220]   getting involved with most of that stuff,
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.520]   but a lot of people could do that.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.560]   I think the obvious solution is IRA conversions,
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:58.200]   converting traditional IRA assets to Roth IRAs.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.320]   Sometimes maybe there's some kind of low-income program
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.720]   that you could take advantage of,
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.920]   a scholarship fund or something like that,
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.940]   a disaster relief fund, et cetera.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.700]   To me, the only obvious solution that I have
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.600]   is simply the IRA conversions,
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.680]   because that's an income-based scenario.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.080]   You can fill the income buckets with your conversions.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.800]   - Right, and that's kind of where I was going.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.880]   I was just trying to think,
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.640]   is there anything I've never heard of or thought of
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   that that kind of year would be advantageous
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.200]   to do that kind of thing.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.760]   So if there's nothing really that I'm missing,
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.760]   then that's probably a good thing
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.200]   that I haven't been ignorant of some major side of things.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.100]   - I think you would consider college tuition.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.000]   This is the classic, if you have it,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.520]   back to the first call that we began with today.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.120]   If you have college tuition,
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.160]   and if you can arrange to be unemployed
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.960]   in the year before your child is going to college
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:06.640]   so that you can fill out your FAFSA with $0 of income,
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.000]   that can help you a lot on your numbers.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.360]   The only hesitation I have is I think you can go through
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.000]   and you can be involved in a lot of those kinds of things.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.980]   I just question if that's healthy for the psyche.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:24.400]   I believe that welfare damages people,
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.440]   and I don't want to be damaged.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.600]   And so getting on the free money train,
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.880]   I think, has the risk of damaging me.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.020]   And so I want to be super careful about that stuff.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.540]   Also, I would say that if you're the kind of person
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.680]   who can comfortably take a year off,
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.880]   then most of those things are just not at the scale
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.200]   where it makes any sense.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:48.880]   And so it just, what's the point of having $250 a month
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:52.440]   of SNAP probably for food that you wouldn't eat?
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:56.080]   So it's like, there's no reason.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.360]   It's kind of how I feel about,
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.300]   a lot of times about credit cards and things like that.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.520]   I've been doing quite a lot of mileage hacking.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.680]   I've been testing a bunch of strategies and whatnot.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.440]   And the more I do it, the more I recognize
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:13.440]   that if somebody doesn't have a higher returning activity,
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.080]   then this can be a worthwhile use of time.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.920]   But there are so many other worthwhile activities
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.280]   and worthwhile uses of time that I kind of just feel
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   like a lot of it is a distraction.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.600]   And that's how I feel about anything of government programs
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.520]   or rebates or any of that stuff
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.080]   that you can qualify for when you're low income.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.440]   It's like, hey, if somebody doesn't have something better,
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.840]   it's really good.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.560]   The guy who's making just a little bit of money,
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.640]   for him to get SNAP is a big deal
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.220]   and it makes a big difference in his monthly budget.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.680]   But that's not you.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.800]   And so it's like, it's the opportunity cost
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.760]   of going and spending time doing that.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.280]   And it brings down your perspective.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.160]   You wonder about the ethics of it.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.600]   Then you start seeing yourself as the kind of person
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.360]   who needs an extra $3,000 a year of free money.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.120]   And it's just, that's not healthy.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:07.700]   And so my only answer is that I know of is IRA conversions,
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.040]   but beyond that, who knows,
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.500]   maybe the audience has good ideas.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.000]   - Oh yeah, I agree.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.040]   And I think the,
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:20.400]   what you mentioned about the credit card hacking,
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.240]   that's true too.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.400]   I mean, I find I do it very sporadically
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.960]   and only when it's very convenient
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.600]   or very easy and low thinking.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.360]   Unless you're someone that really enjoys it,
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:35.080]   I think it almost is a wash on how valuable it is.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.780]   Just because it takes so much to coordinate
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.540]   all the different transactions and stuff like that.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:42.500]   So yeah, I appreciate it.
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:43.340]   No, that's good.
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.900]   I'm glad I'm not missing anything major.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.220]   One other maybe quick question.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.060]   - Go ahead, sure.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.220]   - I don't know how many followers you have online.
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.060]   - Go ahead.
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.420]   - The other thing I kind of was focusing on
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.180]   in the next few months, especially,
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.860]   but also in the next year,
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.260]   I'm really trying to build up a lot of just basic
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:04.060]   general preparation items for me and my family.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.740]   And this is something where I kind of bump up
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.320]   against frugality a little bit too much
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.360]   and certain things that are really critical,
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.920]   tourniquets and first aid things
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.720]   and things I know that are on my list
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.840]   are high priority items,
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.280]   but I just keep thinking, oh, I'll get around to it
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.880]   or I'll purchase those things later.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.480]   And a lot of people will do some fear mongering
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.280]   and talk about how things are gonna be
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.820]   in short supply in the future.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.160]   How do you, I guess, listening to you sometimes
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.540]   really helps me out 'cause when you're traveling
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.240]   and things are so difficult to get in other countries,
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.280]   I feel like you're really gonna put a good spin on it,
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.200]   how it's like, well, it's just available in America,
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.280]   so just go get it and don't worry about it.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:47.000]   But when you're thinking about things like that,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.840]   when you're living less of a nomad lifestyle,
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.080]   do you just kind of buy all those things
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.080]   and just put them aside and say,
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.440]   okay, this is a one big time purchase,
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.600]   or do you kind of buy slowly on preparation items
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.960]   until you kind of have a good stockpile?
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.880]   What do you do with that?
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.080]   I'm thinking about that.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:09.460]   - It's a fair question because there are some things
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.300]   that are fun to spend money on when it comes to prepping,
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.980]   and there are some things that is not fun
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.100]   to spend money on, right?
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.540]   I like spending money on guns.
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.220]   I like guns, it's fun.
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.560]   I can make a good argument that guns hold
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.600]   and increase their value, they're portable,
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.860]   they're just wonderful, and so it's always fun
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.580]   to go and buy a new gun.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.140]   My least favorite category to spend money on
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.000]   is medical supplies, especially in abundance, right?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.120]   Because medical supplies expire,
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.500]   and so it's like, well, how hardcore am I gonna be?
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.820]   It's one thing to say, I should have a first aid kit,
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.240]   in fact, I'm gonna have a first aid kit.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.180]   It's another thing to say, I'm gonna be prepared
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.460]   for the end of the world as we know it,
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:48.940]   and I'm gonna stack bandages,
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.560]   I'm gonna have two Rubbermaid totes full of extra bandages
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.420]   in case someday I'm fighting off the golden hordes
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.180]   in the street and I come home gut shot,
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.340]   and my wife has to do stomach surgery
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.700]   on my kitchen table, right?
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.940]   That's a little hard for me to get excited
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:08.260]   about actually going out and spending tons of money
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.140]   on bandages in a scenario like that,
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.800]   'cause that's just a little hard for me to believe.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:19.820]   So here is the best approach that I have come up with.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:24.280]   First of all, to ask yourself the question and say,
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.540]   how significant is this event?
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.180]   I was talking to a friend of mine recently,
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.500]   we were talking about medical preparedness,
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.280]   and I feel like I'm probably a pretty good prepper,
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.980]   because I have continually gone from stationary to mobile,
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.500]   and stationary to mobile, and stationary to mobile,
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.500]   and so you understand pretty quickly,
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.500]   what are the things that I need to have,
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.820]   and what are the things that I don't need to have?
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.900]   And you recognize, okay, these are the certain things
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.020]   that are important, so we're talking
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.620]   about medical preparation.
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.420]   And he made the point to me, he said,
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:03.900]   there are two things that can kill you fast
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.020]   before you can get to a doctor,
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.980]   and there are two things, and those two things
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:13.980]   are rapid blood loss and/or anaphylactic shock.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.480]   And so we talked about tourniquets,
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.580]   but I've had a tourniquet for a long time,
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:21.940]   but he said, what you don't have is an EpiPen.
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:26.140]   And he said, you should have an EpiPen
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.460]   for, and none of my children, thankfully,
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.860]   we're an allergy-free family, to my knowledge,
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.360]   none of my children are allergic to anything,
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.980]   we've never had any allergic responses
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.340]   that are a problem at all, but he said,
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:40.140]   you should travel with an EpiPen.
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.100]   And so a few days ago, I was in Spain,
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.500]   and I went to the local pharmacy,
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.020]   and I paid five euros, and I bought an EpiPen.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.140]   And, 'cause it just made all the sense in the world to me,
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:52.180]   it's like, if these are the two things that can cause,
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.860]   if these are the two things,
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.500]   if they happen to my child, that I can jump in the car.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.480]   And in fact, a few weeks ago, my son,
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.660]   my youngest son, was straddling a fence,
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.260]   fell down, bashed his head on the pavement,
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.120]   and gashed his forehead open.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.340]   Wife calls me, says, you know,
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.740]   my son has just fallen down, cut his head,
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:13.860]   come home now, he's at the store.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.340]   So I went home quickly, and it was one of those things
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.060]   where, hey, here's a medical emergency,
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.460]   I didn't know how bad it was, she didn't say,
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.340]   just said he's gonna need stitches,
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.980]   and I had to go home and deal with it,
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.380]   and took him to a local clinic,
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:26.220]   'cause it was on his forehead,
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.660]   I wanted to make sure it was professionally closed.
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.720]   Thankfully, they just glued it closed.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.300]   So it wound up being not a big deal,
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.340]   but it's kind of put me in that image, right?
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.660]   Here I am speeding home to try to pick up my wounded child
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.060]   in a foreign country, and now I'm gonna race off
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:41.900]   and find a hospital.
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:42.960]   How do I find a hospital?
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.780]   Do I have what I need to be able to get to a hospital?
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:49.600]   Well, if you know that the two things that are going to,
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:54.620]   if you know the two things that could potentially,
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:57.500]   that you could die from in about 20 minutes or less, right,
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:58.780]   die in 30 minutes or so,
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.300]   that it might take you to get to the hospital,
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.380]   or flag down help of some kind,
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.380]   are rapid blood loss and/or anaphylactic shock,
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.060]   then it makes all the sense in the world
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.300]   to go in and buy a bunch of tourniquets.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.220]   And so in the past, I was like,
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.700]   I don't wanna buy a bunch of tourniquets, right?
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.300]   You're gonna spend this money and you're never use this thing
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.260]   but now, like, I get it, right?
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.900]   A fresh, it sounds expensive to spend $30
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:23.260]   on a nice cat tourniquet, but then, you know what?
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.380]   I'm gonna put a tourniquet in every one of my cars,
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.980]   I'm gonna put a tourniquet anywhere
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.260]   and several places in my house, like, I'm gonna do it
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.580]   because that's cheap insurance versus the flip side.
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:37.180]   So the first thing is looking at what's gonna happen
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:38.620]   and how immediate is it?
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:40.980]   It doesn't make any sense in the world for me,
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.040]   if that's true, for the rest of my life,
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.380]   not to always have EpiPens around and tourniquets around
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:50.700]   'cause potentially that could save a life.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.660]   Now, am I gonna stack things deep
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:57.140]   in order to deal with my being gut shot
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:58.620]   on my kitchen table?
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:01.860]   I don't really, I can't see that scenario being so much
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:04.060]   and so when I look at it, as I say,
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.740]   can I have a balanced approach?
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:08.720]   And so with something like food storage, for example,
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:12.240]   I think it's probably a little excessive for most people
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.540]   to start with a goal of saying,
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.820]   I'm gonna save three years worth of food.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.340]   And so I look at it and say,
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.300]   well, let's start with a little bit.
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.300]   What's a month of food?
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.120]   And so for a month of food, that's easy to do
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.360]   and you probably just have more of what you have
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.620]   than a few months.
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.660]   And then by the time you start to get into six months
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.580]   or so of food, then most of that stuff is pretty cheap.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:33.580]   And so I, again, look at it and say,
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.420]   okay, if I'm gonna buy buckets of corn, wheat,
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.580]   rice and beans, that stuff's super cheap.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.640]   You put it outside, it should last for 30 years.
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:46.380]   It's not that big of deal for me to spend 500 bucks on it
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:49.900]   and this stuff is last for decades.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.460]   So my model is start by saying,
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.760]   a short term, three months, six months,
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.620]   and kind of build out.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.740]   And then finally, to try to be well balanced.
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.900]   So what I think is often missing
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.140]   is people aren't well balanced.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.460]   And a lot of the things that you can do to be well balanced,
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.080]   they don't cost a lot of money,
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.060]   it just costs a matter of thinking and hassle.
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.380]   So if you're gonna be unemployed,
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.700]   then this is the time just to make a list,
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.380]   make your lists and then just spend your time
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:20.460]   cruising Facebook marketplace every day or so
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:23.480]   and just moseying around and seeing what's there
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.940]   instead of spending a lot of money
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:28.360]   because the vast majority of so-called prepping items
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.840]   are actually really cheap.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.620]   And if you have time, just wait for a deal.
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.420]   So something that's important to me is a generator.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.300]   And so if you don't have a generator,
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.180]   I think you start with a good one, right?
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.460]   Go and buy a good generator.
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.820]   But it doesn't have to be a lot of money,
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.100]   but just go and buy a good generator.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.180]   But then maybe at some point,
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.260]   you might wanna have a backup.
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.340]   Well, then just wait for a deal to come along.
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:50.260]   And so if you have something,
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:54.340]   if I have a couple of months worth of preparedness,
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.340]   if I have a water filter,
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.660]   if I have a deep pantry
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:00.440]   with some spaghetti and spaghetti sauce,
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:03.400]   and I've got some of the basics,
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.960]   then no, I'm not gonna be in a big hurry
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.460]   to go and spend lots of money.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.300]   Most of that stuff,
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.900]   just sit and wait and find some deals along the way.
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:13.300]   - That sounds great.
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:15.100]   Yeah, and that's exactly where I'm at.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:18.420]   There's a lot of things where I say I'm
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.540]   well beyond the basics,
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.940]   mostly due to your course.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.940]   But yeah, it's these things where I feel like
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:27.660]   I am waiting for deals and I'm getting things slowly,
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.520]   sometimes even free.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.020]   And sometimes I just think,
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.460]   oh, it might be too cheap by waiting for certain things.
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:34.980]   And maybe in some categories I am,
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.420]   like the medical things where you said,
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.420]   blood loss or anaphylactic shock.
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.100]   So I should probably prioritize that.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.580]   That's what it really sounds like I need to do
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.700]   is look at my list while I have time
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.860]   and essentially prioritize it
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:48.780]   and then just work through that systematically.
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.740]   A lot of things also are just time-based,
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:53.620]   making lists of places to go in every direction
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:57.220]   or whatever and having names and directions
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.420]   and numbers for hotels and things like that.
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.660]   I started those lists and then I don't finish them
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:02.500]   and I abandon them.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.580]   So really it's just the things I need to sit down
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.220]   and spend some time on, I think.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:07.720]   - Even if they're 20% done,
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.780]   you're far ahead with 20% done.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:10.620]   - Right, right.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.820]   - So just having thought through,
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.580]   and this is what I said in the course,
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.660]   I don't have every single list laid out.
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.380]   I would love to be so organized that I had it all laid out.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.100]   Right now I'm traveling full-time, so I have nothing.
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.260]   Everything is something.
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.780]   But what I will say, just thinking through stuff
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.060]   is what makes the difference, really.
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.460]   That's 80% of it is just thinking it through.
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:35.740]   So that you said, oh, if I were in this situation,
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:36.860]   what are some ideas?
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:37.980]   That gets you 80% of the way,
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.540]   and the last 20% you finish up.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.380]   I think the only thing I would say
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.700]   is that you wanna be thoughtful
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:47.380]   when it comes to spending money.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:49.100]   You wanna be thoughtful and make sure
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.920]   that you have an exit strategy that you're happy with.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.380]   I think the great danger with preparedness
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:58.140]   is often that it's so emotional for people.
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:02.100]   People often get scared about the end of the Mayan calendar
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:05.220]   or the Hammurabi blah, blah, blah,
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.300]   or the nuke attack or something like that.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:11.220]   And so they respond in a place of emotional fear,
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:14.740]   and then they start just spending money wantonly.
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:19.260]   And then they wind up with the classic pallets of MREs
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:22.780]   in the garage after Y2K
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:24.260]   that they just never did anything with.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.580]   And so I have always wanted to avoid that,
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:29.060]   and I've always wanted people to avoid that.
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:31.660]   So the first thing is don't do anything out of fear.
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:35.180]   If you're acting from a place of emotional fear,
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.220]   there's just no reason.
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:40.580]   Now, be prepared to act against that,
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:42.140]   to be prepared against that.
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.060]   And so I think most of that is financial preparedness.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.320]   I'll give a point.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.460]   So two years ago, sorry, a year and a half ago,
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:53.940]   when it was March of 2020,
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:55.260]   and I was looking at the,
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:59.020]   I started warning about the coronavirus pandemic,
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:01.840]   I was watching the coronavirus pandemic, et cetera,
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.840]   I was feeling the fear of here is what I consider
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.400]   to be the worst case scenario, a pandemic.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.600]   And so I went to the store, I had money,
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.200]   I had a credit card, I went to the store,
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.680]   to the local warehouse store,
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.000]   and I bought carts and carts of stuff.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.560]   And I spent a few thousand dollars.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.720]   My exit plan was I'll probably eat most of the stuff up
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.040]   and/or give it away.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.320]   And so my point is always have an exit plan.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.720]   So I had other stuff, I bought some medical equipment
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.160]   that I thought might help, I bought some extra medications,
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.160]   I bought stuff to treat,
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.320]   if one of my family members came down with the virus
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.540]   and they needed to have fluid,
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.560]   so I stocked up on extra medical stuff
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.440]   that seemed appropriate, oxygen,
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.440]   and did the best that I could
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.400]   with the limited information that I had at that time.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.320]   At that time, we were seeing pictures of people
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.840]   dropping over in the street in China,
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.660]   we had no idea what was actually the case.
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:58.880]   And so I went and I spent money.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:02.760]   And so I think that your lists are the valuable thing to do
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.480]   because then you know how to spend money
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.120]   when it's time to spend money.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.980]   And I felt like I was executing
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:12.640]   that kind of last minute strategy effectively.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:16.140]   I had some basic preparations at the time,
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:20.200]   but I saw the risks mounting very quickly.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.200]   I was looking at the pandemic and saying,
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:25.160]   this is potentially very, very bad.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.960]   And because this is very, very bad,
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.120]   potentially very, very bad,
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:34.120]   this is a good move for me to go ahead and spend money.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:37.440]   And so that was a point where there was an acute risk
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:40.020]   and I was spending money fast.
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:45.020]   Now, thankfully, while the pandemic has been significant
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:47.760]   in its impact on all of our lives,
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.640]   it's more been on the order of run of the mill,
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.600]   like big significant, as long as you didn't suffer death
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.160]   because of actually being infected.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.340]   For most of us though,
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:02.340]   it hasn't had the widespread shortages
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.040]   that I thought were possible.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:07.660]   It hasn't been a dramatic economic collapse
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:08.760]   that I thought was possible.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.580]   So far, although we're seeing increasing rates of inflation,
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:16.400]   so far it hasn't been a massive catastrophe,
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.560]   financial, you know, it's not a hyperinflation.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:23.440]   And so, so far we've done pretty well
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.440]   and it's not been as bad as I feared.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.360]   So when I left where I was living,
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.920]   by that time I made, when we decided to leave,
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.900]   I had several months and for basically several months,
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:35.300]   we bought some fresh vegetables,
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.840]   but we ate a lot of storage food.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.000]   So I ate down several months worth of food.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.880]   And then I donated the rest of the food
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:44.160]   to a local food shelter, food pantry,
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.720]   that was systematically, had been throughout the pandemic,
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.080]   systematically giving away food
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.240]   to people who were in need of it.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.360]   And so I felt like it was no, it was a win-win.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.560]   I was just happy to donate a couple thousand dollars worth
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.760]   of bulk foodstuffs to people who needed it more than I did.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.660]   And it was a simple and effective exit strategy.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.080]   So when you're looking at money,
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.160]   ask yourself, what's my exit strategy?
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.080]   And this is where there's a big difference
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.760]   between hard tangibles, some that are easily sold,
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.880]   something like, I don't know, a new gun or ammunition,
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.520]   versus something that's a little bit more difficult,
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.840]   like medical bandages.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.380]   The medical bandages are important,
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.640]   but what I would be inclined to do
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.760]   would be to have some medical bandages and then go cheap,
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.940]   like buy lots of, you know, sack, linen cloths
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.680]   or something like that, that, yeah,
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.960]   it's not as good as proper medical gauze,
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.960]   but it allows me to feel like I've not been careless
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:42.800]   just because it was expensive.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.400]   But when it comes to something like, I don't know,
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.160]   a new gun, if you need one,
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.960]   very few of us need another one,
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.760]   but a new gun, it's like, okay,
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.600]   if I go and I buy a brand new gun today,
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.980]   that gun just simply won't lose value.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.920]   If I put a lot of rounds through it,
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.300]   it might lose 10% or 20% of its value,
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.760]   which I might make up if I sell it
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.800]   private party in the future.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.200]   Yes, if I take it back to the dealer,
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.200]   I'll take a 20% loss on it,
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.240]   but so you know your downside.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.200]   So if you know your numbers
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.640]   and you know what you're dealing with, you're good to go.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.720]   Same thing with my generator example.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.960]   If you go on Facebook and I did this, right?
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.280]   I bought a generator and I had it there, used it sometimes,
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.440]   and then I just store my stuff on Craigslist or Facebook.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.000]   This point, store my stuff on Facebook,
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.600]   just sell it again and put it in money
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.680]   and then turn the money into the next piece of gear
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.520]   in the next place.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.280]   And so in the used market, very rarely,
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.520]   if you're at least thoughtful about shopping
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.920]   and you're shopping in the used market,
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.080]   very rarely can you not get out of your stuff
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.360]   for maybe just a 10% hit.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.740]   And so the numbers are actually not as big
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.200]   as you otherwise think.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.680]   What is often the case is that you're unaccustomed
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.200]   to thinking about tangibles as being financially valuable.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.040]   And this is definitely something that did take,
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.040]   has taken me time to change.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.900]   We're so financialized in our thinking
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:11.820]   that we exclusively look to our net worth statements
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.840]   and the digits that are written on our spreadsheets
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.300]   as reflecting our value.
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.420]   And if those digits are not changing,
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.820]   then we feel like we're not making progress.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.780]   But that's simply not true, right?
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:27.780]   If you buy a generator and you spend $500 on that generator,
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:31.700]   you can sell that generator at any point for $400
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.460]   in 24 or 48 hours.
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:35.580]   And so that is a real asset.
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.700]   And while it's harder to account for on a balance sheet,
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.380]   when you're spending money on durable tangibles,
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:45.540]   it's actually something that does have value.
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.840]   You're not spending money,
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.340]   you're just saving it in a different form.
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.900]   And so that would, I guess, be the last thing, John,
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.960]   is simply that a lot of the purchases
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.460]   that you make for prepping are not actual expenditures.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.580]   They're either, they're savings
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.900]   just in physical tangible forms,
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.900]   or they're insurance, right?
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:10.900]   The EpiPen, or I just did a post this morning
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.000]   on my social media about my GPS transponder
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.020]   that I travel with, right?
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:15.860]   It's insurance, right?
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.620]   I feel good knowing that I have an SOS button
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.940]   that I can push literally anywhere on the planet
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:21.780]   and help will get there.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:22.620]   It makes me feel good.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.700]   So it's insurance.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.700]   And so either view it and say,
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.460]   this is an insurance payment,
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:32.460]   or this is just a transfer from fiat money to tangible,
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:37.300]   and it's not the same as just going
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.920]   and spending money wantonly.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.740]   - Yeah, no, I agree, and I appreciate the perspective.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.420]   That's a very good way to frame it.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:48.300]   And yeah, I can say that's true.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.260]   Every little incremental preparation I do,
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.500]   it does bring more peace of mind,
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.140]   and I think it's more peace of mind
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.060]   than the expense that it was.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.220]   So it's good advice, thank you.
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:01.420]   - Good, my pleasure.
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.700]   All right, we go on to Houston, Texas.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.540]   Welcome to the show.
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.980]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:09.240]   - Hey Josh, this is John.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.080]   Can you hear me?
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.240]   - John, I can hear you well, go ahead.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.500]   - Great, hey, thanks for taking my call.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.340]   Love the show.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:18.640]   I'm in my first year of a potential early retirement.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.740]   I don't own any property.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.020]   I'd be a first-time home buyer.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.580]   I'm looking to just buy something once
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:28.180]   and own it for a long time.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.700]   Potentially buying a piece of land
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.620]   and building the house myself on it.
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:37.820]   Just wanted to talk about financing options.
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:43.580]   I have the funds to hold in sort of liquid investments,
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.220]   such as like equities spread across a few different accounts,
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:49.700]   taxable, traditional and Roth accounts.
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:54.340]   But I was wondering, with interest rates as low as they are,
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.580]   banks pretty much just throwing money at people,
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.700]   I was thinking, man, that's hard to kind of pass up.
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:02.980]   Trying to do some kind of financing
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:05.540]   rather than just paying it in cash.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.220]   So I've looked at a couple options.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:10.060]   I guess one of the things I saw also was
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.420]   some of these brokerages will lend you money
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:14.440]   against your securities.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.180]   So you don't have to-- - It's nine o'clock.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.580]   - Sell them and realize the capital gains
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.220]   and you can kind of use that.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.620]   I was wondering if you had any thoughts
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:26.140]   or just pay it in cash and forget about it.
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:31.740]   - Will the banks lend to you without an income?
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:38.900]   - Yeah, I think that's gonna be the biggest hurdle.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.740]   You know, I'll have a W-2 this year,
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:44.380]   but that's just from the last of the income I was making
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:47.940]   from my previous job.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.260]   And then next year you won't have a W-2.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:55.260]   So I've read about no income type loans,
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.460]   but I'm willing to bet that the interest rates
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.780]   on those if they're even still offered,
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:02.900]   but it would probably make them not make sense for me.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:07.220]   - And are you single?
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.880]   Do you have other family members
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.880]   that are also involved in this decision?
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.220]   - Just me. - Okay.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:20.860]   I think if I were in your shoes,
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:23.700]   I would build it myself and I would just pay cash for it.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.500]   And I can give you some ways
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.660]   to potentially make that more appealing.
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:33.620]   It's certainly you wonder sometimes,
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:38.620]   and am I being stupid for turning down cheap money?
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:43.060]   And I'm not opposed to financing,
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.900]   I'm not opposed to your financing it.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:49.940]   It's one of those difficult things.
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:53.620]   But when I look at it, if it's just you,
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.660]   then, and if you're going into early retirement,
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.380]   you're gonna need something to do.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.900]   And if you're thinking about building the house,
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:05.140]   I think that you would enjoy the project more,
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.300]   building the house that you wanna live in,
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:10.260]   doing it yourself, and making it part
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:12.660]   of your just overall plan to do it
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:15.740]   to a level that's appropriate for you, but do it frugally.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.120]   And you'll probably spend less money
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.500]   if you just simply pay cash yourself.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:25.020]   And you'll be done with the risks of financing.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:32.300]   Because although I don't think it would be risky
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:36.680]   for a financially independent person
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.540]   to borrow money for a mortgage,
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.900]   it's not risky in that scenario.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.700]   Right, if your mutual funds fall apart
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:46.020]   at the stock market, just goes bananas forever.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.380]   Like we got big problems and as we see a lot of times,
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.020]   mortgage companies don't foreclose, right?
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:55.340]   Sometimes they put, they're legally prohibited
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.020]   from foreclosing in some situations.
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:59.380]   And so I'm not someone who says
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.460]   it's just a necessarily risky scenario.
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.400]   But at the end of the day, it is still really nice
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.140]   not to have that hanging over your head.
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.180]   And what I would say is the simplicity
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.240]   of it could also be helpful.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.900]   So here would be some things that I would do
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:18.900]   to probably sell myself on a mortgage.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.380]   On building the property myself
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:24.260]   and just using my own savings rather than financing it.
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.980]   Number one, I would say I could probably get better deals
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:29.140]   and I'll be motivated to get better deals
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.580]   if I just pay cash for it.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:34.860]   One prior point that I should have started with,
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.420]   I should have done it in this way.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.500]   If you're gonna build a property on land
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.060]   that you own or have bought,
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:41.960]   then you gotta deal with the difficulties
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.360]   of a construction loan,
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.380]   which is gonna be more difficult.
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:47.180]   And you're gonna, if you do that also,
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.180]   you'll have constraints on the construction loan
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:53.940]   put on you by your lender as far as the certain designs
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.540]   that they're willing to deal with, et cetera.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.140]   And so it sounds to me like you're the kind of guy
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:01.060]   who would probably be well suited to say,
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.220]   this is the house I wanna live in.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.800]   I'm gonna build the kind of house that I wanna live in
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.640]   for the rest of my life.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.620]   I've worked hard to do this.
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.140]   I'm gonna just make my house.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:09.380]   Now, you'll think about saleability.
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:10.820]   It'd be foolish not to.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.940]   You'll think about code.
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:14.180]   Obviously, you'll have to,
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.580]   in fact, here in Houston, you have no building,
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:17.940]   or sorry, you don't have zoning.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:22.180]   You have building codes, but not zoning laws.
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.020]   So you'll have your own,
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:28.120]   but you can build your own house without thinking about,
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.940]   well, what is the finance officer gonna say
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.740]   about my plans, et cetera.
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:34.420]   And so the construction loan and building your own house
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.100]   is even more of a reason to just use your own money.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.620]   And then if you wanna loan later,
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:42.780]   then consider putting into place a traditional loan.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:46.180]   Second thing I would say is that if you do it yourself,
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.100]   you'll be motivated
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:50.340]   because you're actually spending cash rather than debt.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:53.340]   You'll be motivated to get better deals along the way.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.180]   And so you'll negotiate a little bit more.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:59.920]   You'll be willing to use more used recycled materials,
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.980]   which would be great,
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:06.860]   both from just a good stewardship perspective
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:09.940]   of using good things rather than always buying new stuff,
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:12.220]   and also from a cost savings perspective.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.780]   And then I think one other benefit,
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.220]   you could build a house and do it in such a way
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.820]   that you can skip insurance.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.760]   If you get a mortgage,
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.180]   you're gonna be required to keep insurance.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.660]   I don't know what insurance rates are for you,
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:27.780]   but if I had a debt-free house and I were living
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.380]   and that house was a modest representation of my net worth,
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.420]   at least being from Florida where insurance rates are high,
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.700]   I would use the opportunity
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.300]   to skip having homeowner's insurance.
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:40.100]   And then you could even talk about things like privacy.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.380]   I care a lot about personal privacy.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.700]   You have an opportunity, if you're at all interested,
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.100]   you have an opportunity to have personal privacy
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:54.780]   because you can buy the land, own it in an entity,
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.380]   disconnected from your name.
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.140]   And that's relatively easy to do,
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.740]   first of all, when you're paying cash,
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.940]   and it's even easier to do when you're building a property,
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:05.060]   except possibly with a DIY builder,
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:07.780]   but you have more privacy than if you do financing.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:10.380]   And so those are some reasons I would look at,
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.020]   and I think my guess is I would go with
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.580]   just simply pay cash for it.
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.660]   Be done with the stress,
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.880]   you're getting out of the work life,
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.900]   be out of the financial space, own your house,
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.420]   have your cheap property tax bill per year,
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:22.740]   have your investment portfolio,
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:25.340]   and move on with your life rather than staying
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:27.820]   in the having monthly bills space.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:31.660]   - Right, yeah, that sounds good.
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:34.460]   I have seen that being a cash buyer,
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.980]   you can get into certain areas and get better deals,
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:40.780]   people in different situations wanting to have a quick sale.
[01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:43.920]   So that resonates with me, that second point you made.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.420]   Just, I guess, a follow-up on that,
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:52.420]   putting the house and the property in an entity,
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.540]   is that something that I'd really have to get set up
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.240]   before I purchased it?
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.620]   Or, I mean, would I lose the privacy
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.120]   if I purchased it in my own name?
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.980]   'Cause I don't have an entity set up right now,
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.980]   and if I had to move on something quick,
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:10.060]   and then I guess I'd probably have to transfer the deed
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.860]   from my own name to an entity,
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.260]   would that kind of negate the benefits of it?
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:20.340]   - Go and read Michael Bozell's book on this topic.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.780]   I forget the name of it, I can look it up.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:27.380]   But go and find his book where he talks about setting it up,
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:31.340]   and then investigate the details in your state
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:34.080]   of setting up a land trust in your state,
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.220]   and see what's possible with that.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.460]   You do need to, it would be best for you to do a little bit,
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.160]   if that's interesting to you,
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.720]   it's best for you to do two things.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.080]   Number one, it's best for you to do the research now,
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.500]   and number two, it's best for you to do some practice now.
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:55.840]   My experience with privacy techniques is,
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.840]   first of all, you can think about how hardcore
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.080]   you would want to be with regard to privacy, and why.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.800]   And being as hardcore as possible,
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.800]   just because it's cool, in my opinion,
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.840]   is not the right answer.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:18.140]   You have to have a reason why you care about privacy,
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:21.300]   and enough motivation to actually do it,
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:25.560]   because it is generally inconvenient to do.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.760]   Now, someone like me, right,
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.280]   making my living on the internet,
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.120]   being well familiar with what happens
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.520]   when public personalities get doxed,
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.780]   I have a higher motivation than most people
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:41.800]   to protect my family from the dangers
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.560]   of the internet world, in which you go viral in a day,
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:49.120]   and all of a sudden, for some scandalous thing that you said
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.160]   or some scandalous thing that you thought,
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.080]   and all of a sudden, the world comes crashing down upon you.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.160]   I sleep well at night knowing that I'm hard to find
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.400]   on the internet.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.760]   And so you may not have that same risk profile,
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.860]   and it's totally fine for you to say
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.760]   it's not a big deal to me.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.920]   But the reason I said practice is that what I have done
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.000]   is I have, over the years, I have practiced
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.280]   a lot of the techniques, and I've decided for myself
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.360]   which ones I'm actually willing to do now
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.240]   and which ones I'm actually willing not to do now.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.040]   And so I've backed off a lot on some of the privacy
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.740]   techniques that I've put into place in the past
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.680]   because they were simply too inconvenient.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.480]   And if you want hardcore privacy,
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.240]   then you, if you want hardcore privacy,
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.300]   you need to be skilled with the techniques of privacy
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.400]   in order to actually maintain it.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.560]   It may not be necessary for you, right?
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.360]   Maybe your threat profile is simply,
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.000]   you know what, I live in Texas,
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.280]   I'd like my house to be homesteaded
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.120]   and asset protected for me.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.040]   I would just like to make it a little bit more complicated
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.000]   to look up on the internet.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.440]   Well, maybe there, something as simple as a living trust
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.720]   might give you what you're looking for.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.160]   You can still be on the record
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.560]   with all the utilities companies,
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.760]   you don't have to use a pseudonym
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.440]   with all the utility companies,
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.640]   you don't have to have necessarily all your personal mail
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.480]   go to another space, and you're good enough
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.320]   with a living trust.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.560]   And so I would say the first thing is
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.680]   just think about what you would want,
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.160]   how interested you are in personal privacy
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:27.280]   and how willing you are to actually put it in place.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.640]   - Okay, that would be the main advantage
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.280]   would be the privacy aspect
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.960]   and I guess asset protection potentially as well.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.800]   The house actually wouldn't be in Texas,
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.360]   which has really good asset protection laws around houses
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.360]   being out of state,
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.720]   but would those be the two primary advantages
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.720]   or any sort of financial or tax advantages
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.680]   to some of these entities?
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.480]   - No, there's no financial or tax advantages.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.640]   All they're gonna do is add cost.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.200]   The costs are modest, but they're gonna add cost.
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.680]   So the cheapest thing you can do
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.400]   is just buy the house in your name,
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.720]   register it, be a normal person.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.880]   Have all your mail go there, have your car registered there,
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.560]   that's the cheapest thing you can do.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.600]   Privacy adds cost and complexity
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.280]   and inconvenience to your life.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:17.600]   So if you want the benefits of it,
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.280]   there are some really good things.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.220]   And I think that for a lot of people,
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.840]   and again, you may have really no threat profile
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.600]   where it's just at all important to you.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.480]   But for a lot of people,
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:34.460]   I don't have a tiering system perfectly worked out,
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:37.520]   but just think of it as like lower tier,
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.880]   it's not lower tier, it's middle tier privacy.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.920]   If many people did a few basic things
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.760]   and here are the few basic things
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.320]   and you have an opportunity
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.240]   when you're moving to a place to do this.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:51.440]   Number one is, first of all,
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.920]   don't ever send all your mail to the house.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.680]   If you're willing to simply use a post office box nearby,
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.320]   send your mail to the post office box instead.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.800]   Because that's the simplest thing,
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.840]   is you get on every list and it just floods in
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.980]   when it's at your own address
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.320]   and then you never get the stuff off the internet.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.880]   Anytime anybody Googles your name
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.800]   for the rest of your life,
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.640]   that address is going to be there
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.400]   because you signed up for everything.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.280]   And so kind of 101 is have a post office box.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.280]   If you want to have a private home, you can do it.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.280]   And you register the home in an entity,
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.640]   you can do it with a blind entity
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.760]   where it's not looked through to you.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.080]   The complexities come from financing and insurance.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.160]   So again, back to your threat profile.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.840]   If you want to have insurance on the property,
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.140]   the insurance company is going to know
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.840]   who has the insurance policy.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.400]   And the same thing with financing company.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.640]   That's fine for many people
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.160]   because what many people worried about
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.000]   is I'm on the front page of Reddit today
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.320]   and all of a sudden the crazies start sending
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.320]   porno magazines to my house.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.160]   I don't want that.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.640]   And so it's fine if the insurance company has my name,
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.360]   the financing company has my name.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.440]   The opportunity is because you could set up a situation
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.720]   where you don't need insurance
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.600]   and you don't need financing,
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.600]   then it's relatively easy for you to avoid those risks.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.200]   And so you can just simply buy a piece of land
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:23.200]   and with the exception of the complexity of building,
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.560]   where is the contractor going to do it?
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.760]   If you're going to do it yourself,
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:30.120]   then there's going to be a lot of your footprint
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.560]   from a privacy perspective on that property
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.960]   as an owner builder.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.800]   If you have a contractor build a house for you,
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.600]   then you're good to go.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.760]   And again, you have to ask how worthwhile is this?
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:45.000]   And then you just simply register your car in an LLC
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.180]   and register those things to a different address.
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.760]   And you've got really high quality privacy.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.640]   And then final thing is put all your utilities
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.160]   into a different name.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.640]   And so what you would do is simply set up one identity
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:56.720]   for your house.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.480]   And so it's John Jones who lives at the house.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.240]   The utilities are in John Jones's name.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.120]   That's easy to do in today's world.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.840]   All the magazines come to John Jones at that house.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.440]   And whatever your name is just simply resides over here
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.360]   at a different place a few miles away.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.680]   So it's a really phenomenal system.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.320]   It's really nice to lay your head at night
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.880]   knowing that you're harder to find,
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.260]   that your friends know where you live,
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.520]   but you're not as easily findable.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.640]   You'll lose a few things, right?
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.920]   You won't be able to legally register to vote
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.720]   in that scenario.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.320]   You won't be able to,
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.880]   because you've got to be registered to your house
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.760]   if you're going to legally vote.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:38.840]   And so I don't know anybody who cares about privacy
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.960]   who's registered to vote.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.160]   And there are some other things, but it's really nice.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.900]   And if you're going to be in a place for a long time,
[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:46.580]   it can be one of those things that is easy to set up
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.840]   in the beginning and is really hard to fix down the road.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.080]   So that's why I raise it for you to consider.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.120]   - Yeah, great.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:54.960]   Appreciate the insight.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.600]   Could you just repeat the name of that author again?
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.440]   Michael...
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.960]   - Michael Bazell, B-A-Z-Z-E-L-L.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.480]   I think he's still doing it.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.680]   It's Intel Techniques.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.240]   Let's see if that's still his website.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.300]   Should be, I don't know why he would have changed.
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.640]   So his website is inteltechniques.com.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.780]   He has 232 episodes of a podcast.
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:17.740]   And oh, look at that.
[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:19.980]   He's got a new book that I have not read.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.900]   I read all his other ones,
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.660]   but he has a new book called "Extreme Privacy 3rd Edition"
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:26.260]   that I have not read.
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:30.100]   And so his previous one was the one that I was recommending,
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.260]   but I would definitely, I will order that
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.580]   as soon as I finish recording the show
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.420]   so I can read that book as well.
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:37.780]   And I would recommend get his stuff.
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:41.060]   If you're new to privacy, don't start with his stuff
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:43.000]   because he's hardcore.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.320]   Start with J.J. Luna's book.
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:49.820]   Have you ever read J.J. Luna's book called,
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:52.340]   let's see, my library,
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:55.260]   "How to Be Invisible."
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.460]   Have you ever read that?
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:58.200]   - I have not.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:01.540]   - Okay, so pick up a copy of J.J. Luna's book
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.840]   called "How to Be Invisible."
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.080]   It's an older book.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:09.200]   The most recent edition was published in 2012.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.680]   And so it's a little bit out of date
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:15.760]   with regard to some of the current best practices
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.420]   in the privacy community.
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:23.820]   But what Luna does that the others don't do as well
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:29.160]   is Luna is motivational and really good at storytelling.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:34.160]   And so Luna's book may put it within you
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.560]   a desire to be private.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.620]   And then if you have that desire to be private,
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:45.080]   then go ahead and look at Bazelle's stuff.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.480]   The last thing I would suggest for you,
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.400]   hang on one second, stand by.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:55.600]   The title, I found the title,
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.720]   what I wanna recommend is actually a listener of the show
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.440]   and a client of mine who I've done some work with.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.520]   He just wrote a new book
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:06.000]   called "The Watchman Guide to Privacy."
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.040]   Reclaim your digital, financial, and lifestyle freedom.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.880]   And I think that this is actually probably
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.560]   a better second step for you versus Michael Bazelle's stuff
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.960]   'cause Bazelle is super intense, super hardcore.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.400]   And I think a lot of people read his stuff
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.600]   and just walk away saying, yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.960]   But Luna's stuff is getting a little bit dated.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.600]   And so the book I would say
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.320]   is "The Watchman Guide to Privacy,"
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.960]   "Reclaim your digital, financial, and lifestyle freedom."
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.280]   10 bucks on Kindle.
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:40.360]   So go with that or 18 bucks on Amazon
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.680]   and a really good opportunity for you there.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.340]   I just blanked on the name of the book for a moment.
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:47.940]   So those are my recommendations.
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:49.400]   Start with those books, grab Luna's book
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.640]   and "Watchman Guide to Privacy."
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.240]   If it interests you, then you can learn a lot
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.720]   in Bazelle's stuff as well.
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:57.560]   Make sense?
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.760]   - Yep, great, thanks Joshua.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.780]   - My pleasure, thank you for calling in.
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:04.700]   All right, we go next.
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:05.720]   Two more callers here.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.980]   We go to California.
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:08.820]   Welcome to the show.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:09.860]   How can I serve you today?
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:12.840]   - Hey there, can you hear me okay?
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.680]   - Sounds great.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.440]   - Great.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.640]   Okay, well, Southern California is relevant to this.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:24.640]   I'm young and super interested in house hacking and Nomad.
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:26.640]   And I'm just getting into it.
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.720]   I went to, I think his name is James Orr.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.560]   James Orr, his website.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.440]   Is that the dude?
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.280]   - Yes.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:35.820]   - Okay, I went to his website and watched through
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:39.620]   some of his two hour classes on YouTube and stuff.
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:40.860]   And I'm super interested in it.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:43.620]   And he's talking about Northern Colorado
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:45.260]   and the markets there and going super deep
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:46.980]   into those local markets.
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:51.980]   And I'm curious, I mean, it seems like a very difficult
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:56.740]   and hard thing to get into real estate
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.060]   in Southern California.
[01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:01.100]   And I don't have any illusions about that.
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.540]   But at the same time, some of, you know,
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:06.620]   house hacking and Nomad in particular seem like
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:09.420]   they could be options for me and my wife.
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:10.300]   We have no kids.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.500]   And we're saving a lot right now.
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.460]   So I'm also open to just trying to figure out
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:19.620]   what to do with, you know, some of that cash
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.780]   for midterm, longterm, whatever.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:24.220]   We're currently renting our primary residence house
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:25.580]   for all five years of our marriage.
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:29.420]   And that's felt like a little bit of a non-optimized
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:31.220]   use of money for where we're at.
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:33.620]   And so that's what's got me looking into it.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:37.420]   But at the same time, living in Southern California,
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.500]   we're not like filthy rich or anything.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:43.060]   So I can't like, you know, get million dollar properties
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:44.900]   or anything like that.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:49.900]   And just hearing Mr. Orr talk about some of the
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:52.260]   particularities and some of the reports he's bringing up,
[01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:56.380]   some of the data he just has on what kind of single families
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:58.300]   are available, what they typically go for,
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:01.260]   what typical rents are, just that sort of thing.
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.740]   I was like, wow, that's such good info to have.
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:06.780]   That would be probably invaluable in helping
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.260]   do more research and try to make some sort of a decision
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.220]   about whether we want to get into that.
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.940]   We're kind of also looking at just buying
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:14.260]   our first home anyway.
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:17.500]   So it may happen, even if we don't go the nomad route,
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.300]   we may just be looking for a house anyway.
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:23.380]   So that's kind of all the facts of the situation.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:26.060]   But my question is, where would you go if you were me
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:29.340]   to just start trying to learn more about making
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:33.100]   a better educated decision that's maybe even numbers driven
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:36.380]   based on market statistics and stuff like that?
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.300]   Like I wish I knew everything that he does
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.420]   about Northern Colorado about Southern California.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:42.420]   Does that make sense?
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:43.780]   - It does.
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:47.620]   I would call a real estate agent and I would go on Reddit
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:51.300]   and see what I could find in those two places.
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.980]   First of all, a real estate agent will give you a sense
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:55.540]   of what is possible.
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:26:00.620]   Many real estate agents will not be all that clued in
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:04.620]   to the technical details, but at least that would be good
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:07.260]   to talk with a couple of people who are involved in it
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:10.540]   and get an idea of what the numbers are, et cetera.
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:13.060]   And then I would bet that with a little bit of digging
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:18.060]   on Reddit, you could find some active conversations on it
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:23.380]   or I would go to a couple of the big real estate forums.
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:27.100]   I would imagine BiggerPockets would be a great place.
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:31.300]   I haven't spent much time in many of the early retirement
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.860]   forums in years now, but I would go into some
[01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:37.740]   of the big early retirement forums and just try
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:40.220]   to start a thread and ask the people there
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:43.980]   and get a sense of, try to find some of the people
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:47.180]   who would have the data and have the experience in your area.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:49.020]   Good thing about Southern California is there are a lot
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:52.060]   of people there and you should be able to find them
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.340]   hanging out somewhere on the internet
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:58.620]   with some insight into you, into the situation.
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:00.980]   What stands out to me, and that would probably be better
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:05.020]   for you, by the way, than necessarily the realtor,
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:07.820]   'cause most real estate agents are not gonna be ready
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:09.580]   to go with all that data.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:14.580]   What I would say though is probably it's unnecessary
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:18.180]   for you to get that deep into the data.
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:22.420]   And one of the things that I believe has caused
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:28.380]   a lot of people excessive, just held people back,
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:33.860]   and this includes me, is over-analysis.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:36.220]   And I think this is especially true with real estate.
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:38.660]   You come across a good idea and you think,
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:42.220]   hey, this could be a good idea, and then you say,
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.660]   well, I'm gonna research it and I'm gonna try
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:45.620]   to find the best deal.
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:47.700]   And a lot of times people who spend time trying
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.260]   to find the best deal never make a deal.
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.460]   And if in something like real estate,
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.940]   in order for you to actually make money,
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:58.100]   and in order for you to actually use the strategy,
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:27:59.820]   you just gotta do it.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:03.700]   So the great thing about real estate is it's pretty easy
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.840]   to get into in most situations,
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:08.160]   and it's pretty easy to get out of.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.860]   And I remember before I did my first real estate purchase,
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:15.940]   it just made me, I was so scared.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:18.820]   And then after I got in, got out,
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:20.500]   then all that fear went away.
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:21.820]   I was like, this is simple, right?
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:24.020]   People buy and sell houses all the time.
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:26.900]   And so the way to look at it is basically,
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.660]   what's my downside?
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:32.220]   And what I would say is, in your market,
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:35.380]   I don't think, well, I think that California has headwinds.
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.540]   I don't expect your market to plummet.
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:39.140]   It's not gonna fall apart.
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:41.320]   I think you've had, what, something like 2% growth
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.860]   in San Francisco this year, but many, many home values
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:46.860]   in California have increased by double digits
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:48.260]   across the state.
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:50.900]   California, a lot of people love it.
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.500]   It's a very strong market, and I think it's a strong market
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:54.420]   'cause there's a lot of wealthy people,
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.060]   and wealthy people are less susceptible
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:01.060]   to financial ups and downs than a lot of other people.
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:03.660]   And so I'm not scared of the market
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:04.820]   if the numbers can work.
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:07.520]   And so what I'd say is, I would just go house shopping,
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.620]   look at some stuff, and just go look
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.180]   and physically tour some houses.
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:17.140]   And you should have some sense of the rental market
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:20.380]   because you have been in the rental market.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:23.180]   Tour some houses that you think might work
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:26.100]   and get a sense of what's available for you,
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:29.260]   and then talk to some financing agents
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:30.620]   and talk to some mortgage brokers
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:32.420]   and see what options are available for you
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:34.740]   with financing in different scenarios.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.940]   And if you're gonna spend a few weeks doing that,
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:39.540]   you'll have a very good sense of whether those strategies
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.980]   will work in your area or not.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:46.040]   And so I've given you my answer for where to find the data,
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:50.140]   but I'll tell you that I think the data is interesting,
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.940]   but not that big of a deal for a scenario
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:54.000]   like you're describing.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   If you have dual income, no kids, saving plenty of money,
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.400]   you can probably finagle the financing.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.680]   If you get into it and you can put your tenants in place
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.240]   to help you do it, you're probably good to go.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:10.000]   And you should have enough wiggle room in your budget
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.500]   that if you have vacancies or unexpected expenses,
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:13.900]   you can just cash flow them.
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.640]   That's the advantage that high income,
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.760]   or that's the advantage that at least moderate income people
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.720]   have in the real estate space,
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:23.580]   is that you don't have to make everything from it.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.760]   And if you'll get in and start,
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.360]   if you'll get in and be an owner and a buyer,
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.400]   then you'll position yourself in a sense
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.760]   where things are actually gonna,
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.480]   you'll position yourself to where you can actually
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.820]   take advantage of what's happening.
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:40.400]   And even if you only got mortgage pay down,
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.600]   that's still benefit.
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.120]   You don't have to make the best deal out there.
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.880]   And again, telling you from hard won experience
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.460]   that I used to think I've gotta make the best deal
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.480]   because I went to real estate seminars and people said,
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.000]   "Oh, you make your money when you buy
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.320]   "and I gotta get the best deal."
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:56.600]   And so I thought, I gotta get the best deal,
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.840]   I gotta get the best deal.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.200]   And getting the best deal is exhausting sometimes.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.920]   And so I've since changed my opinion.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.920]   I've since said, you just gotta get a deal.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:05.480]   And then in time, you'll get better deals.
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.440]   And there's no question that you wanna get the best deal
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:10.880]   that you can, but sometimes the best deal that you can get
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.600]   might be just pay retail.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.120]   And in the strategy that you're describing,
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.800]   even paying retail is not bad.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:21.080]   It's not the best, but it's not bad.
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:26.080]   So go and shop and focus on taking action.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.560]   And if you get into it and you decide,
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.760]   "Hey, this doesn't work for me, we don't like this,"
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.400]   then sell the house and move on.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:36.960]   - Killer, thanks so much for that.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.760]   Appreciate it, that's all I have.
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.180]   - Cool, thanks man.
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:41.960]   - All right, Thomas, you said you had another question.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:42.800]   We'll do it.
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.640]   We'll wrap it up with your second question.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:45.480]   Go ahead, sir.
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:53.040]   - Hey, Joshua, thanks for taking the second question.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.280]   Actually kind of relates to the last one.
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:58.160]   I was, wanted to ask, I remember you talking about
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:01.080]   wanting to build a real estate portfolio in the past,
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.760]   and I just kind of wanted to know
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:05.400]   if that was still your plan and what type,
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.800]   what I guess area of real estate
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:10.180]   were you looking at doing?
[01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:15.420]   - My plans personally have been stymied
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:18.200]   by my sense of frustration
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.300]   with the United States of America
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:24.080]   and my wondering whether I want to divorce myself
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.220]   from that particular country
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:30.780]   or just go to counseling and go back into it.
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:33.540]   And so I left the United States
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:36.880]   basically almost three years ago.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.700]   And when I left the United States,
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:43.540]   I set out a plan to establish myself
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.880]   so that I didn't have to be connected
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.840]   to the future of the United States.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.240]   I was very concerned about the,
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:56.140]   I was very concerned about the long-term future
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:57.260]   of the country.
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:00.040]   I was very concerned about legal changes
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:05.040]   that would affect me, that would cause me moral troubles,
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:08.960]   just personal sense of my conscience
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:12.720]   and my own ethical ability to live with myself
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.880]   if I were involved with that country.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.840]   And just a concern about the fact
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:21.040]   that I hadn't really taken the measure of the world
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.740]   in a way that I should have,
[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:25.200]   that I basically, like most of us
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.000]   who grow up in the United States,
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.800]   that I was born and raised there
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.120]   and just seemed like the best place,
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.400]   and after all, we're the best country in the world.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:37.160]   And so I left with a goal of putting in place a plan B,
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:40.880]   the ability to not have to depend upon the United States.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:43.600]   And so over the last few years,
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:47.720]   I have systematically executed on that.
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.140]   So at this point in time,
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:53.040]   I could never go back to the United States
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.120]   the rest of my life.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:57.640]   I could divorce myself from the country.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.400]   I could renounce my citizenship,
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.960]   and I could live in several places around the world
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:06.460]   and have a very bright future without that.
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:09.620]   So what has been interesting to me along that journey
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:14.300]   is that I now,
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:18.580]   since I don't have to be in a relationship
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:19.500]   with the United States,
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:22.560]   I now feel much more peaceful and much more detached,
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:27.240]   and I can appreciate more objectively and dispassionately
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:32.240]   some of the good things about living in the United States
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:36.640]   in a way that I was blinded to previously
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.880]   by my frustrations with the country.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.040]   And so right now, I'm in the process
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.660]   of basically trying to decide,
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:50.240]   for let's say the next five years or so,
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.300]   five to 10 years,
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.780]   do I want to be involved with the United States or not?
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:35:00.980]   So along the way, I put most of my investment strategies
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:04.380]   on hold, especially with things like real estate.
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:09.540]   I don't own any real estate in the United States.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:13.340]   And what I have been questioning is,
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:16.800]   well, do I want to be involved in business
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.760]   in the United States?
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:20.680]   And by the way, I primarily want to be involved
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:24.200]   in investing in business, not in real estate.
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.340]   I think that real estate is great for a lot of people,
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:30.200]   but I would personally like to be involved in business.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.700]   I want to fix and flip businesses.
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:36.520]   And so that's something that I have interest in.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.300]   That's something that I believe I can build the skills to do
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:42.440]   and that's my primary plan,
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:46.400]   is not to be not real estate necessarily, but business.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:53.560]   But to answer your question is that I decided
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:58.560]   that these personal decisions were of a higher priority
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.680]   for me than buying houses and buying rental houses
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.520]   and things like that.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.680]   So I made the conscious choice to sit out
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:10.960]   and ignore the last few years of real estate.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:13.360]   So where I'm at right now is at the moment,
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.680]   I am traveling around the world
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.360]   and I am systematically trying to figure out,
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.840]   are some of the international options
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:25.800]   interesting to me enough for me to commit myself
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.400]   to not being in the United States?
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:32.160]   Or are the lifestyle considerations
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.640]   of everything being easy and simple and cheap
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:37.560]   and I know how it works enough to convince me
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.720]   to move back to the United States?
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.720]   So from a real estate perspective,
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:47.160]   I'd really like to go to Southeast Asia
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:52.160]   before I buy a house in the United States.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.760]   I'd really like to go and put boots on the ground
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:01.320]   and tour around Thailand and Malaysia and Cambodia
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:04.680]   and Vietnam and Taiwan and South Korea
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.900]   and look for opportunities and ask myself,
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:08.360]   are there opportunities here?
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:11.720]   Because I think there are a lot of opportunities.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.160]   I've spent a lot of time in Latin America.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.320]   I understand the markets there.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.480]   I see opportunities in some of those places,
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.320]   but I also don't see necessarily the same
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.240]   growing economies as Southeast Asia.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.720]   And so I'm trying to get myself to Southeast Asia
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:26.560]   to spend some time there.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.680]   Unfortunately, COVID has derailed my plans.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:35.800]   So just kind of an honest, long-winded way of saying
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.320]   that my issue right now is,
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.040]   do I want to have anything to do with the United States?
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:45.120]   At the moment, if you were to ask me a year ago,
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.940]   I think my answer would have been,
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:51.240]   I don't wanna go back.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.880]   I don't want anything to do with them.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:55.320]   I don't want them in my life.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.400]   I don't wanna go back.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.120]   Today, I think I'm softened on that.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:02.340]   And I talk, I think, almost every day,
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:05.840]   and I talk with my wife almost every other day,
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.120]   and I try to figure out, well, what do I want?
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.760]   And the biggest challenge here for me
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.160]   is simply my children.
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:16.240]   I've had a lot of freedom to kind of wander around
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:20.240]   because my children have been quite young,
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:23.120]   but my children are not as young as they were.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:28.040]   And so in order for me to have the kind of family life
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:30.840]   that I envision, I need to make
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.200]   some of these bigger decisions.
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.480]   And so I'm right in the middle of deciding that.
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:36.520]   So if I go back to the United States,
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:39.840]   then I will put in place a certain set of strategies.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:42.360]   If I stay out of the United States,
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:45.040]   I will pursue alternative strategies.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.000]   And basically, in my head,
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.120]   although I have no firm deadline,
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:52.200]   I'm really trying to come to some clarity
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.760]   on that personal question over, say,
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.840]   the next six months or so.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.240]   And that's the basic reason why I'm wandering
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:00.600]   around the world right now.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:05.600]   So obviously, it's not do or die.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.400]   You can change anything, right?
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.200]   That's one of the things that I have come to appreciate
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.520]   is I could move back to the United States
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.200]   and I could leave a year later,
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.840]   just like I could decide I don't wanna leave
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.480]   and I could be gone and I could change my mind
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.640]   a year from now.
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:20.640]   But I don't think for the wellbeing of my family,
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:25.400]   I think it's more important for me to make a clearer,
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:28.960]   give clearer direction where there's more consistency
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:31.840]   versus changing my mind all the time.
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:36.840]   And so since I have completed my comprehensive plan B,
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.120]   then I feel a lot better now.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:41.000]   And so right now, over the next six months,
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.760]   I'm personally trying to decide the answer to that question.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.920]   And then that will drive what I personally do
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:51.280]   with regard to future real estate and business activities.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.120]   That make sense?
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:56.920]   - Definitely.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.400]   Thanks for sharing, yeah.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.760]   Yeah, if you're willing to share,
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.200]   look forward to seeing what you find.
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:07.960]   I mean, I haven't been to all the Southeast Asian countries,
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.560]   but there are definitely some that,
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:12.120]   other ones that I wanna go to still.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:16.120]   Yeah, experiences thus far have been good.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.760]   - Yeah, it's obviously a totally different world.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.800]   But I mean, the numbers don't lie, right?
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:22.920]   If you wanna know where the economic growth is,
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:24.560]   the numbers are very obvious.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:27.480]   The economic growth is not in the West, right?
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:30.560]   The population growth is not in the West at the moment.
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:33.440]   The population growth is in the South.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:35.880]   The global South is where the population growth is.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.760]   The global South is where the economic growth
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.840]   the next couple of decades is going to be.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.920]   And so that's where the opportunities are.
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:48.680]   If I were 21 years old and single,
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:53.680]   I would be living in Ethiopia or in Bangkok
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.320]   or something like that.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.000]   Because that's where the action is going to be
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.760]   for the next few decades.
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.800]   I'm not 21 years old and I'm not single.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.520]   And so it's more complex for me
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:05.880]   to answer some of those other questions
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:08.080]   of where is the best place for my family to live?
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.080]   And that's a harder question.
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.160]   It goes pretty deep to try to figure that out
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:13.920]   'cause there's no rubric.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.360]   There's no manual for it.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:17.960]   In fact, I find it really overwhelming
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.280]   to try to think through, right?
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:21.080]   The reason most of us live where we live
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.400]   is because that's where we're from,
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.480]   that's where our family is,
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.400]   and/or that's where we have a job.
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.840]   And in my situation, I'm not currently living
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.200]   where I'm from, I'm not currently living
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.720]   where my family is, and my job can be done anywhere.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.880]   And so I thought that I wanted that freedom, right?
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.680]   It took me 15 years to build that freedom.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.800]   Well, then I got it, and now I just find myself
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:39.200]   totally overwhelmed 'cause I don't know
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:42.200]   whether I should live in Addis Ababa or Riyadh
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:45.920]   or Rio or anywhere, and it's too much.
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:48.480]   And so I've tried to approach it,
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:51.440]   but right now I'm trying to see it.
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:53.040]   And I just wish I'd seen more of the world
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.280]   when it was easier.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:58.440]   'Cause right now, because we have four young children,
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:01.240]   and I don't regret it, and I'm not complaining,
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.440]   but I cannot leave my wife at home
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.880]   with four young children and go bounce around the globe,
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.440]   say, "Oh, I'm gonna go bounce around the globe."
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.360]   That's just, it's not appropriate.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:12.880]   And so I'm bringing my wife and my children with me,
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:16.600]   but it just makes a different kind of travel experience
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:20.280]   and travel arrangement than the other opportunities.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:23.680]   And so at the moment, again, I got plans and opportunities,
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.240]   I think there's opportunity all over,
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.320]   but that's my answer is I don't know.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:30.600]   And so I'm mostly focused on trying
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:33.320]   to answer the question of where do I want to live,
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:35.480]   because I'm at a phase in my family life
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:37.680]   where that's the best thing I can do
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:39.760]   for the well-being of my family,
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:43.040]   which is the reason that I care about making money.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.800]   And then once I've decided that,
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.520]   then the constraints will be obvious
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.080]   and the proper personal investment plan
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.920]   into business and real estate and everything else
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:56.760]   will be obvious once I've made that decision.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.560]   And so I've given myself basically
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:04.400]   maybe six more months, and then I'll be somewhere
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:07.120]   and decided something.
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.340]   I just don't know the answer to that yet.
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:14.840]   - Great, thank you for the response.
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:18.080]   And may God bless you with the wisdom and discernment
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:20.800]   to do what's right with you and your family.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.560]   - I appreciate that more than you know,
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:26.440]   because it is a very significant issue, right?
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:31.200]   You feel the responsibility significantly,
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.600]   and I find it difficult to, again,
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:34.640]   there's no rule book, right?
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:37.400]   Most people don't think the way that I think,
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.480]   and it's fine, it's no big deal.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:40.720]   But most people don't look at the world
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:42.120]   the way that I look at it.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.880]   There's some who do, but it just leads to,
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:47.040]   it's kind of a, there are not a lot of people
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.840]   that you can ask for advice on it.
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:50.440]   There are not a lot of people who've done
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.280]   anywhere near the things that I've done.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.840]   And so it's hard to find those people
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.720]   that can be the trusted confidants
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.920]   who actually understand enough to give good advice,
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.200]   but we're working on it.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:02.080]   That's it for today's show.
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:05.960]   Thank you all so much for listening and for calling in.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:09.200]   It's been a great pleasure to have this conversation
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.440]   with you, I'd love to talk to you next week.
