[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.960]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.260]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.360]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.360]   and if you're even remotely interested in cruises,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.360]   this is going to be an amazing episode.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.040]   And spoiler alert, I'm recording this after the interview,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.080]   and I'll be honest, I was a little bit of a skeptic
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.020]   on cruises, and I am totally convinced
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.560]   and excited to go on one.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.720]   And who better to join me for this conversation
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.760]   than Emma Latisse, a cruise expert and content creator,
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.780]   to talk about every way you could optimize
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.080]   your cruising experience, we'll cover everything you need
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.660]   to know from the best destinations,
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.600]   picking the right operator, the right cabins,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.680]   different activities, and entertainment on board,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.400]   and even ways that you might be able to use
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.720]   cruise loyalty programs to snag the best,
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.440]   or even free deals.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.240]   Emma's been cruising since she was 11,
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.300]   has been on over 50 cruises, and has a wealth of knowledge
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.560]   on everything from luxury yachts to huge mega ships,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.160]   and getting great deals on everything.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.780]   I am so excited to have her on the show,
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.760]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.060]   - There is nothing better than finding a brand of clothing
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.680]   that's comfortable, functional, and looks good.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.280]   And that's exactly how I feel
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.400]   about our sponsor today, Viore.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.580]   If you saw me in person, you'd know I believe it,
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.560]   because there are very few days that go by
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.940]   where I'm not wearing one, two,
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.040]   or even three pieces of Viore.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.420]   They make performance apparel for men and women
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.120]   that's incredibly versatile.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.840]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.120]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.200]   And it is so comfortable, you'll wanna wear it all the time.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.400]   I've long said that Sunday performance joggers
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.200]   were my favorites, and don't get me wrong,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.760]   I have at least three pairs,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.980]   and they are the most comfortable pants I've owned.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.320]   But I've been running a lot more,
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.060]   and it's still warm in California,
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.960]   so I'm wearing my core shorts all the time.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.800]   Their products are incredibly versatile,
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.840]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.120]   but they're also great for lounging and running around town.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.880]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.200]   and for all the Hacks listeners,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.760]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.520]   Emma, thank you for being here.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.520]   - Thanks for having me, I'm excited.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.680]   - It's funny, when I think of travel traditionally,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.960]   and in the past with this show,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.160]   I think of flights, I think of cars and hotels,
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.960]   but cruises aren't usually in that top three,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.520]   but you have enough experience to make a case for it.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.760]   So I'm curious if you can make a case for cruises
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.640]   that people maybe haven't heard or might be neglecting.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.320]   - Okay, so I think for me,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.840]   one of my favorite things about cruising
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.680]   is it makes travel so much easier.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.080]   Like you say, you're used to talking
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.800]   about hotels and flights.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.720]   Often if you book a cruise, you book one thing,
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.360]   you pay once, and that is it.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.320]   For a week, for two weeks, it's like being looked after,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.920]   and it's a really good way to sort of get an insight
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.080]   into different countries.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.360]   You can go on a cruise and visit
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.000]   five different countries in a week,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.080]   which if you were going to do that on land,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.360]   that requires a lot of planning, and that's quite hard.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.360]   - Do you feel like you get time in those countries
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.600]   to really see them, or is it usually you're there
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.280]   for five hours and you kind of just get
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.600]   a little quick glimpse?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.440]   - It does depend.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.280]   I mean, it's quite common to have two days in a port.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.360]   I've done three days in a row in port.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.320]   I often go back to places that I've visited on a cruise,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.120]   and you can find out within a day
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.960]   whether you want to spend more time there,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.520]   or if you don't want to go back there.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.960]   So it's quite nice for that.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.360]   - When did this whole cruise passion begin for you?
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.760]   - So I was 11 when I took my first cruise.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.240]   That was not my deciding.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.880]   That was a big family cruise,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.480]   and from that moment, I was hooked.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.760]   The things that I liked about it when I was 11
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.120]   are very different to the things I like now.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.080]   You know, for me at 11, I had so much more freedom
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.800]   than I had in my regular life.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.320]   I was on there with my cousins,
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.960]   so my parents might want to do a formal sit-down dinner,
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.280]   and me and my cousins could run off and go to the buffet.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.360]   And for me, to get pizza in the buffet by myself at 11,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.000]   I got to go to the kids' clubs.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.400]   I would think I was so cool.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.800]   I had American friends, Australian friends,
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.280]   and it was just so much fun.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.120]   - It's funny.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.000]   I decided that I really wanted to go to boarding school
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.240]   for a lot of the same reasons.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.080]   - Really?
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.520]   - It seems like a much different proposition.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.920]   You could just do it for a couple of weeks,
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.600]   but I wanted the freedom to be able to do things
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.000]   and go over without having to ask for rides for my parents.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.200]   But this is not a conversation about boarding school.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.520]   For people who are unfamiliar,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.600]   I wonder if we could try to set the landscape of cruising,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.960]   because some people might think,
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.560]   "Oh, it's just these massive carnival cruise ships
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.880]   "that go to the Bahamas."
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.720]   So how do you think about different types of lines
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.400]   and ships, but then maybe next,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.720]   after we can talk about the kind of destinations
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.160]   and lengths and that kind of stuff?
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.440]   - It's really interesting to hear you say carnival cruises,
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.960]   the thing that comes to mind.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.080]   'Cause when I speak to someone from the UK,
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.000]   the first thought that they have is,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.640]   "Oh, cruises are really boring.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.680]   "They're for old people.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.040]   "They're very traditional."
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.040]   Whereas in the US, it's seen much more as a party thing.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.880]   And both of those things are true.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.000]   I'm not saying they're not true,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.720]   but there is everything in between.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.520]   So there's a couple of big American cruise lines,
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.760]   which are probably the ones that people would recognize.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.040]   They're the ones that tend to be
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.800]   more sort of family focused,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.040]   but there's also many, many more luxurious cruise lines.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.920]   And there's so much in between.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.640]   I mean, I've done cruises with as few as 19 guests on board
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.880]   on tiny ships.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.240]   And then all the way up to 6,500 guests,
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.040]   I think is the biggest ship I've been on.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.160]   So if you're someone who wants to,
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.560]   just sit by the pool with a book and eat good food
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.480]   and enjoy drinks that are brought to you,
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.280]   there's so many cruise lines that do that.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.320]   And if you're somebody who wants to do,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.280]   I've done skydiving simulators, surf simulators, zip lines.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.120]   If you want all of that adrenaline filled stuff,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.960]   that's there too.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.400]   But there's just so much variety,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.800]   I think within the cruise industry.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.160]   I don't think I've ever found anybody
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.720]   who I've not thought you would suit that one.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.040]   - Maybe some examples that people want some inspiration.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.160]   What are a few other kind of brands
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.320]   that if someone wanted to just quickly look online
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.520]   to understand kind of a little more
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.800]   down what you're talking about?
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.400]   - The main ones are Royal Caribbean,
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.880]   Norwegian and Carnival.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.000]   They're sort of the biggest ones.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.480]   You'll probably recognize those.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.520]   We also have a lot of British cruise lines.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.000]   That's a different conversation.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And there's also a lot of European cruise lines
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.800]   that I don't think people should ignore.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.200]   I think it's nice if you're gonna go to Italy
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.920]   to cruise with an Italian cruise line
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.800]   where everybody on board is Italian.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.720]   I find that really fun.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.920]   I know it's not for everybody, but I really enjoy it.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.800]   And there's a lot of sort of smaller,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   more adult cruise lines.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.760]   If you wanted to do a cruise with a cruise line
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.200]   like Princess, Holland America, Celebrity,
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.360]   you won't find as many children on board,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.880]   but you'll find very good food, very good service.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.040]   They all have theater shows every day.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.920]   For me, if I think about what my ideal day is,
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.600]   it involves lots of eating out.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.400]   It involves live music, maybe involves going for a swim.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.920]   All of that stuff is on a cruise.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.640]   So there are some more quirky cruise lines
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.960]   if you're interested in doing
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.640]   a very spontaneous adult cruise.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.640]   Virgin just started a cruise line,
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.720]   so there's just so much in there.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.120]   - So in my mind, it's like, oh, it's a family thing, right?
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.960]   There's kids running around.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.560]   You just said some of them are adult only.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.000]   Do you think that works at every tier?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.200]   Are there places that people should focus on
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.960]   if you're younger versus older?
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.480]   Want kids, don't want kids?
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.040]   How do you think about it from that perspective?
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.760]   - I would say generally the cheaper the cruise is,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.400]   the more kids you're gonna get on there
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.240]   because you get a lot of discounted
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.640]   third and fourth passenger places.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.000]   So when you have a cabin,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.920]   often they'll hold three or four people,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.320]   but in reality, normally you'll only have two in there
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.880]   'cause they have sort of bunk beds.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.080]   Normally four adults wouldn't share a cabin.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.800]   If you go on the cheaper end,
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.680]   sometimes, you know, I cruised recently with my family
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.000]   and the children were 49 pounds,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.120]   which is about $60 for 13 nights.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.120]   So if you do go down to the budget end,
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.960]   obviously you're gonna fill those spaces with children.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.040]   When you get a bit more luxurious,
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.960]   and I would say a ship with around 1,000 or less,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.960]   I would class as a small cruise ship now.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.760]   I know it sounds a lot, 1,000 people,
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.320]   but on those ones, they tend to be a bit more expensive
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.680]   and they tend to be a bit more adult focused.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.040]   Not that children, they can still go on some of these,
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.960]   but they tend to be a bit more adult.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.280]   - And what's that price range, right?
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.000]   You said obviously at the low end,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.840]   but if someone's thinking about a cruise
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.080]   at the highest level,
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.320]   you're spending from what to what per night?
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.160]   - For me personally,
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.320]   I'm gonna try and translate into dollars in my head.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.360]   For me, my sort of happy space
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.200]   would be around $150 per person per night.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.080]   That's where I'm happy.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.840]   A mainstream cruise line, you can do that.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.400]   If you're gonna do something like a river cruise,
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.240]   they can be $500 per person per night.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.320]   You could do $1,000 per person per night
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.720]   if you wanted to do that.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.920]   And I think the cheapest I've done was around $50.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.320]   So from 50 to 1,000, anywhere in that range.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.280]   - Well, we're gonna talk about getting deals in a bit,
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.440]   but one thing I'll share for inspiration,
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.720]   a friend of mine, Ramit Sethi,
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.800]   went on this amazing, beautiful cruise.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.560]   So if people wanna see the other side
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.920]   of high-end, beautiful,
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.320]   there's this cruise in Japan
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.760]   and it's like a floating hotel
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.120]   and the website's gone to guntu.jp.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.760]   I don't know if you've seen this one before,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.720]   but I just want for people who wanna go online
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.720]   and look at that other end of cruising
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.400]   that doesn't look a thing like a giant cruise ship
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.880]   with the most beautiful food and hospitality.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.920]   That's just something to kind of wet people's palate.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.040]   Let's talk about where, right?
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.520]   Are there major regions for cruising?
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.160]   I assume you could probably cruise anywhere,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.680]   but are there kind of really common destinations?
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.640]   - So the main ones out of the US,
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.680]   obviously Alaska, Hawaii, the Caribbean,
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.160]   and sort of cruising out of New York.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.520]   Those ones are very, very popular.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.680]   Cruising over here in Europe,
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   we have a lot of Mediterranean cruises.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.160]   Great for us in winter when it's a bit dark
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.240]   and a bit rainy in the UK,
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.040]   we can go to somewhere like Barcelona in two hours
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.360]   and get much better weather.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.000]   There's also a lot of sort of Norway cruises around here.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.640]   I like to think of Norway as our version of Alaska,
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.040]   but you can cruise across the Atlantic if you want.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.720]   You can cruise across the Pacific.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.040]   I just got back from a cruise that went to Japan,
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.600]   which was absolutely incredible.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.960]   And then we have cruises that are around Australia.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.440]   So yeah, pretty much anywhere where there's ocean,
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.320]   there are cruises.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.520]   Cruises in the Middle East are becoming quite popular now.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.520]   I haven't done that yet,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.080]   but it probably would be easier to say where cruises aren't.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.000]   'Cause I mean, you can cruise to Antarctica
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.840]   if you have the budget for it.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.520]   - Yeah, that would be one at the higher end.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.800]   How many cruises have you been on?
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.360]   - I'm on 61 cruises, which I know sounds bonkers and it is,
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.600]   but that's counting every single, you know,
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.440]   I've done some very big ferries, river cruises.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.040]   I've done some press launches.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.560]   I did one cruise that was canceled after four hours
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.040]   and they canceled it while we were at dinner
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.880]   and we had to go home.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.120]   And I'm still counting that 'cause I unpack.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.320]   So that's absolutely every day.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.160]   - Okay.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.960]   When I first heard about Green Chef, our sponsor today,
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.440]   I told my wife, Amy, that we should try it out.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.400]   And she immediately said no,
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.160]   because the few times we've tried meal kits in the past,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.680]   it just didn't work out.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.440]   What had me excited was that Green Chef was focused
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.800]   on eating well and flavorful dishes
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.720]   instead of just trying to be the cheapest way to make dinner,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.920]   though it turns out it's still a much better deal
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.760]   than ordering out.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.200]   So we found an awesome deal to try it out,
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.160]   like the one I'll share with you, and the rest was history.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.000]   We've now been doing Green Chef for the past seven months
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.440]   and had well over 50 Green Chef meals.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.160]   And after such a great experience,
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.240]   I reached out to the company
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.800]   to see if they'd become a sponsor,
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.640]   which as you can see, they decided to do,
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.480]   because I think it's one of the easiest ways to eat clean
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.920]   and align your food with whatever wellness goals you have,
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.080]   but without skimping on flavor.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.720]   Each week, you can pick from over 80 chef-crafted,
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.320]   nutritionist-approved recipes,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.760]   featuring fresh ingredients
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.720]   like organic fruits and vegetables,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.800]   and sustainably sourced seafood.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.840]   So if any of this resonates with you,
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.120]   including my wife's initial objections,
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.560]   you should absolutely give Green Chef a try,
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.760]   and we have an awesome deal for you as well.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.400]   Com, go to allthehacks.com/greenchef,

[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.400]   We have a holiday tradition
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.440]   of making homemade pasta with the family,
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.960]   and I'm so excited to level
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.720]   that whole experience up this year
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.280]   after taking the Making Perfect Pasta class
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.280]   on Masterclass, who I'm excited
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.840]   to be partnering with today.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.640]   Masterclass makes a meaningful gift
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.920]   this season for you and anyone on your list,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.160]   because both of you can learn from the best
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.440]   to become your best, from leadership
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.880]   to effective communication to cooking.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.080]   Whether you're watching Masterclass on TV,
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.080]   listening on audio mode in the app,
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.120]   or on their site, the quality speaks for itself.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.840]   It's like Masterclass instructors
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.640]   are your own personal mentors
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.760]   that are gonna help you reach the next level.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.840]   And just thinking about how much it would cost
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.200]   to take one-on-one classes
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.480]   from the world's best is crazy,
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.120]   but Masterclass membership starts
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.720]   at just $120 a year for unlimited access
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.900]   to over 180 one-on-one classes,
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.100]   with new ones added every month,
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.720]   like the Science of Better Sleep with Matt Walker,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   that's helped me sleep better every single night.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.360]   Boost your confidence and find practical takeaways
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.060]   you can apply to your life and work.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.800]   This holiday season, give one annual membership
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.720]   and get one free at allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.580]   Right now, you can get two memberships
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.920]   for the price of one at allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.400]   That's allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.240]   Offer terms apply.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.120]   And I guess I forgot to ask,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.800]   how would you, as someone trying to look at cruises,
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.720]   what are some of the evaluation criteria
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.920]   they should use comparing different cruise lines?
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.200]   Are there things you would look at
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.220]   that maybe I wouldn't think to look at,
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.800]   other than pictures of a boat?
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.440]   Yes, you need to find a cruise line
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.880]   that suits you in terms of how busy it's gonna be.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.320]   Some people like to be entertained all the time.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.000]   They like to have diving shows, ice skating.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.400]   There's cruise lines that do that.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.040]   Some people have no interest in that.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.700]   So there's no point booking a cruise ship
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.080]   that has a go-kart track taking up a third of the top deck
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.740]   if you're someone who doesn't wanna do that.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.320]   Some cruise lines do still have dress codes.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.080]   And I know a lot of people find it really weird
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.480]   to be told what to wear.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.000]   Not all cruise lines do that,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.800]   but that's something I would definitely research
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.760]   before booking, 'cause you don't wanna show up
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.960]   and then it's just not what you planned.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.200]   And you mentioned 61.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.360]   Are there some favorite highlights of cruises that you say,
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.980]   if you're just looking to do this for the first time,
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.880]   here are two or the three of the best ones I've done?
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.040]   If someone came to me and they said,
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.640]   "I'm gonna only do one cruise in my entire life,"
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.760]   which cruise should it be?
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.680]   It is Singapore to Tokyo,
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.120]   because it is absolutely unlike anything.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.720]   Every place I went to was so interesting.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.440]   And I think traveling in Asia by cruise ship
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.320]   is a lot easier because you know where you're gonna sleep.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.680]   You know what your food's gonna be.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.000]   You can go out and be adventurous during the day
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.320]   and then you still have your sort of comfort zone
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.520]   that comes round with you.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.920]   So I really like that.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.440]   If someone's coming to me
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.280]   and they're thinking of a first cruise in Europe,
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.780]   I normally say a seven day Mediterranean cruise.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.280]   I think that's long enough to give you a taste of it.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.680]   And you can see a lot of places in seven days.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.600]   If you're in the US,
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.520]   the most popular first cruise is a Caribbean cruise,
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.360]   which is not my favorite.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.040]   I feel like it's very man-made.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.560]   A lot of the cruise ports,
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.200]   they're designed for cruise ships,
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.920]   but it'll give you a taste of,
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.540]   are you happy to be on a ship?
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.840]   Some people find it really weird that they look out
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.720]   and there's just sea in every direction.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.480]   And you only need one day on board
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.160]   to find out if you like that or not.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.840]   - Where would you suggest someone start
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.440]   if they're thinking, "I wanna go on a cruise.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.540]   "Do I pick the line and then look at the places
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.760]   "or do I pick the place and then look at the lines?"
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.640]   - What I do is I look overall at a place.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.040]   So I may say, "I really want to go to Norway."
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.800]   And then I will have a look within that.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.840]   I think if you go very specific
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.860]   and you say, "I really want to visit this port,"
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.300]   there may only be one cruise line
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.620]   or one ship that does that.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.920]   So I like to start roughly with the destination,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.240]   Mediterranean, Norway.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.440]   When do I want to go?
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.840]   That makes a big difference.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.500]   Most of our cruise ships move from places like Norway
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.080]   down to the Caribbean in winter
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.600]   because the sun goes down to the Caribbean
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.980]   and no one really wants to go around Norway in the dark.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.500]   So that makes a big difference.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.520]   But have a look roughly.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.360]   Do you wanna go in summer?
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.400]   Do you wanna go in winter?
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.080]   What is the rough destination?
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.560]   And then you'll probably find,
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.880]   I mean, there's a lot of cruise lines.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.720]   There's a lot of cruise ships.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.160]   You have five or six different cruise lines
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.360]   you can pick from within.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.240]   - And is there some website that has all the destinations,
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.400]   all the ships, all the lines
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.320]   to make it easy to figure this out?
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.360]   - There's many, many, many, of course.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.080]   But the one that I like to use
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.640]   just because it's very simple,
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.880]   it's literally a list of where the cruises are going,
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.120]   is an American website.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.700]   It's called Vacations to Go.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.680]   And you're probably more used to this than me
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.760]   'cause it's an American website.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.960]   It doesn't include the fees and the taxes
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.360]   and the port charges and stuff.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.720]   So the price is probably not
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.680]   what you're actually gonna pay,
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.480]   but it gives you a really good idea of what is where,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.320]   which can be quite hard to work out.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.800]   'Cause obviously if you go to a cruise line,
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.080]   they're gonna say,
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.360]   you're not gonna go to Royal Caribbean.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.960]   And they say, nah, go with another cruise line.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.200]   But this is just a big list.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.480]   It's quite a simple website.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.520]   That's where I start.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.560]   I do not book through Vacations to Go.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.400]   I'm from the UK,
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.920]   but it gives me an idea of what is where.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.500]   - So let's talk about this.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.920]   You're gonna search, narrow down your list,
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.340]   do some homework to understand what's on board
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.040]   and what the rooms are like.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.400]   Then where are you going to actually book it
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.360]   and find the best deals?
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.480]   - So it's a little bit different in the UK and the US,
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.880]   but the thing that is similar
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.640]   is we have many, many big travel agencies
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.560]   and there's many independent agents.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.520]   So I use a specific person to book my cruises
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.440]   who's part of a big travel agency,
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.040]   rather than just booking online with a big company.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.120]   And I like that because when things go wrong,
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.320]   you can literally just phone that one person
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.960]   and say, my flight is canceled.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.200]   Can you sort this out?
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   Obviously in 2020, that was not a great year for cruising.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.700]   It shut down completely.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.920]   We spent a lot of time fixing things
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.600]   for people who'd booked through the really big agencies
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.520]   that sell them cheap because no one could get through.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.480]   So I think if you can find someone who knows you
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.080]   and trusts you, and once you've booked a few cruises,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.980]   they'll know what you like.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.080]   My agent messages me all the time.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.520]   She sends me a link and it's like,
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.280]   Emma, this one made me think of you.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.500]   More often than not, she's right and I book it.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.280]   So I normally do recommend,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.060]   if you can get to know one person,
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.120]   I think it's easier than just a big company.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.240]   But I've booked cruises every single way over the years
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.920]   with some success and some less.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.320]   - Is the price the same everywhere?
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.760]   Are there deals to be had?
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.680]   - The price that a travel agent would give you
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.000]   would never be more than booking it direct
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   'cause the money comes from the cruise line.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.480]   If you're gonna book a cruise direct
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.480]   on the cruise line's website,
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.360]   they're just keeping that money themselves.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.200]   So the travel agents don't charge anything.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.320]   You either basically give the money to a travel agent
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.600]   or you give it to the cruise line.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.080]   The way I see it is I might as well have free help,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.880]   to be honest, but it's up to you.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.940]   There's certain things.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.140]   We have some supermarkets in the UK.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.540]   You can get certain points for shopping,
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.180]   like grocery shopping, and you can only use those direct.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.020]   There's some sort of cashback sites
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.220]   where you can get a little bit.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.780]   You know, when I go on a cruise with my YouTube channel,
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.580]   a cruise line will often say we'll give $100 on board credit
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.420]   to the first hundred people who book mentioning me.
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.340]   So sometimes they'll have extra stuff.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.540]   If a travel agent is trying to charge someone extra
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.980]   for a cruise, something's gone wrong and they should leave.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.900]   - Okay, and what about some of those extras
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.460]   or discounts or promotions?
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.000]   Are there best times to book a cruise to get a deal?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.920]   Is it last minute, far in advance?
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.960]   - So if you're someone who can plan something
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.880]   three years in advance, that's great.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.360]   And you can get a very, very good deal
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.040]   as soon as a new ship or a new itinerary is launched.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.280]   I'm not someone who can,
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.960]   I just can't plan three years in advance.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.560]   I have no idea what I'm gonna be doing.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.680]   So the next best time is normally between
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.800]   60 to 90 days before the cruise,
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.180]   because everyone else who booked it
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.360]   two or three years in advance,
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.200]   they have to pay normally 60 or 90 days before.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.260]   So some people don't pay
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.220]   and they know how many cabins they have left to fill.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.220]   So at that point, two months out, they might say,
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.460]   "Oh, all these people dropped out.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.500]   "We've got all these rooms."
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.540]   And that's normally when the price will come down.
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.660]   I do tell people if there's a specific cruise
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.780]   you really wanna do, don't wait
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.260]   and assume that you're gonna be able to book it
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.420]   'cause they do sell out.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.620]   So the best thing you can do if you wanna get a deal,
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.020]   keep a week off work in your calendar if you're not fussy,
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.820]   and then you can see which cruise lines
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.820]   you can book last minute.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.460]   - What if you wait even more last minute?
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.180]   Are there deals to be had if you book next week?
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.520]   - You normally have to do it at least two days in advance now
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.160]   just 'cause they have to put all the paperwork
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.000]   and everything through,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.760]   but you just may end up with something,
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.600]   say you want the cheapest cabin,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.520]   now only the suites are available or something last minute,
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.080]   which is not the worst problem to have,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.000]   but you have to be very flexible, I think,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.400]   to book very last minute.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.040]   - And what about things like points or loyalty programs?
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.760]   How did those factor into all of this?
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.300]   - So some cruise lines do have their own credit cards
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.360]   where if you spend money with that company,
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.960]   you'll get points, you can use them.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.640]   I don't normally recommend that
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.420]   'cause I'm not very cruise line loyal,
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.960]   and I think a lot of people think,
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.680]   I have the Royal Caribbean credit card,
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.640]   it makes most sense for me
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.320]   only to book Royal Caribbean cruises,
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.560]   and they don't look at one
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.600]   that they would enjoy just as much and is half price.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.080]   So that's what I think.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.600]   Some people absolutely love it.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.560]   One way that people get a lot of sort of,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.680]   they're called free cruises,
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.800]   I don't think they're free, is through the casino.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.640]   You can get points if you spend enough in the casino,
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.780]   they won't send you back, that's quite common.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.760]   Again, not something that I would do,
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.680]   but if you're booking a cruise,
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.340]   you can stick it on an Amex card.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.400]   If you're doing your flights,
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.220]   you can use your normal points for that.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.360]   There's nothing really that you can't do with a cruise
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.560]   that you would do if you're flying,
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.960]   and normally I'll stay in a hotel the night before.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.200]   - There is one deal that I went deep on a few weeks ago,
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.960]   and it's that because there are casinos on cruises
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.280]   and they make money, not as much as I thought,
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.120]   I'd originally thought like,
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.420]   "Wow, maybe they make all that money."
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.360]   I just looked before this,
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.560]   about two thirds of cruise revenue is from tickets,
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.560]   and about one third of it is on board.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.560]   And of that on board, there's food, there's drink,
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.940]   and we'll talk about some of those costs.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.800]   But of that, a big piece is casino.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.760]   And so if you go to a casino a lot in the US
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.820]   and you spend a lot of money,
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.920]   a lot of these casinos like Caesars have rewards programs.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.640]   And if you have status,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.960]   which basically comes from spending money
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.680]   in a lot of these rewards programs,
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.400]   well, then you're able to show that status
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.860]   to some cruise lines and say,
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.160]   "Hey, Carnival," or, "Hey, Royal Caribbean,
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.800]   I have status on all of these casinos."
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.920]   Well, I'm guessing most of the people listening here,
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.620]   maybe I'm wrong, don't spend a lot of money gambling.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.480]   And so that's probably not going to be as lucrative.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.180]   However, there are some ways to get status at casinos
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.880]   without actually gambling.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.960]   And so I think that is the trick.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.780]   So one is that if you have the,
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.660]   and I don't think there's a version of this in the UK,
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.620]   but the Wyndham earner business credit card,
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.140]   which is a credit card for Wyndham Rewards,
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.260]   which is a hotel chain,
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.160]   that gives you free Caesar's Diamond status,
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.320]   which is enough to get you a free cruise.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.040]   There's also Founder's Card, which is a program.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.600]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.440]   I don't want to endorse all the benefits
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.800]   because it's quite expensive.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.960]   It's like now it's $595.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   I signed up for Founder's Card many years ago
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.100]   and have locked myself into a lower rate.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.720]   I'll put my referral link in the show notes
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.560]   if people want to check it out.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.880]   But that also gets you Caesar's Diamond status.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.120]   And so once you get Caesar's Diamond status
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.160]   or MGM Gold status, then you can use that.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.540]   And there's all these, you know,
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.740]   I'll put a link to an article that went way deeper
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.740]   than we'll go today.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.580]   But it's like, you know,
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.660]   you want to target this cruise line first
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.580]   because I think Holland America owns Carnival
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.700]   or Royal Caribbean?
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.540]   - Other way around.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.940]   Carnival owns almost everything.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.780]   - Okay.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.780]   So it was, there was a sequence where it's like,
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.600]   if you try to use your free cruise
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.540]   on one of the cruise lines that's part of a conglomerate,
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.620]   they look, have you spent money on the other ones,
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.900]   but only in one way.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.500]   So it's like, you can use your status
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.460]   to get like a free Holland America cruise.
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.680]   And then after that you want to do Carnival or vice versa.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.960]   And you could basically kind of sequence it out
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.460]   to get three or four free.
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.560]   And I'm using air quotes here, cruises.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.480]   We'll talk in a second about how they're not always free.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.560]   But if you want to go down the rabbit hole of free cruises,
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.240]   getting yourself some casino status can often unlock a few.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.160]   And people say, don't take your first offer
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.400]   because you'll get an email from Carnival.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.520]   That's like, oh, do you want a free three-day Bahamas cruise?
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.280]   And then you wait a month and now you want a free seven day.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.720]   Do you want a free seven day with a balcony?
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.720]   And it goes on and on.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.480]   So I'll put a link to an awesome article
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.080]   from the Frequent Miler blog that goes deep on this.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.000]   I am currently, because I have this Caesars Diamond status,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.160]   I'm about to try this out, except my Caesars,
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.560]   I matched Caesars Diamond seven years ago.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.600]   And my account has been on inactive.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.640]   The only way to reactivate it is in the casino.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.640]   And so I cannot currently explore this
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.840]   until I go physically in person to a Caesars Casino.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   And I just haven't, since going down this rabbit hole,
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.440]   haven't been to a Caesars Casino, which there are many of,
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.760]   but there are not many of in, you know, nearby.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.800]   So that's my little tangent on going down free cruises.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.160]   But talk to me for a second about
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.760]   why they're not necessarily free, these kind of offers.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.920]   Because I think there's more that goes into the cost
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.040]   of a cruise than just the ticket.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.320]   - Yeah, so if you get a free cruise through a casino bug,
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.160]   it will not include taxes.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.800]   It won't include port fees.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.640]   And sometimes those things can cost more
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.520]   than the other part of the cruise fare.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.440]   In the UK, we don't see it split out.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.600]   We just see the price.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.880]   But in the US, it's sort of a very low,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.200]   you know, 399 plus 300 in fees.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.040]   So you could end up spending more on that cruise
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.040]   just 'cause you think you're getting a free cruise
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.080]   than you would spend on a whole cruise anyway,
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.760]   if you were just looking at a different cruise line
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.600]   that had some sort of sale or something.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.560]   So I think some people do get very happy
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.480]   that they got a free cruise, but it's not necessarily.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.600]   If it's something you want to do, fantastic.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.640]   It's a good discount.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.960]   It's a really good discount,
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.600]   but perhaps don't just blindly sort of follow it
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.160]   and think it's fantastic.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.320]   - And some of these, you know,
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.360]   I was reading through this article.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.520]   Some of them actually were really, really great deals,
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.360]   but you're right.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.440]   Some of them are not quite as great as they seem.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.840]   - Yeah, it sort of goes back to what you said,
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.040]   that we're going to talk about other expenses,
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.200]   but most of the American cruise lines,
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.800]   they add on like a automatic tip gratuity every day,
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.480]   which can be $15 a day.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.840]   So if you're getting a free cruise,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.880]   but then there's say two of you in the room
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.640]   and then you're doing two times 15 times,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.040]   it adds up quite fast.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.040]   - Yeah, what are some of the other costs?
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.080]   I'm sure the port fees and the taxes
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.840]   and even the gratuities are kind of things
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.040]   that are disclosed,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.440]   but maybe not included in the marketed price.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.720]   But once you're on board, you did mention earlier,
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.000]   like the great thing about cruises,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.040]   it's kind of, it's all there.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.000]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.800]   Surely there are things on that cruise
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   that also cost money.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.080]   - Yeah, if you want to spend money,
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.680]   you can spend more than your cruise fare easily.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.360]   But what I normally do is, cruises don't include drinks.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.560]   That's one of the big things.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.120]   They'll include like water, tea, coffee,
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.880]   but normally people want to drink soda.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.200]   You want to drink alcohol
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.640]   and you can either just pay like as if you're in a bar
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.240]   or you can get a drinks package.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.240]   So a drinks package would basically be you saying
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.080]   to the cruise line,
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.160]   I'll give you $30 a day and you'll give me unlimited.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.040]   And they're sort of thinking
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.240]   you won't get the money's worth,
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.680]   but you're thinking I'm gonna drink more than that.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.040]   So I normally get a non-alcoholic one.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.440]   Some of them are very expensive
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.000]   and I think I would be constantly chasing,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.520]   trying to get my money back.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.960]   But the main things that I sort of pay for on a cruise
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.680]   would be some drinks.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.960]   Wi-Fi is not normally included, is on some luxury lines,
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.440]   but I work from cruise ships now,
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.200]   so I need to pay for Wi-Fi.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.720]   And people do spend a lot of money
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.160]   on cruise line excursions in the ports.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.920]   I don't, I think I'm a bit more sort of confident
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.200]   doing my own thing than a lot of other cruisers,
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.440]   but I'm quite happy to get off.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.440]   You don't ever have to do a trip with the cruise line.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.960]   You can wander off by yourself.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.960]   You can order something online.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.120]   You can buy your ticket to the aquarium
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.080]   or wherever you're going.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.200]   But the cruise lines do charge an awful lot,
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.360]   I think, for their included trips.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.720]   If you're someone who's a bit nervous,
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.160]   like I did some excursions when I was in Asia
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.240]   because I thought I have one day in Vietnam.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.040]   I want to sort of make the most out of it,
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.480]   but they can be, especially with the American cruise lines,
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.280]   you can pay $150 a day,
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.640]   which that's what I like to pay for the cruise, so.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.840]   - And Wi-Fi, is internet connectivity
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.000]   pretty easy on a cruise?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.920]   Is it reliable?
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.640]   Could someone actually work while they're,
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.680]   I mean, you do, I guess.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.760]   - I do, but if I still had my old job,
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.120]   I would not have lasted.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.200]   I would have been in big trouble
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.120]   because it can be really good and it can be really bad.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.880]   And there's so many things that affect it.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.000]   If you're thinking you're a ship
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.920]   and you're sailing between a fjord,
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.120]   there's massive things,
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.200]   there's massive rocks in the way of everything.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.960]   If you hit bad weather, it can knock out the internet.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.280]   So it can be good, but it depends on your boss.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.720]   You know, for me, if I couldn't get on the course,
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.400]   if I had my old job before I worked for myself,
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.720]   I would have been in big trouble.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.200]   - And what about just kind of like wireless reliability?
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.000]   Is there cell reception
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.720]   when you're cruising between ports?
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.680]   - So as you sail away, what I normally say to people,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.520]   if they're nervous,
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.400]   they need to just put their phone in airplane mode
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.280]   and not mess around with the internet
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.360]   because you will connect to like a maritime network
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.560]   when you're out in the ocean.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.360]   And that can be very, very expensive.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.320]   I've heard horror stories of people who thought, right,
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.760]   I'll just put my phone in the safe
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.800]   and it's connected in the middle of the night
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.640]   and it's racked them up a massive bill.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.480]   So what I like to do, it's a bit different for me now.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.800]   I kind of need to stay connected,
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.680]   but if I didn't work in the cruise industry,
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   I would be putting my phone on airplane mode
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.240]   when I sailed away in the evening.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.080]   Normally you sail away sort of 6 p.m.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.200]   and I would be enjoying an evening without internet.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.480]   I think it's quite nice.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.760]   But yeah, when you're in port, if you have roaming,
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.880]   I have worldwide roaming on my phone plan.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.120]   You can use it like normal.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.360]   If you're sailing and you're near to the land, it's okay,
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.720]   but I would recommend going into the settings
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.600]   and making sure your phone will ask
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.120]   before it changes network.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.240]   I know not everyone likes to sort of do that,
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.960]   but if you're confident, you can just make it
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.800]   not connect to maritime and you'll be fine.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.640]   - Okay, perfect.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.520]   And what about on board?
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.280]   All these activities, the go-karts, the shows,
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.720]   all of that is included?
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.040]   Or are there some activities that cost extra?
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.000]   - It does depend on the cruise line, of course.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.360]   Normally everything in the theater is included.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.960]   You'll have live music included.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.680]   There'll be trivia, game shows, dance classes,
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.240]   that kind of stuff that's included.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.280]   The one with the go-karts, the go-karts do cost extra,
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.440]   but that is because that ship holds
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.800]   thousands and thousands of people.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.080]   And if they were free, no one would ever get a go,
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.480]   I don't think.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.120]   So there's a few things like that.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.760]   Generally speaking, I don't normally spend extra
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.200]   on entertainment on a cruise.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.080]   I really don't think I'd need to.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.040]   But yeah, you see water slides, you see pools,
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.720]   everything like that is included.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.160]   - What a ride.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.000]   Am I right?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.640]   It has been an eventful few years with two kids
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.880]   with constant reminders of how uncertain life can be.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.640]   Having quality term life insurance
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.240]   can help put your mind at ease
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.600]   knowing that your family is taken care of.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.440]   If something unexpected happens.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.520]   So definitely check out our sponsor today,

[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.800]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.240]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.080]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage

[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.640]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.200]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.800]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.480]   And even if you've already filed,
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.800]   being proactive right now to lower your future liability
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.160]   is so important.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.720]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.120]   I feel like I finally have a partner I can trust
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.440]   to handle everything for my personal and business taxes.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.000]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.880]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.240]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.840]   that gives you personalized guidance
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.120]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings,
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.000]   but also it's so easy to communicate with them.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.320]   There's an in-house team of expert CPAs
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.560]   who can recommend the most effective tax strategies
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.920]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.400]   And my favorite story is that
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.080]   when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.760]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.000]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.960]   So they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.000]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.680]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.320]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.760]   And as an All The Hacks listener,

[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.120]   - You look at some of these cruises
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.840]   and you hear how many people are on there.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.880]   Is everything crazy crowded on these big cruise ships,
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.680]   like, you know, waiting for a water slide
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.320]   or even getting a pool chair at the pool?
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.080]   Is it just chaos with thousands of people on board
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.640]   or have they done a good job at putting enough pools
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.080]   and enough chairs and enough stuff
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.320]   so that a full cruise ship doesn't feel full?
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.680]   - I mean, some cruise lines do it much better than others,
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.800]   of course, but I will say,
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.160]   I don't think it is the case
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.200]   that the bigger the ship, the busier it is.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.040]   Not at all.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.200]   Like, some of the ships that I've been on
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.600]   that have felt a lot busier
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.520]   have been, you know, one or 2,000 guests.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.720]   And sometimes you'll go on a ship with 5,000.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.960]   It's not like you see 5,000 people at any one time.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.320]   So you just don't realize.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.960]   The last ship I got off was around 5,300,
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.080]   but there's 30 restaurants and bars, it said.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.960]   So even if everyone is eating and drinking at the same time,
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.920]   that's just as busy as it would be on land.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.200]   You know, the theater, I guess,
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.920]   is the only time you see a lot of people.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.000]   Sometimes they'll hold 900 people,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.240]   but it's the same as going to the theater on land.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.120]   It's no busier than that, I don't think.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.800]   If you do pay more, you get more space per person.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.120]   - It's funny, we went on a cruise,
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.720]   one of these Bahamas cruises that was so cheap.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.640]   It was three days.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.240]   We stopped at a manufactured island.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.640]   I wouldn't say it was like the best experience.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.040]   Like, it was good, and it opened our eyes up to something.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.120]   One of the things we didn't talk about
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.240]   that was the most interesting
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.800]   was we just met lots of people.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.120]   I found that, you know,
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.680]   if my wife and I were to travel to some country,
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.680]   we would probably meet fewer people
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.960]   than if we cruised somewhere.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.000]   And we met a couple from Finland,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.240]   and we actually stayed in close touch with them.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.040]   We randomly found out one year.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.040]   We emailed them and said, "Hey, how are you doing?"
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.400]   And they said, "Oh, we're in Thailand."
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.360]   And we were in Thailand,
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.320]   and we literally met them again in Thailand,
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.160]   serendipitously. - Oh, wow.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.000]   That's amazing.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.440]   - Have you found that experience on most cruises?
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.120]   You meet lots of interesting people?
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.120]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.120]   And you sort of get into a routine,
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.320]   and you see the same people doing the same things.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.480]   So when I was on my last cruise in Asia,
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.200]   when you would go to trivia in the pub,
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.040]   all Brits.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.560]   And so if I wanted to meet other Brits,
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.400]   we would be there.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.840]   If I take an American cruise,
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.120]   certain groups of people will be in certain places.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.400]   And depending on what you do,
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.240]   you sort of,
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.600]   you just get to know people without even really trying.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.680]   You don't have to, of course.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.880]   I think some people are very afraid
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.600]   that it's gonna be sort of forced fun.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.480]   There's no forced fun.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.160]   You don't have to take part in anything.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.240]   But if you do want to,
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.160]   everyone just chats to everybody
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.680]   'cause everyone's in the same thing.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.320]   I quite like that you have a plan for the week.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.080]   You're all sort of on the journey together.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.800]   Everyone's having a good time.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.240]   You know, that's the whole point of it.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.800]   So I've met so many people who I've kept in touch with.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.000]   Even when I was a teenager and I was cruising,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.120]   I'd go to the kids clubs,
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.920]   and I still have a few of them that I keep in contact with.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.840]   - Kind of reminds me of the hostel experience,
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.400]   especially now that we have kids.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.560]   It was kind of fun when my wife and I were traveling,
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.400]   and we'd stay at a hostel,
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.360]   and we'd meet some couples,
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.200]   and we'd have,
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.920]   I think we called them like ephemeral relationships.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.160]   It's like you have a best friend for three days,
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.480]   and then you don't talk to them again,
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.560]   and it's okay.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.400]   - That's exactly it.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.240]   - We were actually talking recently about how we,
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   it's hard to do that.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.560]   Like we don't do that as adults.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.680]   We don't do that as families,
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.080]   but maybe cruises is like the adult version of a hostel.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.640]   I'm sure they would never want to market themselves
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.960]   that way, but.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.800]   - It is similar.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.400]   And it is so nice to sort of,
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.240]   by the time you've been on the ship for a few days,
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.320]   you see people who you know,
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.800]   you see friendly faces everywhere.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.720]   You check in, you say,
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.400]   "Oh, I heard you're going to this place.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.240]   "How was that?
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.160]   "I haven't had dinner yet.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.000]   "How was that?"
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.760]   And you chat just sort of about the cruise,
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.920]   and that's the way to start a conversation.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.600]   And then you can be out in the bar
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.800]   having a drink in the evening.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.920]   You don't ever have very far to go back to your room.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.840]   You don't have to worry about,
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.120]   "Are you going to get a taxi?
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.200]   "Someone's going to not drink."
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.680]   You just wander down, up the stairs, down the corridor,
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.680]   and go to sleep.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.120]   So I find that really fun.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.680]   - You mentioned there are some cruises
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.520]   where it can be crowded.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.600]   Are there any cruise lines that you're kind of like,
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.520]   you try to steer away from?
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.360]   - Not me personally, because I,
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.600]   as long as I get what I pay for a cruise,
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.480]   I'm more than happy.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.440]   If I've paid nothing, I'm expecting nearly nothing.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.560]   But there's certainly cruises that I go on
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.920]   where I think not everybody would like this.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.960]   And there's a lot of people
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.320]   who would find this very busy and chaotic.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.040]   Some of the Italian cruise lines that I mentioned earlier,
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.480]   it's just very different.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.560]   They just have a different routine in Italy.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.000]   They just start their parties at one in the morning,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   and they're very loud and very colorful.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:17.960]   I find that fun,
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.640]   but I can tell a lot of other people would not enjoy it.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.400]   So I think that's the main thing for me
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.120]   is even if I don't like something,
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.960]   you know, Italian dinner goes on
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.120]   for like three and a half hours,
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:27.960]   'cause it's an event.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.200]   The waiters are dancing, like it's a big thing.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.320]   For us in Britain, that's not something we normally do,
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.760]   but I can say how much fun this person had
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.240]   and who this is for.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.120]   I've done a lot of American cruise lines
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.000]   where the entertainment is really,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.360]   I did "The Price is Right"
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.440]   was on the cruise that I took recently.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.800]   And I was terrified that they were gonna call me.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.520]   I was absolutely so scared.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.600]   I couldn't think of anything worse
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.080]   than getting on that stage in front of everybody.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.440]   But everybody else, they had t-shirts,
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.800]   they had the dance you do,
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.880]   like walking down the stage and everything.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.200]   And it's just, I think matching those right people
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.080]   to the right things.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.680]   But for me personally, I've never done a cruise
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.560]   that I've thought I wouldn't do it again.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.560]   And I've done a cruise on a yacht this year.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.720]   That was very, very nice.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.760]   But even on the yacht, I think if you took someone
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.680]   from the big party ship and you put them on the yacht,
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.000]   they'd be bored out of their minds.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   And if you did it vice versa, they also wouldn't like it.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.960]   So just right people, right cruise ships.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.600]   - I will say, and this may or may not have full validity,
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.440]   but I think I saw it.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.400]   There was two guys that went on a cruise
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.600]   and there was a newlywed game show.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.920]   And they were like, oh, we're not in a relationship.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.760]   We're not even interested in men,
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.920]   but let's pretend and see if we can win the free drinks.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.760]   So the comedy and the outcome here,
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.960]   which I'll just forewarn anyone
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.400]   that might have that same idea,
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.840]   was that they were like, this was great.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.720]   They actually won.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.840]   We rehearsed, they practiced,
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.400]   they knew each other's favorite and everything.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.200]   They won the newlywed show.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.640]   They didn't realize that for the entire week cruise,
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.280]   they replayed the game show in all the cabins.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.960]   And so every single person on the entire boat knew them
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.960]   and every single room they walked into,
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.360]   they would clink their glasses and tell them to kiss
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.200]   and all this stuff.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.040]   - Say cheers.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.720]   - And so keep in mind that if you enter
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.960]   any of these game shows,
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.440]   you will be on every single television for the entire time.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.880]   - You do get to know people like that.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.360]   You're like, oh, it's the man from that.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.240]   Or it's the person who knew so much
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.040]   about this random thing in trivia.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.880]   You don't know who they are.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.560]   You don't know their names, but you're like,
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.600]   oh, that's Harry Potter quiz man, for example.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.440]   - What about other logistics planning?
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.960]   Thinking about cabins, right?
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.520]   There, you know, I've seen some of these ships
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.200]   with so many decks and interior, exterior suites.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.360]   How do you think about making those kinds of decisions
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.320]   and what's worth it?
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.200]   - Okay, so if your main priority is price,
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.640]   you just want to get on a ship.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.480]   That's it.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.560]   An inside cabin's totally fine.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.280]   It's literally just a small hotel room with no windows.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.640]   Every cabin has its own bathroom now, thankfully.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.760]   Some people are still nervous
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.200]   that you have to go down the corridor.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.600]   Everyone has its own bathroom.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.000]   That's perfectly fine.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.200]   You're not going to spend much time
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.280]   if you have an inside cabin,
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.080]   because just sit there and stare at the wall.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.920]   It's not much fun.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.480]   If you do have a bit more
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.000]   and you're not worried about the budget,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.600]   an ocean view is next up, which is just a window.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.760]   Quite nice for some daylight, but that's about it.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.000]   And the most common is a balcony cabin
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.560]   where you have a small piece of outside space.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.480]   You have a couple of chairs on it and a table.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:08.600]   Great for, you know, watching a sail in, watching a sail out.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.680]   I took a cruise recently.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.320]   I went to the Arctic Circle to see the Northern Lights
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.640]   and I had a balcony cabin
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.480]   and the Northern Lights came out in the middle of the night
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.440]   and I was so grateful that I knew.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.400]   'Cause if I was in an inside cabin,
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.880]   I have no idea what was happening.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.640]   So we just sat out on the balcony and that was incredible.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.400]   But that's the most common type now, is a balcony.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.600]   Above that, you can get two-story suites
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.120]   with slides, pianos, if you want to.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.520]   And often big cruise ships
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.480]   will have like an area within them,
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.920]   which is like a ship within a ship
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.480]   where they keep all their suites together.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.280]   So if you're in, for example, the ships with the go-karts,
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.600]   they're Norwegian cruise ships.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.760]   They have an area on board called The Haven
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.880]   and that'll be a collection of suites
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.280]   that has its own pool, it has its own bar,
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.840]   it has its own restaurant.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.920]   So you sort of get that smaller ship feeling,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.040]   but you can just go out and go on the drop slide
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.840]   that goes down 10 stories that I did
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.280]   that was absolutely terrifying.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.960]   So a bit of best of both.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.800]   I think for me personally, people say,
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.400]   "Oh, if you spend more on a cruise, you'll enjoy it more."
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.800]   Generally, that's what people think.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.760]   I don't think that's true
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.040]   because a lot of expensive cruises are small ships
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.120]   and I would miss the big theater shows.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.200]   I would miss the slides.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.480]   I would miss the go-karts.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.400]   So a ship within a ship is a good compromise, I think.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.240]   In a hotel, you'll often see
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.000]   if a hotel room is $300, a slightly bigger one's $400,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.600]   and then the suites can be like two, $3,000,
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.400]   like almost an order of magnitude bigger.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.640]   Does that same kind of principle
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.960]   typically apply on cruise ships
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.040]   or are suites or bigger rooms maybe a better deal there?
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.880]   They can be.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.280]   If you have a big group, say you have five people
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.440]   and you were gonna have to get two or three cabins,
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.960]   two or three normal balcony cabins,
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.560]   sometimes it's cheaper to get a suite
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.880]   if you're okay with all being in together.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.560]   And a lot of cruise lines will do
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.160]   free drinks packages for the suites, stuff like that.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.600]   So you don't wanna assume
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.160]   that just the worst cabin is the cheapest
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.640]   'cause it's not necessarily true
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.480]   'cause they're selling it
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.280]   based on how many do they have left.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.720]   So sometimes a balcony will be cheaper than an inside
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.760]   because they've only got one inside left
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.640]   and they've got 400 balconies.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.480]   Okay.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.920]   And then any other factors when you're booking
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.280]   that I'm not thinking of, decisions you have to make,
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.240]   you know, you have to pick the line, the destination,
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.720]   the cabin, the drinks package,
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.680]   any other things that you have to decide?
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.320]   I'm normally deciding, do I want to fly to the place
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.720]   and spend a couple of days there,
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.280]   spend a couple of days at the end?
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.600]   I ended a cruise in Tokyo recently
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.440]   and absolutely had to stay in Tokyo.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.360]   I would have been so sad to get off in Tokyo
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.400]   and fly straight home.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.280]   But if you have a travel agent,
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.560]   then they'll put all of that together for you if you want.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.240]   If you don't want, you can just book the cruise,
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.480]   you can organize your own flights
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.840]   if you wanna use points or anything like that.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.120]   But I think it's nice to extend it if you can.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.320]   No one wants to be rushing around.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.880]   I mean, I've done a lot of cruises
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.800]   where I've flown at five in the morning
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.520]   and got on the ship in the morning
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.000]   and you end up having a nap and you sort of waste the day.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.840]   So I would recommend at least one day
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.720]   wherever you're going if you're flying.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.760]   - How important is that
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.880]   just from a pure timing perspective?
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.560]   If you get to the cruise and you're late,
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.800]   I assume you miss the cruise and you lose your money.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.720]   - Yes, that is one of the benefits of
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.680]   if you've booked through a travel agent though,
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.640]   it's sort of on them to sort out,
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.080]   but it would be very stressful.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.560]   I think it's a bit different for me now
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.920]   and I take that risk because if it went wrong,
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.640]   it's a great story, it's a great video and it's fine.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.600]   I travel a lot.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.760]   If you were someone who was saving up for one a year cruise,
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.840]   like I used to, it's not worth risking missing the ship
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.520]   for the sake of just staying one extra day
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.240]   because they're not gonna wait.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.440]   They have 5,000 guests,
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.920]   they're not really gonna wait for you.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.280]   They're just being honest.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.480]   - Is travel insurance important in the cruise world?
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.440]   - Yes, so much.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.120]   So the cruise I just got off, we had a medical evacuation.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   When you're at sea, if something goes wrong medically,
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.240]   that's very expensive.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.760]   We had to make a diversion at two in the morning
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.840]   to stop in Spain to drop off a lady.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.360]   And I hope she had travel insurance
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.840]   'cause that can get very expensive.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.520]   Also travel insurance can give you extra things on a cruise.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.120]   So you need to have ticked the cruise box.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.520]   If you just have a normal travel insurance policy,
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.000]   it normally doesn't cover cruises.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.040]   A lot of the bank account travel insurance
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.240]   doesn't cover cruises 'cause it's more risky.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.000]   Just because, imagine you break your leg,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.280]   you need to be helicoptered off
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.760]   in the middle of the Atlantic.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.240]   It's gonna be pretty expensive.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.480]   But what I benefit from most
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.920]   is my policy has missed port cover.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.600]   So if I miss a port because of weather,
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.040]   I get a lump sum of money, which I cruise a lot.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.120]   And I do miss ports because I cruise
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.760]   in odd times of the year in odd places.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.400]   So I think I'm benefiting
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.360]   from my travel insurance policy this year.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.880]   - And you mentioned like if you break a leg
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.480]   and have to get medevac for kind of minor stuff,
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.880]   given how big these cruise lines,
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.640]   do they just have doctors on board
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.040]   that if you're like, "Oh, I need to see a doctor," you can?
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.160]   - Yep, they have medical centers on board if you need.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.520]   Obviously they're not gonna wanna perform surgeries
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.440]   and things on board,
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.640]   but their plan is to keep you okay
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.160]   until you can get to a hospital if it's something serious.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.080]   But if you break your leg, you need an x-ray.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.440]   They have all the x-ray machines.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.400]   They have pharmacies.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.000]   If you forget your prescribed medication,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.440]   they can do everything like that.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.640]   Depends on how big the ship is,
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.160]   but they'll have at least a couple of doctors on board
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.280]   and a nurse team.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.440]   - And that probably comes at an extra charge, I assume?
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.000]   - Yeah, I mean, if you wanted to see a doctor,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.520]   it's probably gonna cost you $100, something like that,
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.040]   just to go to the medical center, so.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.720]   - Cheaper than it would cost with no insurance in the US, so.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.680]   - Yeah, well, I'm from the UK,
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.680]   so people are outraged that it would cost that much.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.960]   - Oh yeah, I was like, maybe in the US you could save money.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.240]   - Yeah, well, the only time I've ever really been
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.160]   in the medical centers
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.440]   was when I started cruising again after COVID,
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.320]   because sometimes you would have to do COVID tests on board
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.160]   for certain reasons.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.080]   So I got to go in there and I took a picture
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.360]   of all of the price list of, I think CPR was like $800.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.200]   - Oh, wow.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.520]   - Which is crazy, but obviously, you know,
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.280]   they'll do it and you'll sort it out later,
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.040]   but you don't wanna risk that.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.360]   - And that's something that travel insurance
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.200]   might also cover.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.160]   - Yeah, travel insurance will cover all of that.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.000]   Anything in the medical center, really, but you do need it.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.600]   People say to me, "I can't afford it."
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.440]   If you can't afford it, you cannot afford the cruise.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.640]   If you can't afford the cruise plus the travel insurance,
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.360]   to be honest, stresses me out.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.720]   - Okay, any travel insurance providers,
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.800]   I mean, I get you're in the UK,
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.280]   but are they mostly local
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.000]   or are there international companies?
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.280]   - I don't think the one I have is international.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.320]   What I normally recommend
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.620]   is using one of those comparison sites.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.920]   I think Aldi is the one in the US that I recommend,
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.440]   just so you can see how much each one covers
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.560]   in terms of medical, missed ports, baggage.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.000]   Obviously, if you're flying, even in the cruise port,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.240]   there's a risk that someone's gonna lose your bag
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.240]   or something like that.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.640]   So it's definitely worth having,
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.200]   but I like to use a comparison site,
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.560]   put in all your information
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.360]   and then see the different packages.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.840]   For me, it's normally worth it to pay more
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.080]   for a higher package,
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:31.600]   'cause I'm guessing I'm gonna have to claim on a missed port
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.040]   and it is true based on how much I cruise.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.000]   I cruise a lot now, but I'm not a normal situation.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:37.920]   - Of course, of course.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.960]   And what about visas and stuff?
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.800]   You mentioned the cruise through Asia,
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.480]   who takes care of the logistics of that?
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.640]   Not everyone's eligible for easy on-demand visas
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.520]   to every country.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.160]   - Yeah, so for the Asia one,
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.720]   it was actually pretty easy for me being from the UK.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.960]   We didn't need in advance visas.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.680]   If I'm coming to the US, I need to get the visa.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.440]   So it's actually harder for me to go to the US
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.120]   than to go to Asia, but it's on you.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.080]   I mean, if you have a travel agent, they'll tell you,
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.040]   they'll remind you.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.720]   The cruise line will have it in the booking documents,
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.120]   but it has a lot of words in the booking documents
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.720]   and people do get turned away.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.160]   Say when I was going on that cruise in Singapore,
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.680]   they check all of your documents if you need them
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.240]   and they wouldn't let you board the cruise
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.040]   if you didn't have the right things in place
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   for the rest of the stop.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.360]   So we had to fill in a lot of landing cards,
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.640]   declaration cards and stuff in Asia.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.360]   But that was all, every day it would arrive in the cabin,
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.080]   it would say, here's an example,
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.720]   here's how you fill in this form.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.120]   And I didn't need any visas.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.400]   - But it's all in advance.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.840]   So let's say for some reason you were ineligible
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.880]   to go to one of the destinations,
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.400]   you probably wouldn't be able to board.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.560]   It's not just that they would say,
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.840]   hey, you have to stay on the boat,
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.400]   you can't leave this port.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.120]   - No, they couldn't take you in.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:46.960]   They wouldn't do it.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.560]   Because imagine if you did break your leg,
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.840]   they couldn't disembark you for a stop.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.880]   They wouldn't even risk it.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.200]   If you need to go somewhere,
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.920]   I mean, we had to do this a lot more.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.080]   After the pandemic, we used to have to have different forms
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.720]   for every single country and it took ages
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.240]   'cause they'd have to go through every single person's form,
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.720]   but they check all of that stuff.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.600]   What most cruise lines do now is you'll check in
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.960]   before you go, like an airline,
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.240]   you'll check in on the website,
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   you'll check in on the app
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.920]   and you'll upload anything you need.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:11.800]   The computer will say,
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.160]   yep, that picture's the same one as the passport.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.680]   Yep, you've attached a credit card.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.840]   And then when you get to the port,
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.800]   it just makes it a lot faster.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.240]   - And you mentioned the pandemic earlier.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.440]   I know there were obviously,
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.160]   everyone saw the news during that time
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.360]   where there were cruises with outbreaks.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.880]   Are there any kind of lingering concerns
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.280]   cruising in kind of a post-pandemic world
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.480]   or is everything kind of back to how it was before?
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.440]   - To be honest, I think cruising was better positioned
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.080]   than most of land in the way that
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.120]   there were always hand sanitizers at the entrance
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.560]   to every restaurant, to the buffet.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.160]   They're very, very clean cruise ships
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.200]   'cause they're held to way higher standards.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.920]   Every time I stay in a hotel on land,
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.720]   I'm like, this would not pass the cruise ship test.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.320]   So I think it's back to normal now on cruises,
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.040]   but normal on cruises is sort of how the world had to adapt.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.880]   So yeah, it's back to normal now.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.720]   There's no limit.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.560]   There used to be limits
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.400]   on how many people could be in each venue.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.760]   You couldn't even touch anything.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.880]   Everything would be in its own little sanitized bag
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:06.720]   for a while.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.560]   It was a bit bizarre,
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.600]   but everything's back to full capacity now.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.320]   I took a cruise, a Caribbean cruise.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.360]   It was 24% full and it was brilliant.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.200]   - Amazing.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.640]   Last question before someone takes off on a cruise
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.160]   and then I'll ask a little bit about the experiences.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.240]   Any thoughts on packing?
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.440]   Are there things that you think,
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.640]   having done this 60 plus times,
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.480]   that you do differently now?
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.560]   - Well, a lot of people, they hold up something
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.560]   and they think, I haven't worn this in three years,
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.360]   but perhaps this is the time.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.200]   And it's not.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.720]   If it's not something that you actually wear in real life,
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.080]   don't pack it for a cruise.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.360]   Of course, you may have an extra formal dress
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.960]   or you may have a tuxedo or something.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.800]   Add that.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.640]   But a lot of the times,
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.160]   the people I know who overpack,
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.360]   they bring half of it home again
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.640]   'cause they put it on and they realize,
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.840]   oh yeah, that one's really itchy.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.480]   I forgot the zip's broken on that.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.320]   Things like that.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.960]   So when I'm gonna go on a cruise,
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.840]   I just stop putting away my clothes
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.320]   and I start putting them in the suitcase
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.240]   once I've washed them.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.760]   'Cause I have my favorite pair of jeans.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.160]   I have my favorite t-shirts
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.840]   and that's what I normally wear on a cruise.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.760]   So I don't think it needs to be as complicated
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.080]   as some people make it.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.920]   I see people bring their own pillows.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.440]   I saw someone bring a, like a water filter jug.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.720]   You have to take,
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.280]   takes up so much room in your suitcase.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.680]   You don't need to bring your own coat hangers.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.720]   You don't need to bring towels.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.040]   You don't need to bring hair dryers.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.000]   They have all of that.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.120]   As long as you have money, access to money,
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.680]   your passport, you can sort anything else out.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.960]   If you did forget a hairbrush, you'll be fine.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.280]   They have shops on cruise ships.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.720]   You know, if you need something,
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.760]   if you have a headache and you need something,
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.600]   you can buy it.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.560]   It's fine.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.680]   - And what about laundry?
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.840]   You know, I know at hotels,
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.520]   it can be the most egregiously expensive thing to be like,
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:37.840]   "Oh, I need to clean some underwear and it's $10 a pair."
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.000]   Like, is it similar?
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.320]   - Yes. On the American cruise lines, yes.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.440]   You can pretty much pay per thing to have it washed for you.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.680]   Or you can buy like a laundry bag
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.120]   and you can fit as much as you want in it, kind of a bundle.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.200]   What I like about some of the British cruise lines,
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.680]   I suppose a few of the Americans,
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.920]   they have just a laundry room where you can go in.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:55.760]   You can do it yourself.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.160]   You can use the machines.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.200]   You can iron stuff.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.400]   I prefer that. Not all cruise lines want to do that.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.680]   On my trip in Asia,
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.640]   I ended up just washing a lot of stuff myself.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.320]   I just bought like a little travel wash.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   I was changing my clothes like three times a day
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.760]   'cause it was so humid on that cruise.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.080]   And things would dry so fast 'cause it was so warm.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.160]   I put it out on the balcony, dry.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.000]   - Love it.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.360]   So that's a lot of the logistics.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.560]   I want to talk about some of the ways
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.560]   that you optimize your experience on board.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.880]   At any point in time, if you have tips or hacks,
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.040]   definitely lay them out.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.560]   Maybe we'll start with food.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.280]   - Okay. So when you go on a cruise,
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.080]   you don't have to spend any extra on food.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:28.920]   At all.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.160]   And I very often don't.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.840]   You'll at least have a main dining room
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.000]   and you'll have a buffet where all the food's included
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.360]   and you can go there anytime.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.160]   Normally the buffet's open like 20 hours a day or something.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.480]   So there's no shortage of food.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.680]   If you're someone who wants to go to,
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.240]   they may have like a special steak house
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.120]   or it may be a Mexican restaurant.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.480]   Sometimes they have ones like that that cost extra.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.040]   They're called specialty restaurants.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.560]   The idea is that they're better.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.600]   That's up for debate whether you think they're better.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.800]   Quite often people will go there
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.520]   if it's a birthday or something.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.680]   I've done them and they're great,
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.920]   but the way I see it normally is I've paid for this cruise
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.480]   and I'm gonna eat the food that I've already paid for
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.480]   because there's no way I can eat everything
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.400]   in a week or two.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.000]   So you don't have to spend extra money on food at all,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.040]   but you can.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.120]   - How's the quality of the food?
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.680]   Like, you know, where would you rank it up
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.400]   against a typical restaurants in the UK or the US?
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.280]   - I think it's tricky
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.040]   because what other people rank as really good food,
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.440]   I don't think is what I like.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.400]   Like some people have very, I don't know,
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.760]   they count themselves as foodies.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.640]   The portions are really small, but it's very fancy.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.240]   That's not really what I like.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.680]   I like to try different foods when I go to different places,
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.760]   like when I was in Asia,
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.560]   but I also like to know that I could just have something
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.920]   that I recognize as well, but it depends.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.480]   I mean, there's so many cruise lines,
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.840]   there's so many ships, there's so many different things.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.920]   If you do wanna sit down
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.760]   and you wanna have some of the restaurants,
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.800]   it's more of a show than a meal.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.640]   You know, it will be, this is on fire,
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.560]   this is steaming, this is bubbles.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.840]   And then other times you'll just go, my last cruise,
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:56.400]   you know, it had a roast dinner, it had fish and chips,
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.920]   it had poolside burgers and pizza and stuff like that.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.600]   So it just depends what you want again.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.120]   - Things like that, like getting poolside service
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.400]   of a burger, is that part of the meal plan?
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.600]   - That's all included, yeah.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.680]   Normally there's some sort of pizza, burgers, hot dogs,
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.960]   you know, it might be like a chicken shack
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.280]   they have on a carnival.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.360]   Fast food like that is normally included in the cruise, yeah.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.720]   It's more if you wanna go for a sit down dinner
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.280]   and you wanna do, you know,
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.240]   sometimes they'll cook the food in front of you,
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.080]   that kind of thing.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.800]   Those ones will be specialty restaurants.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.040]   If you do book a more luxurious cruise line,
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.440]   it tends to be smaller ships,
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.080]   so they tend to have less restaurants,
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.200]   but there'll be included more.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.280]   - You mentioned some ships might have 30 restaurants.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.320]   Any tricks for figuring out if you don't have time
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.760]   to eat at every restaurant, which ones to prioritize?
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.120]   - I mean, I would default to the main dining room
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.840]   is where you have a guaranteed space for every meal.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.160]   So I tend to start there.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.120]   Some days you just don't wanna sit down.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.040]   Sometimes you just wanna get pizza
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.840]   or you just wanna get room service or something like that.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.360]   And anything else is normally,
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:58.280]   you fancy that type of cuisine, I would say.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.120]   You feel like, "Oh, I wanna have a Mexican today.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:01.480]   "I wanna have Indian today."
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.520]   Most things like this, you can pre-book them.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.200]   And if you're gonna pre-book the ones that cost extra,
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.800]   it'll be cheaper if you do it at home.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.700]   Generally speaking, if you want something,
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:12.360]   if you can pre-book it on the cruise line's website,
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.200]   it's cheaper.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.200]   If it's Wi-Fi, if it's drinks,
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.320]   I don't think I've ever seen things be cheaper on board
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.360]   'cause they wanna fill those spaces, don't they?
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.840]   - Okay, and you mentioned room service.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.680]   Is that also included?
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.840]   - 50% of the cruise line?
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.880]   Yes, 50%, no. (laughs)
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.800]   Quite often, it'll be included for breakfast,
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.720]   but not for dinner.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.200]   But even still, on my last cruise, it wasn't included,
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.440]   and I think it was like $6 or something.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.240]   It's not the end of the world.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.840]   If you do just wanna stay in bed, it can be quite nice.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.560]   - When you say things aren't included,
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:42.600]   that doesn't mean you pay $100 a person for dinner
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.240]   if it's at a restaurant that's not included.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.920]   It's probably just a little upcharge.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.760]   - Yeah, it can be.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.900]   I mean, my last cruise,
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.760]   I think it was between five and 10 pounds
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.520]   in this restaurant I went for, so say like $10,
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.120]   which you wouldn't get that same food on land
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.080]   for that price.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.400]   So it can be quite good.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.280]   You normally, well, not normally, but quite often,
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.920]   you'll get onboard credit when you book,
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.360]   which is basically like money
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.040]   that you can only spend on board,
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.800]   and it disappears when you get off.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.200]   So I spend that on specialty meals sometimes
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.760]   'cause it doesn't feel real.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:13.080]   It's gonna go, so I might as well try stuff.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.920]   - And what about non-food, other activities?
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.640]   How do you think people should kind of plan their cruise
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.220]   and all the activities they could do throughout the week?
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.520]   - It's definitely better.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.920]   I know just saying planning is a bit of a cop-out,
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.320]   but the more you can plan,
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.680]   the more you can pre-book things.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.640]   Like a lot of cruise lines,
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.120]   you have to pre-book theater shows now
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.560]   just for so many people who wanna go.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.080]   If you can just book things like that on the app,
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.440]   the apps are very easy to use on the website.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.340]   It just means that you're not gonna be disappointed
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.320]   because you may see,
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.100]   sometimes they have big Broadway musicals,
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.340]   they'll have hairspray.
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.720]   And if you get on board,
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:45.500]   you'd have to join a line, I guess,
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:46.840]   if you haven't already pre-booked.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.400]   So just save yourself the hassle.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.240]   If you wanna do something,
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.160]   just pre-book it as much as you can.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.240]   - Any hidden gem activities you've done
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.680]   in all the cruises you've done?
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.600]   - I've done some really weird things on cruises.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.560]   I mean, I did a 10-story drop slide recently,
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.900]   which was terrifying.
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.600]   One where the floor just drops out
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.020]   and you go down the side of the cruise ship
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.060]   and it has glass.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:07.000]   And in the glass part, I don't know why,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.960]   but you just get stuck
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.600]   and you're in this little cocoon thing.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.720]   It's like a sack, like a, I don't know.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.360]   You get in the sack, cross your hands,
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.720]   and then you have to scoot down
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:16.880]   trying to get through the gap.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.760]   Glad I did it.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.780]   Not rushing to do it again.
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.160]   But I've also done, you know,
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.800]   I've done surf simulators.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.280]   I did a skydive simulator,
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.600]   the one that's sort of in the tube,
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.720]   you know, where the air just comes straight up at you
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.040]   and you sort of hover.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.040]   That was good fun.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.960]   That is one thing, the skydiving,
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.880]   it is free sometimes and paid for sometimes.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.240]   And that's a thing that some cruise lines do.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.400]   They'll make it free when it's not a popular time.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.320]   For example, if you're in port, everyone's off,
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.760]   it'll be free in a port.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.040]   But when you're at sea and everyone's on there,
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:44.920]   they'll charge for it.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.080]   So it's not just as simple as if you see it
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:47.920]   and it has a price
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.820]   that it's always gonna be that price.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.100]   So just a quick Google of,
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.580]   is the North Star on this cruise free?
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.940]   And it will say it's free these times,
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:58.020]   not these other times, at the moment.
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.060]   - What about things to avoid?
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:01.020]   Are there things where you see people being like,
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.580]   "Oh, I'm really excited to do this."
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:05.180]   And you're like, "Oh, you got suckered into the thing."
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.820]   - For me, it's the art auctions.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.980]   I'll never understand it.
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.100]   So they get everyone around,
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.940]   people buy these paintings and stuff.
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.220]   But I look at the paintings,
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.300]   I look at the artists, I Google it
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:15.480]   and I can get it cheaper at home.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.540]   I don't know why people are buying them on board.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.020]   It's just weird to me, I don't understand it.
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:22.300]   - Any other things to avoid or focus on
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.840]   or other hacks you have for cruising?
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.460]   - I think we've covered most things.
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:26.660]   I think generally speaking,
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.300]   the more flexible you can be,
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:29.740]   you can get a better cruise deal.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.100]   And the more you can pre-plan,
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:33.020]   the more enjoyable your cruise is gonna be.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:33.840]   But once you've planned,
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:34.680]   once you've booked everything,
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.700]   you get to the ship,
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:37.220]   you don't have to do anything.
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:38.820]   And I think that's what's really nice.
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:40.260]   You can just go on your own schedule.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.920]   If you're cruising with a big group,
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.140]   I often cruise with my family,
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:44.780]   not everyone wants to do the same thing.
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:45.900]   Someone will go to dinner,
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:47.300]   someone doesn't wanna go to dinner,
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.500]   someone wants to see that show,
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.380]   someone wants to go see the live magician or something,
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.400]   you can all do that.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.000]   So that's one of my favorite things.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.020]   - You said family, what about going with kids?
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:59.060]   I don't know whether you've been in that situation yourself
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:56:59.900]   or witnessed it.
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:02.460]   How should people with especially young kids think about it?
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.540]   - Yeah, so my last cruise,
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:06.260]   I cruised with two of my nieces who are five and 12.
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:07.420]   And that was quite different for me
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:08.860]   'cause I don't normally cruise with kids,
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.020]   but I got to see all of the kids menus
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:12.180]   in all of the restaurants,
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:14.740]   the little kids cutlery they have, the coloring.
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.500]   They all have kids clubs on board
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.900]   and they normally split into age ranges
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.960]   and the kids clubs are free.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.400]   So it's quite a good way to sort of drop off your kid.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.060]   They have a great time for three hours
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.640]   and you get to have a bit of a break
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.900]   from looking after them.
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.420]   Sometimes they'll have a kids club that's free,
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:31.980]   but then if you want late night babysitting,
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.260]   you'll have to pay for that.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.540]   But I say make the most out of the free kids club.
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:36.700]   The kids clubs are so cool.
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.100]   I used to go when I was a teenager and when I was a kid.
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:40.740]   When you're a teenager, it's more sort of,
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.280]   this is just a place to hang out.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.300]   We have Xboxes and we have snacks, but they're cool.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.260]   (laughing)
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.420]   - Yeah, kids love it.
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:49.540]   - When I was prepping for this,
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:51.660]   I know that in most hotels,
[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:54.340]   the kids clubs only work for kids five and over.
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.780]   And I've dug into why.
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.660]   It seems to be that in most countries
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.460]   to get insurance at a resort,
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:02.020]   it's almost impossible to get insurance for under five.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.620]   So if you're traveling a big resort,
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:05.380]   a lot of the kids clubs five and up.
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:08.000]   But for a lot of cruises, when I did some quick research,
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.820]   and this is not gonna be blanket advice,
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.600]   they have younger kid programs,
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.540]   like baby and toddler daycares for six months and up.
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.980]   So that was something I didn't expect.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.780]   - You have to be six months to go on a cruise
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:20.620]   just 'cause I guess medical risk under six months.
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:23.020]   But once you're six months, yeah, you're on board,
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.880]   you have access to all of the soft play areas
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.080]   and they'll have splash parks outside and slides
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:32.060]   and different things that aimed for different age ranges.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.980]   But yeah, for kids, so much fun.
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:35.180]   That's where I started.
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.220]   I do appreciate different things about it now.
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:38.700]   I went to Alaska, my first cruise.
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.300]   I don't remember anything about Alaska.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:43.060]   What I remember is going up and down in the elevators
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:45.300]   and just being silly, but it was so fun.
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.020]   - One thing we didn't mention was about seasickness.
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:50.720]   Is that more common, less common on a big ship?
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.580]   How should people who are a little bit worried
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:53.860]   in that department think about it?
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:54.780]   - People will find it weird,
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:56.620]   but I'm someone who can get seasick
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.180]   because I'm a travel sick person.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.660]   I get travel sick in a car.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.600]   I take medicine to go in the car for a long time.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.060]   I can't go backwards on a train.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.060]   VR makes me feel quite sick.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.800]   So I'm somebody, I think if anyone
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.100]   is gonna get seasick, it's me.
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:10.540]   And I have been seasick before,
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:13.280]   particularly when I went into the Arctic Circle in March
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.260]   on a ship that was 25 years old,
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.940]   but you would kind of expect that.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:20.340]   As far as seasickness goes, cruising out of season
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:22.340]   increases your risk because you're just more likely
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.220]   to find a storm.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:26.380]   If we don't hit a storm, you barely know that you're moving.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.180]   And even when we do hit the worst weather,
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:30.500]   and I try and show people that the ship is rocking,
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.880]   it's like this curtain is swaying two millimeters this way.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.900]   It's not the dramatic things that you think of
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:38.300]   where glasses are falling over and everything's smashing.
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.300]   That's not what happens.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:40.940]   So if you're worried about seasickness,
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.300]   cruising the peak season,
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:43.840]   there's a reason it's the peak season.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.380]   You're just less likely to get bad weather.
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:47.360]   Pick a cruise that doesn't have any sea days.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.260]   If you're not at sea, you're not gonna get seasick.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:51.140]   And there's plenty of cruises where every single day
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:52.140]   you have a different port.
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.820]   And if you can sort of book a cabin that's in the middle,
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:55.860]   you feel less movement.
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.580]   If you're right at the front or you're right at the back,
[00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:59.820]   you just feel more because it's just how ships work.
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.340]   - What about interior versus exterior?
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.180]   For some reason, my instinct would be
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:06.100]   if you were seasick, interior would be the worst.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.280]   - I've tried all of them.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.460]   It's nice to get the fresh air, I think,
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.180]   when you have a balcony, if you're thinking,
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.740]   oh, I feel a bit, get some fresh air.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.860]   But also, then you can see the horizon.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.360]   I don't know if it really makes a massive difference.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.460]   Sometimes just being inside, you just forget.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.860]   So you have that perk.
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.060]   But yeah, balconies, I mean,
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.900]   inside cabins tend to be further down
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.580]   and more on the bottom decks.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.140]   So the movement is less there.
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:30.100]   It is perks and downsides to every single cabin type,
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.620]   but people shouldn't worry about it.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.620]   I think a lot of people think,
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.620]   even if they don't get travel sick on land,
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.780]   in cars and stuff, they think they're gonna get seasick.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:37.940]   Most people don't.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.360]   Even if I say we're on a cruise and the captain says,
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.500]   we're gonna hit a terrible storm, the waves,
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.860]   I'll just take a seasickness pill and then I'm fine.
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.900]   So yeah, it doesn't affect me at all.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.540]   The only thing is the seasickness medicine
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.440]   makes me a bit sleepy,
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.460]   but it doesn't matter if you have a nap on a cruise.
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:52.940]   That's totally fine.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:53.780]   I'm still doing it
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.060]   and I'm a very travel sick person normally.
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:56.900]   - Great.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.860]   Anything on the horizon that's exciting for you
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.340]   in the industry, new ships, new destinations,
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.940]   some place you're going to?
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.900]   - There is so much happening in the cruise industry.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.580]   Because we shut down and now everyone wants to travel.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.580]   Everything is booming.
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.980]   Every cruise line is, I mean, the shipyards are full.
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.580]   To get a slot to build a new cruise ship
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:13.820]   seems impossible at the minute,
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.020]   but I'm hoping to get to Alaska next year
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.760]   because that was my first cruise
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.020]   and I haven't been back there.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.260]   So I'm looking forward to that.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.300]   I'm doing a river cruise soon, which will be nice.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.620]   I really like river cruising.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.640]   If you're someone who really is worried about seasickness,
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.480]   go on the river.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.740]   You never feel a thing because no tides.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:31.220]   - Yeah, my parents just got back from a river cruise
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.860]   in Europe and they went through France and Austria
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.700]   and said it was amazing.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.420]   And in my mind, I never even considered that as an option.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.540]   It was a much smaller boat and they had a great time.
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.500]   - I've done some of the, I say bigger,
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.700]   some of the main big river cruise ships.
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:47.100]   And also I took a cruise recently on a barge
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.460]   that only had 20 people.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.580]   And it was basically like
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.220]   as if your hotel is just following you.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.060]   That's it.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:52.980]   Like every day you would go out.
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.340]   That was actually a cycling cruise.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.900]   So we would cycle every day and then the ship would meet us
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.820]   and then you would have dinner and you'd go to sleep.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.260]   So instead of lugging all your stuff on the back of a bike
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.140]   and trying to unpack every day, your stuff just moves.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.020]   - It was amazing.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.220]   I love river cruising.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.940]   - Had you not just gave that anecdote,
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.500]   I would have been so sad finding out about it later.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.300]   You know, the idea that if you want to take a bike trip
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.180]   through Europe, you could do it with a cruise.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.220]   Are there any other, I don't know,
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:16.820]   strange is maybe not the right word,
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.420]   but unique cruise experiences like that?
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.980]   - I mean, there's all sorts of cruises.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.460]   If you're someone who wants to do, I mean,
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.380]   I've done some 90s themed cruises.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.860]   They were great fun where they get 90s bands on board.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.660]   Every day you have a different 90s dress theme.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:30.740]   There's lots of music.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.100]   Music is very popular for themed cruises,
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.460]   but sometimes they'll have, you know,
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.340]   it might be a TV show and they'll have actors
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:38.660]   from that TV show who are on that voyage
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:40.060]   or they're going to a place.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.060]   Say they're going to where "Game of Thrones"
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:42.900]   was filmed or something.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.060]   They may have like a "Game of Thrones" themed week,
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.420]   which I think is pretty cool.
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.380]   - One cruise carrier you never mentioned.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.940]   How does Disney fit into all of this?
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.700]   - So I've only taken one Disney cruise
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.340]   and I did it after the pandemic
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.100]   where we weren't really allowed to go anywhere.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.420]   So my cruise went nowhere.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.140]   So I don't really feel like I'm qualified to talk about it.
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:02.020]   I mean, if you love Disney, it is very Disney.
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:02.860]   That's what I would say.
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:05.300]   You have to like Disney because everything is,
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.260]   every bit of music is Disney music.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.060]   Every film is a Disney film.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:09.900]   People love it.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.340]   There's so many people who cruise with Disney
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.180]   who would never look at another cruise line.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.020]   You know what?
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.660]   Disney fans, how much they love Disney.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.220]   Just that, but on a ship.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.780]   - What would be either that you've been on
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.780]   or that you would love to go on the higher end side?
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.820]   What would be kind of the aspirational cruise?
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:26.060]   If someone was like, you know,
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.220]   I'm going to spend all my money on the nicest cruise,
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.860]   not just for the sake of spending money,
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.100]   but what's kind of that end?
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.340]   - The one that comes to mind is this summer
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:35.900]   I took a cruise on a yacht.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.620]   It was around $1,000 per night.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:38.820]   I will say that was a press trip.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:39.940]   I don't think that's a surprise
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.700]   that I didn't pay $1,000 per night,
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.500]   but it was as close as you can get to having a yacht,
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.740]   but without any of the stress of having a yacht.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.500]   So it was just fantastic.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.580]   We went around Greece.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.380]   So we had like long ports.
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.460]   We could stop anywhere.
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:54.180]   There weren't many of us there.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.420]   If you needed something,
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.300]   you just tell someone and it will arrive.
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.540]   - What was the line or the ship?
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.820]   - It was called Emerald.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.540]   They're like a river cruise line mostly,
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.780]   and they have just moved into yachts.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.340]   So I've cruised with Emerald on the river,
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.620]   which is very, very nice.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.020]   The yacht cruising is something completely different,
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.300]   but fantastic.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.500]   And surprisingly, I didn't expect to meet people
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.860]   on that cruise who had cruised on the big ships,
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:16.940]   but actually I did.
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.340]   So I thought it would be more of a different customer base,
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.340]   but I guess not.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.980]   - We've looked and never done,
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.940]   but renting yachts is very expensive.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.180]   So when you say $1,000 a night, it's like, whoa,
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:29.260]   'cause it can cost $100,000 a week to charter a yacht.
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:31.460]   - Exactly, and crew, and cleaning,
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:32.700]   and how do you maintain a yacht?
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.860]   I can't even think about it.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:36.220]   So it was as close as I'll ever come, I think,
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.260]   to feeling like I had my own yacht.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.300]   You're treated like absolute royalty.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.620]   There's nothing you could say.
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.780]   I mean, I have these mascots here.
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.980]   You've seen them.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.980]   My channel mascot is a cat from me describing.
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:50.460]   And every day, my cabin room steward
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.460]   would take my cat mascot
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.260]   and put him in a different situation.
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.700]   So they took him to the spa.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.740]   They took pictures of him.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:58.420]   They took him into the galley.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.260]   They took pictures of him making food.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.260]   He went to the bridge.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.180]   He steered the ship.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.980]   And when I came back at the end of the cruise,
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:06.260]   I had my cat mascot on my bed
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.380]   with all of these pictures
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:10.100]   of what he'd been up to during the week,
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.420]   which was just so funny
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.580]   that even a toy gets treated so well.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.020]   It has the best holiday.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:17.820]   - Okay, I came into this thinking, we'll see.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:19.380]   And I was talking to my wife.
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:21.340]   I actually think this sounds like something
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:22.380]   that would be fun for the family.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.140]   I don't know if it's the yacht, the Alaska.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.060]   We got a lot of vacations to go.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.220]   Is that the site where we've got to start comparing?
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.060]   - Just have a look.
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.220]   They have a nice thing on there,
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.620]   which is like what's going in the next 90 days.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.460]   If you just have a space in your calendar,
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.420]   you can sort it by price per night.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:38.460]   So you can just see in the entire world,
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.620]   where is the cheapest cruise?
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:41.060]   It'll be a really random one.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.220]   It'll be like Barbados to Lisbon
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:45.540]   on a Costa cruise or something for $200.
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:46.900]   But it just gives you an idea.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.380]   Then you can go to the Cruise Lines website
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.860]   and sort of look in a bit more detail.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.700]   - Awesome.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.540]   And I know you have so much content on this.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.580]   You have a free course.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.380]   Where can people go if they want to go deeper on cruises?
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.900]   - Yeah, so I keep it very easy.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.140]   I'm emmacruises across all of the internet.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.660]   emmacruises.com is where everything is kind of based.
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.860]   And I review all kinds of trips.
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.300]   So it'll be everything that we've talked about.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.820]   I share a lot of tips for what cabins to book,
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.500]   how to book it, when to book it,
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.980]   where to go, everything I know.
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:14.300]   I make videos about it.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.180]   So I have quite a lot of YouTube videos now.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.820]   I think maybe four or 500.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:20.580]   - I did some research on YouTube, on the website.
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:21.420]   - It's quite a lot.
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.260]   - There's a lot of content.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:23.100]   - It is.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.860]   But the thing is, is you leave a look at a video
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.580]   and you'll think absolutely not or yes.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.420]   And that's good.
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:29.740]   Sometimes I get comments and people will say,
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:32.100]   I'm so sorry, but this looks absolutely awful.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:32.940]   That's good.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.940]   I would much prefer that someone watches the video
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.220]   and says, that would drive me bananas.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.380]   I don't want to do that.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.180]   Or yes, this one's absolutely for me.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.300]   'Cause I think that's the thing.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.580]   It's tricky to try before you buy a cruise.
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:45.820]   It's a big commitment to do not only the money,
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.100]   but also a week of your life.
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.540]   So what I try and do is as much as I can,
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.700]   show someone what they're gonna get.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.540]   That's my plan.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.380]   - I love it.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:54.220]   Thank you for all that.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.740]   I'm gonna be using that as we try to decide what we do.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.020]   And I look forward to letting you know what we do
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:01.180]   and I'll share with everyone here what the cruise is,
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.020]   how we got the best deal and all of that good stuff.
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.940]   So thank you so much for joining me.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:05.780]   - Fabulous.
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:06.620]   This has been a lot of fun.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:07.460]   Thank you.
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.260]   - Wow.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.660]   I hope you all enjoyed that as much as I did.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.380]   And I hope you're interested in cruises
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.980]   even more than you thought, because I know I am.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.660]   If you have any questions or thoughts,
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:18.060]   please feel free to shoot an email
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.340]   to podcast@allthehacks.com.
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.900]   I read every email that comes in
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.700]   and it's a great place to send questions
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.660]   for a future Mailbag episode.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.140]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.220]   I'll see you next week.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.800]   (upbeat music)
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:40.100]   (birds chirping)
