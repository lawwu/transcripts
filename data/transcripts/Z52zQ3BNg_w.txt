[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   I should like to call your attention and to read to you once more certain words
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.240]   found in the third chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles in verses 12
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.920]   to 18. Now we come back in other words to another consideration of this sermon
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.960]   which was preached here by the Apostle Peter to these people in Jerusalem. I
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.480]   would remind you of the occasion which led to the sermon. One afternoon Peter
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.120]   and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer to pray in the temple.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.920]   As they went they had to pass by a poor man who had been born lame and who was
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.960]   now about 40 years of age whom his friends and relatives carried every day
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.480]   and put him to sit on the pavement just outside the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.880]   Of this poor men seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked alms of
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.840]   them. In other words he begged for money something to help him to go on living.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.320]   But you remember what happened. Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.360]   said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something out
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.200]   of them. Then Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give I
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.080]   thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.080]   him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.400]   received strength. And then we come across this lyrical picture of this man
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.560]   leaping up standing walking entering into the temple walking and leaping and
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.240]   praising God. And of course it led to a sensation. All the people saw him walking
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.100]   and praising God and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.560]   beautiful gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.040]   that which had happened unto him. And as the lame men which was healed hailed
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.840]   Peter and John as he wouldn't let them go according to some translators he was
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.600]   embracing them pouring forth his love and his sense of gratitude as he held
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.440]   Peter and John all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:28.960]   called Solomon's greatly wandering. And when people Peter saw it he answered
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.800]   unto the people and then we get his sermon. Now we begin considering this
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.840]   sermon last Sunday night. And I would remind you that we are considering all
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.960]   this in order that we might remind ourselves as to what Christianity really
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.240]   is. And as to what the church really is. We are living in an age of such
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.080]   confusion that we've got to do this. Look at the ideas that are current with
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.760]   respect to what the Christian church is and as to what the Christian message is.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.120]   Now my whole case is that we know nothing about these matters apart from
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.720]   what we have in this book. This is how it began. Let's go back let's be honest.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.400]   Let's not listen to modern men's ideas who doesn't matter who they are. I
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.120]   wouldn't dare to ask anybody to listen to my ideas if they were but my own. No
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.960]   no our business in honest is to go back to this authentic record the only one
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.160]   that we have and find out how it began what it is and what it is continue to be
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.480]   in times of revival and reformation and reawakening and thank God it's all here
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.040]   for us and we've just got to go back and look at it again. Now what we've seen
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.400]   is this. The Christianity the Christian church is not primarily an institution
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.880]   she's a phenomenon. That's one of the great mistakes of today. The church an
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.760]   institution and people start with some great institution but you know the
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.480]   Christian church is not an institution she's a phenomenon. That's what happened
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.760]   here. A phenomenon. The disciples themselves were phenomena. They produce a
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.280]   phenomenon they are used to produce a phenomenon in these men sitting at the
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.400]   beautiful gate of the temple. This is the thing that arrests people and then the
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.280]   church delivers her message to them. And what we saw last Sunday night was this.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.940]   We were interested in the things that Peter didn't do. We pointed out that he
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.320]   didn't preach a sermon on miracles and they have a great discussion. Are miracles
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.640]   possible? Can a man who's scientific in outlook believe in a miracle? Not a word.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.240]   He says why are you looking at this? Or why are you looking at us for that matter?
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.960]   He said you know the thing you must concentrate on is not the phenomenon
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:04.400]   even. It's not the miracle nor us. What you must concentrate on said Peter is
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.840]   that to which this miracle and we ourselves point. That's the thing to
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.480]   concentrate on. What is that? Well you see he tells them that the thing they're to
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.080]   be interested in is their relationship to God. Peter doesn't regard these people
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.000]   just as spectators. He discourages this curiosity that comes rushing along to
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.360]   examine phenomena. He won't have it. And what he does we saw to our amazement last
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.400]   Sunday night is this. They come excited and amazed about the miracle. And this is
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.600]   how Peter begins to preach. He doesn't even stop with the Lord Jesus Christ. He
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.160]   looks at them and he says the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:59.160]   Jacob, the God of your fathers. He takes them back to the foundation of the world
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.800]   and beyond it. To the everlasting God who has made a covenant with men to redeem
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.680]   him through his dear son. He preaches in other words the great message of the
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.520]   whole Bible to them. And then you see having started in that way he proceeds
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.040]   in the manner that we are going to consider this evening. Here is his basic
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.120]   point. That you and I are to be concerned primarily and
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.000]   fundamentally about our relationship to God. That's the one thing that really
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.440]   matters. And the way in which that is crystallized for us once and forever is
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:53.280]   in our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ. That's Peter's message. He won't
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.920]   have this idle curiosity, this intellectual approach to the problem of
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.120]   Christianity. He won't have it. He brings them immediately to a consideration of
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.040]   themselves and their own case and condition. Now if you want the technical
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.960]   term which is so popular at the present time for all this, you can put it like
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.840]   this. Peter tells them that the problem is an existential one. What does that mean?
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.520]   Well it means this. That you don't sit back in an armchair and consider
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.400]   theoretically the problem of God and of Jesus of Nazareth. No, no. You do it under
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.960]   judgment. You do it with a sense of personal relationship. You do it in a way
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.800]   which indicates that you realize that everything depends upon this. You're not
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.600]   a spectator. You're not a theoretician. It vitally affects your soul and your
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.040]   eternal destiny. Now that is what Peter does, you notice, in this sermon. And this
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:56.560]   is the business always of the Christian Church. Let me say it once more. We are
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:04.400]   held face to face with this historic person. My dear friend, what you may think
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.840]   about miracles is utterly irrelevant tonight. That's not your problem. That's
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.360]   what people want to be arguing about, isn't it still? A miracle is possible. Can
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.520]   the 20th century man of everybody believe in miracles? Can he believe in
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.960]   the supernatural even? We are told it's impossible for him to do so. So we have
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.600]   to cut bits of the Bible out and just have some message that pleases the
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.640]   modern man. But they say that's not the problem. This is the problem. This person,
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:44.440]   this Jesus, this person who appears before us in the pages of the New Testament,
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.080]   and he's a person who belongs to history. We are not interested primarily in
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.200]   Christian teaching. We are interested in him, the teacher. You see how people go
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.080]   astray today, their tremendous interest in his teaching. So you get in all your
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.320]   annual assemblies of your great denominations, resolutions passed and
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.400]   sent to the governments of this country and governments of the United States and
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.560]   the world. That's regarded as Christianity today. What we think about
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.440]   Vietnam or the Dominican Republic or South Africa, the apartheid, these are the
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.960]   things that are occupying people's minds. And they think that the way to decide
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.080]   whether you're a Christian or not is your particular view on these odd
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:33.120]   subjects. It isn't, you know. Here's the question. This person, this historical
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.520]   person, what's our relationship to him? That's the thing that Peter preaches
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:46.080]   about. And he will not allow them to have interest in anything else. No, no, he says
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:52.320]   don't look at this, don't look at us, look at him. Now how does he do this? Well this
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:59.840]   is the most amazing thing. Peter's manner here is the most dramatic one. Looked at
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.800]   merely from the standpoint of language, this is an extraordinary passage. Are you
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.360]   interested in paradoxes? Well here you've got them. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his son Jesus, whom you
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.240]   delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.280]   determined to let him go. But you denied the Holy One and the just, and desired a
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:27.320]   murderer to be granted unto you. You killed the prince, the author of life,
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:33.160]   whom God has raised from the dead. Do you see it? He puts it in this dramatic form.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.160]   Why? Well because he's preaching to them. He's bringing the message home to them.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.200]   And he's pressing upon them the relevance of this person, Jesus of
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.360]   Nazareth, to them. And you see he does it in this way, and this is his object and
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:56.120]   his intention. He says, "No, brethren, I walked through ignorance, he did it. As
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:03.560]   did also you rulers." He's kind to them, he's sorry for them. He says, "I know that
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.760]   you did what you did when you shouted away with him, crucify him. I know you did
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.000]   it in ignorance, your rulers were equally ignorant." But this is the point he brings
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.320]   to them, and this is the message of the Christian Church to the whole world
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:26.440]   tonight. These people thought that they had finished with Jesus of Nazareth. They
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:32.360]   cried out in the crowd, "Away with him, crucify him." And he was crucified, and he
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.120]   died. And they took his body down and buried it in a grave. And they said, "That's
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:45.000]   that!" But it wasn't. And this is the very essence of his message. They thought that
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.080]   they'd finished with him once and forever. So Peter puts it like this to them, "You're
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:58.640]   interested in this, this miracle. You're interested in us. You think we've got
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.360]   some special power or holiness. You're quite wrong," says Peter. "Do you know what
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:12.560]   this is? Do you know what we are? It is he, the one you thought you'd finished with."
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.440]   Here's the essence of his message. The one whom they thought they'd got rid of
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.240]   is confronting them, confronting them in the very miracle that they're interested
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.440]   in. They can't see him, but he's there. He, the one they've rejected, is the
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.920]   explanation of the phenomenon in which they're so interested. And so he proceeds
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:39.880]   to preach the Lord Jesus Christ to them. And my dear friends, this is my message
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.080]   this evening. This is the message of the Christian Church in all ages and in all
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:50.920]   generations. The world rejects him. The world in its cleverness denies him and
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:56.040]   thinks it's disposed of him. They explain him in their various categories and
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.200]   they've got him taped as they think. And they've put him where he belongs. But
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.680]   they can't do so. He keeps on coming back. He still confronts us. We can't get away
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.520]   from him. And here he is dominating the universe and the whole of history
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:20.240]   tonight, as he's always done. And the great question for us at this moment, the
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:29.960]   great question always is simply this. What think ye of Christ? What is our
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.720]   attitude to him? What is our relationship to him? That's what Peter preaches about.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.120]   Not the miracle, I say again, but the Christ who's worked it. And that is the
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:47.500]   only problem confronting us. Let's look at it together. Now here, you see, is the
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:53.480]   thing that baffled these people to whom Peter was preaching, as it has continued
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:59.200]   to puzzle and to baffle succeeding generations of men and women. Jesus of
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:06.000]   Nazareth, the person, but especially his death upon the cross. Now here is the
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.520]   difficulty that people say that they have. And we've got to look at this.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:17.280]   Listen to Peter putting it all before them. Jesus. He calls him Jesus because
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.160]   his name was Jesus. He'd been known by these people and others as Jesus of
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:28.840]   Nazareth. In other words, we are confronted by a man, as I say, who belongs to history.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:35.920]   The one who has divided all history into BC and AD. You're confronted by this
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.120]   person as he is portrayed to us in the pages of the four Gospels. And you look
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:50.720]   at him and you see that he is verily and truly a man. Born in a stable, brought up
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:57.320]   in Nazareth, worked as a carpenter. Here is a man who belongs to history. But then
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:02.240]   at the age of 30, you suddenly see him setting out in an extraordinary public
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:08.480]   ministry, which lasted for some three years. You go through his teaching and
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:14.280]   you feel as you read it, like that soldier, the Roman soldier who was sent
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.940]   to arrest him and who came back saying, "Never men speak like this, men." Something
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:25.560]   strange and extraordinary about his teaching. And then you read the accounts
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.280]   of his miracles. These were always arresting attention. How anybody can deny
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.520]   the miracles and believe anything about Jesus Christ, I don't know. They're part
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.120]   and parcel of the whole story. If you take them out, how do you know what you've
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.160]   got left? What can you believe? The moment you begin to pick and choose, you've got
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:52.760]   no authority except your own subjective feeling. And that is not only to be
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.720]   disloyal to the Scriptures, but it is to be foolish. Because you're setting
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.140]   yourself up, it is you who decide and how can you? No, no, you must take the picture
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.960]   as it is. Why did he ever make this impact? Why does a carpenter from Nazareth
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.320]   create this disturbance that he did? Why has he, as I said, dominated human
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:18.840]   history? You've got to confront this fact. And here is the only answer. He not only
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:24.360]   taught as he did, he worked miracles. And he astonished and astounded the people.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:31.920]   But the most amazing thing of all about him was the claims which he made. And he
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:38.120]   kept on doing so. He claimed a unique authority. He would say without any
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.680]   hesitation, though he was a carpenter and had never been trained in any of the
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.840]   schools, he have heard that it was said by them of all time, "But I say unto you,
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:56.320]   he keeps on saying that. He says that he is to be believed and followed. He doesn't
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.120]   hesitate to turn to a man sitting at the receipt of customs and say to him, "Follow
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:06.400]   me." Expecting the men to leave everything and to follow him, which he did. Matthew.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.320]   He did the same with the sons of Zebedee the fisherman, and they left everything
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:19.000]   and followed him. He claims a unique authority. He claims an absolute allegiance.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.400]   But above all he claims that he's in a unique relationship to God. He doesn't
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:32.360]   hesitate to say, "I and the Father are one." He doesn't hesitate to say that he's
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.040]   the light of the world. He doesn't hesitate to say that he is the Savior of
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.760]   the world. He doesn't hesitate to say that he's come to give his life for
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:48.720]   ransom for many. These are the astounding claims that he makes. And there they are.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.640]   And these people had heard them. These things, as Peter keeps on reminding them,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.520]   were well known to them. And as you read the Gospels you will find that at first
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.480]   he made quite an impression upon them. But gradually the people and their
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:06.940]   leaders especially turned against him. So you are confronted by this which
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:14.120]   appears to be a contradiction. Here is one with such extraordinary knowledge, yet
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:22.120]   having never learned. Here is one with such amazing power. Here is one who makes
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:31.280]   this exalted and exceptional claim. And yet he ends his life on a tree, on a
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:40.240]   cross. This one who could even raise the dead is arrested in apparent weakness.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:49.400]   He's charged as a felon. And he seems incapable almost of defending himself.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:55.000]   And then of course comes this great question. Pilate himself was an
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.920]   intelligent man at Innovent. And Pilate could see that there was no case against
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.960]   him. And he wanted to set him free. You may remember that his wife had had an
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.040]   extraordinary dream. And she sent a message to her husband Pilate and said
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   don't do anything wrong to this man. I've had a dream concerning him.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.600]   Be careful what you're doing. And he agreed. This is what he felt himself, his
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.320]   own intelligence had brought him to this conclusion. That the Jews rarely had got
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.600]   no case against him at all. But it seemed to be some personal spite and enimous
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.800]   and jealousy. So Pilate was anxious as Peter reminds them to let him go. He was
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.160]   determined to let him go. But they wouldn't have it. Pilate said to them no
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.680]   Lucia he said you know it's the custom at this time for me to release a prisoner
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.520]   to you. And it was the custom. At this season of the year one prisoner was
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.480]   always released to the people. So Pilate put the choice to them. There was another
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.720]   prisoner, a man called Barabbas, who was a murderer as Peter reminds them. Which
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.120]   are you going to have? They said Pilate to them. And they said give us Barabbas.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:08.280]   They chose the murderer and said that this man should be put to death, that he
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:16.880]   should be crucified. And so he was taken and again in utter weakness. We see him
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:22.840]   staggering up Golgotha. Failing, faltering and falling under the weight
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.680]   of the cross. And there we look at them nailing him to the cross. He appears to
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.080]   be so utterly helpless. Now this is extraordinary. The people at the cross
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.920]   hurled it at him and they said thou who could save others come down save
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.560]   yourself. You say you're the Son of God. If you are prove it come down from the
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.800]   cross. Even one of the two men that was being crucified with him threw it into
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:53.960]   his teeth and said save yourself and us. If you are what you claim to be. But he
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.440]   didn't and he died and he died before the other two. The soldiers who came to
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.480]   examine the executions were amazed that he was already dead. He seems
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.400]   exceptionally weak and he died. And they took down the body and they buried it in
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.800]   a grave and rolled a stone over it and put a seal upon that. And soldiers to
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:17.480]   guard the tomb. And the crowd and the rulers came to the conclusion that that
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:23.840]   was the end of the story. That all his claims were nonsense. That he was an
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.320]   imposter. They had different explanations. The Pharisees saw in him one who
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:35.680]   endangered their jobs, their posts. Others saw the Sadducees clever politicians saw
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.820]   the danger that he might upset the Roman Emperor and the Roman governor in a
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.760]   political sense and said it was better to get rid of him and save the nation.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.320]   You remember the wisdom of a man called Caiaphas that though he figured it out
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:54.960]   they all had their various reasons but they were unanimous in this. That he
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:02.560]   was only a man. And that now they disposed of him. That they'd have no more
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.520]   trouble with him and that was the end of the story as far as he was concerned. He'd
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.480]   made these great claims. The foolish people who were following him ignoramus
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.520]   is just workmen artisans. They'd believed him but of course that's what you expect
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.600]   such people to do. But it's all wrong obviously the whole thing is proved. He
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.480]   died in weakness. What can he have been but a man? And that's the end of the
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:31.000]   story and he's a failure. Now that was their verdict. And Peter was preaching to
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.200]   people who believed that. My dear friends before I go any further I must ask you a
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:48.880]   question. What do we make of all this? What have you made of Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.040]   What have you made of this figure that appears here in the four Gospels in the
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.240]   New Testament? What's your reaction to him? Have you thought about him?
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:04.360]   Have you considered his message to you? Have you considered what all this means?
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:11.240]   What is he to you? Is he only a man to you? Perhaps you unlike these Jews of old
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:16.880]   perhaps you say, "Ah well I regard him as the greatest man who's ever lived. I
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.080]   regard him as the greatest teacher the world has ever known. I do indeed verily
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.200]   believe he's the most moral individual the world has ever known." Indeed I go
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.720]   further. I say that if only the whole world put into practice his teaching, the
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.760]   Sermon on the Mountain, especially these leaders of the nations, we'd get rid of
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.760]   war and they'd have no bombs any longer and the world would be a wonderful place.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.440]   We need to put these things into practice. We must implement them in a
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.760]   political sense and we'll make the world a better place to live in. Is that it?
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:54.520]   Just a man, a teacher, a political agitator, a great seer, one with unusual
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:59.600]   understanding, but only a man. And of course some of them even go further
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:06.360]   today and say that, "Well he was of course a failure. He died with a broken heart
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.440]   when he said it is finished. What he really meant was it's all up. I failed.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.200]   They won't listen to me." But then they say, "That's all right. You know the world
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:21.160]   has never understood its greatest men. Truth forever on the scaffold, wrong
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.080]   forever on the throne. It's all right. He was a great man. The world wasn't ready
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.040]   for him. It didn't understand him. And so though he died with a broken heart,
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:38.360]   saying it's all up, it's finished. His memory and his teaching have continued
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.560]   and still have their influence upon mankind. And it's our business to see
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.720]   that they have more and more and greater and greater influence. Is that your
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:54.040]   attitude? Here's the question of all questions. Jesus of Nazareth, man,
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:25:06.520]   teaching, claims death, burial. The question I ask is this, is that all? How do you
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.800]   understand it? How do you understand him? How especially do you understand his
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.540]   death? Now that's the very thing that Peter expounded to them. And you notice
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:21.320]   the way he did it. All I'm going to do is to take Peter's headings, not mine. You
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   know it's a great thing, this preaching, if you let others preach for you. I don't
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.280]   understand the sort of preacher you know is in great difficulty every Saturday
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.180]   looking for a text for Sunday and trying to get a sermon. It's all here. I'm not
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:38.080]   preaching. It's Peter preaching. I'm simply holding it before you. Notice his
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.220]   headings. Now Peter says, "How do you approach this question?" That's it. He says,
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:49.840]   "You, you shouted away with him, crucify him." Why did you do that? "Well," says Peter,
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.320]   "you did it, you know, because your whole approach was wrong." What does he mean by
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:01.300]   this? Well, he means exactly the same with respect to the modern man. Peter says the
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:06.200]   way to look at him and to consider him is to take him in his setting, take him
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:12.320]   in his background. In other words, you start with prophecy. Prophecy. Do you
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.960]   notice how he keeps on putting it? Listen to this, "Those things which God before
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.300]   had showed by the mouth of all his prophets that Christ should suffer, he
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:28.680]   hath so fulfilled." Listen to him again, "Whom the heaven must receive until the
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:34.480]   times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.160]   holy prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, a
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.600]   prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.000]   Him shall he hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto." Yea, and all
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken, have
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.560]   likewise foretold of these days." Now then, this is preaching. Look here, says Peter,
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.480]   you're looking at this, you're looking at us. You say, "What is this?" Now, says Peter,
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.640]   the way to understand that is this, "These things, these days in which we are
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.000]   living, these events, what are they? How do you understand them?" Go back, he says,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.960]   listen to the prophets. You don't just look at these. If you want to understand
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.040]   these, go back and start with the prophets. And here to me is the most
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.000]   profound insight into this whole matter. You see, the modern man, he starts with a
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.800]   picture of Jesus. He gets it in books rather than in the Bible, and he figures
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.280]   this out, and he comes to his conclusions. If you want to understand Jesus of
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:49.080]   Nazareth, you've got to know your whole Bible, the whole of it. Why do I say that?
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:56.240]   Well, listen to the language of Peter. He says, "God before had shown by the mouth
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.280]   of all his prophets." In other words, he says that when you read the prophecies
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.520]   of the Old Testament, you're reading God, what God has said. It's God who's shown it.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.760]   These prophets were not just ordinary men, these were men who were given a
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.800]   message by God. God was speaking through them. Indeed, he goes further back. In
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:21.760]   verse 21, he says, "God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:27.520]   world began." And then he mentions one, Moses. That's one of the first of them.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:34.040]   And he lived at Innerid 1,400 years before the birth of Christ. He was the
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.320]   man whom these Jews revered, their great national leader, their great lawgiver
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:43.880]   and teacher. He says, "Moses spoke of these days." Then he says, "Samuel, your
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:49.440]   great prophet, he did exactly the same thing. These men have all spoken of these
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.760]   days." And it wasn't they were speaking, these were God's holy prophets. It was
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:01.280]   God who was speaking through them. And here is the thing that needs to be
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:08.120]   realized at this present time. There's only one way to know who Jesus Christ is
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.040]   and our relationship to him. It's to look at him in this book, it's to listen to
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:17.240]   what this book has got to tell us about him. And take these prophets, you remember,
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:22.760]   our Lord himself did the very thing that Peter was doing on this occasion. Peter
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.960]   was a very wise man. He was now filled with the Spirit and in preaching to this
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.240]   crowd he was repeating what Christ had said to him and the others in that upper
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:36.440]   room at Jerusalem. You remember how all these men were utterly crestfallen and
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.840]   cast down when Christ died and was buried. They felt it was the end. They
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.440]   didn't understand. The two men on the road to Emmaus and our Lord joined them
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.880]   and said, "Oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.760]   Ought not Christ to have died and to have suffered these things?" And then you
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.520]   remember our Lord in the upper room he says, "What's the matter with you?" And you
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.280]   remember we are told that he expounded to them in verses and the Psalms and the
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.560]   prophets the things concerning himself. He says, "What's the matter with you? You're
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.120]   looking at me. Can't you see who I am? Read your prophets. See I am the
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:19.440]   fulfillment of the words of the prophets." And it's the only way to understand him.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:25.920]   This is God's Word my friends. Why do you pay so much attention to modern books?
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:32.120]   Who are men? What do they know? They know more than you do. Here is God speaking
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.700]   through the mouth of his holy prophets and he's done it centuries before the
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:42.040]   events. And what you get in the prophets, well what you get in the prophets is an
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:49.440]   account of this person. God promised a way back that he would send a deliverer,
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:55.840]   a Messiah into this world. That men in listening to the devil had made himself
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.280]   the slave of the devil, and had put himself under the dominion of the devil, and
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.520]   could never set himself free. But God had said, "I'm going to send a deliverer, a
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.480]   Messiah." He described him, you know. He even told that he would be born of a
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:15.320]   virgin. Told him, told them that he'd be born in Bethlehem. Gave them all sorts of
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.920]   details, even including that that he'd ride on the fall of an ass into Jerusalem
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.080]   just before his crucifixion. Said that he'd be led as a lamb to the slaughter.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:30.000]   It's all there, and that he should rise afterwards. God, through the mouth of his
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.960]   holy prophets, had given a description of the person, given a description of his
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:40.200]   words. The bruised reed, he will not break. The smugging flax, he will not quench.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.920]   And you've often been struck, as you read your four gospels, at the multiplicity of
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.760]   Old Testament quotations. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:54.280]   prophet. Of course, all that is true of him had been prophesied. It's all there.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:59.720]   He himself, his life, his teaching, and above all, as Peter reminds them, his
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:05.600]   death. Those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:13.960]   that Christ should suffer. He hath so fulfilled. Now that's the way in which
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:19.680]   you begin to approach the question. You don't just sit down, you see, and read a
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:25.800]   modern book on the problem of Jesus. Not at all. Go back to Genesis. Read away
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.320]   through and keep your eye on him, and you'll see him everywhere. And you'll see
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.680]   this person fulfilling it all. That's how you begin. That's how Peter began. Then he
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:40.160]   comes, of course, to the fact of the resurrection. And this is a vital part of
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:46.440]   the preaching. Why is this lame man hanging on to Peter and John? Why is he
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.240]   embracing them? Why is he kissing them? Why is he able to do it at all? Why isn't
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.200]   he still sitting on the floor, on the pavement? What is this? You're looking at
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.120]   us, says Peter. Well, very well, you can't understand me, except in terms of Jesus.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:05.000]   What is this? Well, says Peter, you see, you crucified him and you put him to
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   death, but God raised him from the dead, whereof we are witnesses. Now this is
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.560]   again a vital point. Would there ever have been a Christian church at all if
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:26.520]   it had not been for the literal fact of the resurrection? And remember that
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.160]   resurrection means that he literally rose in the body. Not that his influence
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.200]   went on. Not that he's now in the spiritual realm and that you can make
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.080]   contact with him as you can with the spirits of the departed through some
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.920]   spiritualistic medium. That's what's being preached as a resurrection by many
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.800]   today. That isn't what the New Testament talks about. Peter says we are witnesses
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.720]   and they were witnesses in this sense, that he said to them in the upper room,
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.400]   "I'm not a ghost. I'm not a spirit." They were frightened, you remember. It suddenly
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.720]   appeared in the midst, though the doors were bolted. And they thought this is a
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:05.000]   ghost, this is an apparition. And he said, "A spirit hath not flesh and bones as he
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.680]   see me have." He says, "Have you got anything to eat here?" "Yes," they said, "we've got a bit
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:13.320]   of fish." "Broiled fish and honey, let's have it," he said. And he sat and he ate in
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.480]   their presence. Peter says we are witnesses of these things. And my dear
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.120]   friends, we wouldn't be here tonight if this hadn't literally happened. There
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.560]   would never have been a church but for this. These men were shattered when he
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.960]   died. What brought them into being? What gives them this message? It's he, he's
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.560]   risen. We are witnesses of these things. This is how you understand Jesus Christ.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.880]   You don't just take the Sermon on the Mount and his teaching and say that's
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.800]   what they need to know about in South Africa or that's what they need to
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.880]   understand in the government of this country and America. No, no, you look at
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:51.200]   this blessed person. Who is he? Well, here's the answer. Prophecy. Resurrection.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:35:02.140]   Not only that, Pentecost. Pentecost. You have Peter and John working this
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:07.760]   miracle. What enables them to do it? Isn't our power or our own holiness, says
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:13.440]   Peter? What is it then? Well, he's given us power. His name through faith in his
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.800]   name has given these men this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.400]   There's nothing in us, says Peter, we were like you. I was a craven coward. I denied
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:25.560]   him myself to save my skin. What's happened to me? I've been baptized with
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.800]   the Holy Ghost. He has sent down the Spirit as he said he would and he's done
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:37.360]   it. Pentecost power. The risen Christ enduing his servants with authority and
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:47.760]   might and power. And you know, said Peter, he's still exerting it. His name through
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:53.240]   faith in his name has given this man this perfect soundness in the presence
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.600]   of you all. He says don't look at the miracle, look at the one who worked it.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.040]   Don't try to understand this marvel. Can't you see there's only one who can
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:05.880]   produce it? He's made us what we are. He's made him what he is. It's this risen
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:13.840]   Christ who sent down his Spirit. This is the result. And that is how all of us
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:19.880]   should approach this question of Jesus of Nazareth. How do you explain the
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:25.620]   persistence of the Christian Church? Men would have ruined her long ago. Look at
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.100]   the heresies that have come in. Look at the false teaching that's had to be
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.200]   cleared out. Look how men put organizations instead of a living Christ.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.440]   Look how it's become an institution, dead and filled with pomp and power, having
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.520]   silver and gold but having no spiritual authority. Look how she's become
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:47.720]   political. Oh, men would long since have destroyed her. There's only one reason
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:56.520]   why she still persists. It is this living Christ. And throughout the centuries he
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.000]   takes hold of men and women, lame, hopeless, impotent, helpless in sin and
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.280]   iniquity and shame, and lifts them up and sends revival and authority and power.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:15.080]   And on goes the Church. What does it all mean? Well, let me put it like this to you.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:21.760]   Peter now gives them the answer to it all. He says, "There are the facts. Why don't
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:31.140]   you face them? Let me tell you what you've done," says Peter. "You denied the
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:45.160]   Holy One and the just. You killed the Prince or the author of life." There's
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:53.880]   only one explanation of these things. He is not only a man. As Peter puts it at
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.800]   the very beginning, "The God of Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:09.960]   fathers hath glorified his Son, his servant, Jesus." Yes, he is a man. But he's
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:19.120]   not only a man. He is the Son of God. You remember how Peter, preaching on the day
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.600]   of Pentecost, had made this self-same point. He'd quoted Psalm 16. He is quoting
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:29.400]   David in that Psalm, and this is what he says, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:37.280]   hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." "Men and brethren,"
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.480]   says Peter, "let me freely speak unto you of the Patriarch David, that he is both
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.920]   dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day." Therefore, being a
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:50.240]   prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an earth that to him, and
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.520]   that of the fruit of his vines according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:00.640]   sit on his throne, he seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:07.160]   his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. Who is
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:16.320]   Jesus of Nazareth? There's only one answer. He is the Holy One of God. You
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:21.720]   remember what the Archangel Gabriel had said to his mother Mary before his very
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:30.040]   birth, before his conception even. The Archangel, in speaking to Mary, said, "That
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:39.160]   holy thing that shall be born of thee," he wasn't born of natural generation, he
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.880]   had no human father, "the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.880]   highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore, that holy thing that shall be born of
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.320]   thee." My dear friends, this is the only explanation of this. You see, the
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.920]   resurrection proves it. Yes, the only one who's ever risen from the dead. There
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.600]   have been holy men before, but they were all imperfect. They were not the holy
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:08.640]   ones, but here is Son of God. This is the message of the incarnation. He's man, yes,
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:15.320]   but he's God. He's the eternal Son of God. He's the Son of God. He is that Holy One.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:22.120]   He's as holy as God the Father, and he's just. You preferred a murderer, you
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:27.840]   preferred one who was utterly unjust. He's just. He's without sin, tempted in
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:34.320]   all times like as we are, yet without sin. No blemish, no imperfection, nothing wrong
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:40.200]   in mind or thought or action. The Holy One, the Just One, and above all, he says,
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:49.960]   he is the Prince of Life, and that means the Author of Life. And this is what the
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.960]   whole of the New Testament claims for him. Do you remember John? "In the
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.540]   beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:04.840]   was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:11.080]   anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men."
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:18.480]   He is the Author of Life. He's the one through whom God has created the whole
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:24.240]   cosmos, and he sustains it all by the Word of his power. That's who he is. The
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:30.960]   resurrection proves it. You remember Paul putting this point to the Romans? Jesus
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:38.640]   Christ, he says, "born of the seed of David according to the flesh, but declared to
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.440]   be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:51.000]   resurrection from the dead." Who is this? Yes, man, teacher, miracle worker, all that
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.880]   you can say, but not only that. He's killed, he's buried, he bursts us under
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.640]   the bands of death. "Thou shalt not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thine Holy One
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:06.240]   to see corruption. It was impossible that he should be held of death." And he rises
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:14.160]   proving that he's the eternal Son of God, God and man, the man Christ Jesus, Jesus
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:25.680]   the Son of God. Well, well, very well, you say. That sounds very plausible to me, but
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:32.440]   in that case, why did he ever die? You leave me with a problem. Why did he ever
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:37.560]   die if he's the Son of God? If he is the Son of God, why didn't he escape to
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:42.280]   heaven? He could have done it according to you. He could work miracles, he
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:47.380]   could raise the dead. Why then did he die? Why did he suffer? My dear friend, you're
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:51.280]   asking a good question. It's the most important question a man can ever ask. As
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.480]   you realize it's the most important question for you in this world, here is
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:02.320]   the most important question facing every one of us. Why did the Son of God die
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:09.800]   on that cross on Calvary's Hill? And there's only one answer, Peter gives it
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:17.440]   here. "Those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:24.520]   that Christ should suffer, which can be translated which Christ must
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:32.440]   suffer, he hath so fulfilled." Listen to this again, there's even a better
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:38.120]   translation. "Those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:50.400]   his prophets that his Christ, his Christ, should suffer, he hath so fulfilled."
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.480]   What's it mean? Well, here I say again is the message of the whole of the Bible.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.880]   Here's your explanation of your Old Testament. This is the thing that's
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.360]   prophesied. All the prophets, he says, all the holy prophets beginning with Moses
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.720]   coming right down, indeed from the foundation of the world, they've all been
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.560]   saying and writing about these days. What have they been saying? Well, what they've
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:16.760]   been saying is this, that the offering of Abel was more acceptable to God than
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.520]   that of Cain. Why? Well, because it was a blood offering and not merely an
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.880]   agricultural offering. What have they been saying? Well, what they've been
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:33.200]   saying is this, that God commended Moses to build a tabernacle and to bring in
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.240]   some great ceremonial, and amongst other things they had to take a beast and then
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.200]   put their hands upon the head of the beast, metaphorically transferring their
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:47.400]   sins to the beast, then kill him, take the blood, offer it to God at the altar.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:53.280]   That a lamb was to be slain morning and evening, never with any intermission in
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.880]   the whole of their history. All the types and the shadows and the prophecies, what's
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:10.120]   it all? Well, it's just to say this, that God is going to send his Christ, that God
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:15.400]   is going to provide a lamb, that God is going to provide an offering for sin.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:21.040]   He's taught them this in types and shadows, in analogies and illustrations,
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:25.560]   but he has told them all this is pointing to the one who's coming, the
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.400]   Lamb of God, and at last he appears and John the Baptist, the forerunner, stands
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:35.520]   and says to the people, "Look, behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.080]   the world, here's God's Lamb, here's the Lamb that's really going to do it. The
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.080]   blood of wolves and of goats and the ashes of an heifer can never cleanse the
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:48.640]   soul and the conscience from sin, but God's Lamb can. He's offered his own
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:55.680]   blood, the prophets prophesied it, and he has done it. All that he'd said by the
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:03.120]   mouth of his prophets that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled." Why did this
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:09.000]   have to happen? Peter tells them, "Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:21.240]   sins may be blotted out." That's why he died on that cross. The great problem
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:29.680]   confronting men is how can his sins be blotted out? All of us by nature are as
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:38.720]   we are because of our sins. They stand between us and God. And the great problem
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:44.360]   confronting all is how can a man be just with God? What can I do with my sins? My
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:48.640]   dear friend, have you faced that problem? You thought the problem was could you
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.960]   with your great intellect accept miracles? It isn't. Your problem is your
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:59.680]   sinfulness, the uncleanness of your mind, the uncleanness of your heart, the evil
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:05.240]   actions you've performed, your wrong relationship to God, your blasphemy
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.800]   against him, your arrogance in questioning him and in querying him.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:14.960]   That's your problem, your moral failure, your blindness, your darkness. You've
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.120]   sinned against him. You've taken his name in vain. You've broken his
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.160]   commandments. Your sins are heavy upon you, and if you die like that you go to
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:28.520]   perdition. How can you get rid of your sins? How can you blot them out? You can't.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:36.360]   There's only one way whereby that can be done, and it is the very thing that
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:42.240]   happened on the cross on Calvary's Hill. He is the Lamb of God that taketh away
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.160]   the sins of the world. Do you know what was happening there? God was laying on
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:53.480]   him the iniquity of us all. God was taking your sins and punishing them in
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:48:03.160]   him. His blood was shed that your sins might be blotted out. That's the answer,
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:10.520]   and it is the only answer and the only explanation. His own disciples warned him
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:14.640]   about going to Jerusalem. They said that Fox Herod is waiting to kill you, don't
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:19.560]   go there. He said his fear steadfastly to go to Jerusalem. They did their utmost to
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.840]   dissuade him. He said, "I must. I've come to do it. I've come into the world in
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:29.520]   order to do this, cost what it may. I've come to do it. This hour for which I've
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:38.920]   come, I must." As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:46.280]   the Son of Man be lifted up on a cross, that whosoever believeth in him should
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:53.480]   not perish, but have everlasting life. You see my friend, that's what Peter
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.880]   preached. That's what I preached tonight. What Peter was saying to them is this,
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   "Don't be interested in the miracle. Don't be interested in us. The question for you
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:06.640]   is this, do you realize that you killed the Prince of Life, the Son of God, the
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:11.640]   Savior of the world? Do you realize that you denied and rejected the only one that
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:18.880]   can save you? Repent, change your minds, believe in Him. And the moment you
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:26.040]   believe in Him, your sins will be blotted out. God will justify you and regard you
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:31.120]   as if you'd never sinned at all. He said that's the question. Do you see, my dear
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.640]   friends, you're thinking of the wrong problems, the wrong questions. The problem
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:40.720]   is you, a creature who's got to die at any moment and stand before God in the
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:46.520]   judgment, and His Christ who's been in this world will be confronting you. What
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:51.280]   did you believe about Him? What did you make of Him? What conclusion did you come
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   to Him with regard to Him and with respect to Him? Shall I end by putting it
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.920]   like this to you? There are only two views of the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:08.560]   ultimate analysis, only two. You either take man's view of Him or else you take
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:16.720]   God's view of Him. Look at the contrast. Man's view of Him is that He's only
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:27.440]   Jesus, a man like Paraphras. God's view of Him is that He's His dearly beloved,
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:36.520]   only begotten Son. The world cries, "He's only a man!" God speaks from heaven at the
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:40.440]   baptism and at the Mount of Transfiguration and again just before the
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:51.640]   end, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased." Which is it? Listen again,
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:58.080]   there's another contrast. Peter said, "You denied Him in the presence of Pilate when
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:04.200]   he was determined to let Him go. You denied the Holy One and the just and
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:13.240]   desired a murderer to be granted unto you." The world denies Him, denies Him as
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:20.960]   the Son of God, denies Him as the Lamb of God, denies Him as the Savior of the
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:27.400]   world who shed His blood that it might be forgiven. It denied Him and said, "Away
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:36.200]   with Him, crucify Him!" But what does God do? Listen, "The God of Abraham and of Isaac
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:46.700]   and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified His Son Jesus." The world denies
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:53.320]   Him, rejects Him. God has glorified Him. How did He do so? He glorified Him in His
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:59.960]   life. He spoke from heaven, authenticating Him. He gave Him power to work miracles,
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:05.560]   to teach. He glorified Him in His death. He said, "Here is one who's big enough and
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:10.640]   great enough and holy enough to bear the punishment of sins. He's my Lamb." God
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:21.200]   glorified Him, but above all He glorified Him in the glorious resurrection. Which
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:28.100]   have you done? Have you denied Him or have you glorified Him? But listen to
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:35.120]   another contrast. You denied Him, the Holy One and the just, and desired a murderer
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:41.300]   to be granted unto you, and killed the Prince of Life. The world killed Him. The
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.620]   world is always killing Him, killing Him metaphorically, killing Him by denying
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:53:00.260]   Him. "Away with Him," it says, "they killed Him." But God raised Him from the dead. Are
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:07.100]   you still killing the Son of God? Or are you looking unto Him in the glory and in
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:12.380]   the exultation, and bowing your knees before Him, and saying, "What wilt thou
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:17.340]   have me to do, Lord?" and ascribing all glory and power and dominion and might
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:22.060]   unto Him? You know, there's one extraordinary thing in this Sermon of
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:30.480]   Peter, and it is with this I end. So far I've shown you the utter and the
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:36.040]   complete contrast between the way men handled the Son of God and the way in
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:44.840]   which God himself handled Him. There's one amazing thing here. There is one thing
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:52.920]   that both men and God have done to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Do you
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:58.840]   know what that is? Listen. "The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:08.840]   God of our fathers, hath glorified His Son Jesus, whom you delivered up, and
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.560]   denied Him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let Him go."
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:20.920]   Delivered up! They did. They delivered Him up to death. And do you know that God
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:31.520]   did exactly the same thing? Listen to the Apostle Paul in Romans 8, 32. "He that
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:40.840]   spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all." The same word exactly.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:48.360]   There you're face to face with the heart of the Gospel. Men delivered Him up to
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:53.840]   death. Oh, but the message of the Gospel is this, that God delivered Him up to
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:55:04.400]   death for us all. God so loved the world that He gave, delivered up to the death
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:12.760]   of the cross, His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:20.320]   perish, but have everlasting life. The world doesn't understand the cross. It
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.320]   regards it as weakness, as failure, believes that even God has let Him down.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:29.080]   Can't you see it's the most glorious thing of all? God has so loved you that
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:33.760]   He's even put His Son there, sent Him to the cross, sent Him into the world to
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:41.640]   bear your sins. He's delivered Him up. "And has poured forth all His holy wrath
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:51.040]   against sin upon Him. He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:57.280]   all. How shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?" My dear
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:02.160]   friend, which position are you in? It's one or the other. Are you taking men's
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:10.080]   view of Him, or are you taking God's view? I press the question upon you for this
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:19.200]   reason, that it's a question you'll never get rid of, because you'll never get rid
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:24.120]   of Him. These people thought they'd got rid of Him. And here they come to examine
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.520]   a miracle. "No, no," says Peter, "you know what you're up against? You're up against the
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:37.480]   one you got rid of. He's back, He's here, He's acting. He always will." And you, my
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:44.040]   friend, are confronted tonight by this Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God. And you
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:51.000]   always will be. You'll be confronting Him on your deathbed. Oh, but much more
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.840]   important, He'll be confronting you beyond death, in the judgment eternal. The
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:02.160]   Son of God, He lives, He reigns, He's acting, He's done it. Can't you see Him in the
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:07.520]   miracle? Forget that, face Him. Why did He ever come? See, there's only one answer. He
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:14.160]   came to give His life for ransom for you. God delivered Him up for you. Whatever you
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:20.200]   may have been, whatever you may have thought of Him until this moment, do you
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:25.520]   see now that you've done it all in ignorance? Very well, repent and believe
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:34.880]   on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved. Amen.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
