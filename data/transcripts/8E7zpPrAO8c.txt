[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   What is God's good design in our suffering?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   What's he doing in us and for us and through us in our pain?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   These are the very questions every Christian will ask at some point.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   And these are the questions that were answered by Pastor John in a sermon exactly seven years ago today.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   The sermon was preached at Christ Community Church in Houston, Texas.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Kevin, a podcast listener who attends the church, has been trying to get me to play the following clip for about five years now.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Kevin, thank you for your persistence. Here it is.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Here's Pastor John in Houston seven years ago preaching on Romans 8, verses 12 to 17.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   No pain, no gain.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   No cross, no crown, no suffering, no inheritance.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   That's the way God has set it up.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   In other words, when it says in Romans 8, verse 23, "We're groaning."
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I would say all the groaning experienced on the path of obedience is what the suffering refers to in Romans 8, verse 17.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Because if you limit it to only hard things done to you from others because you're a Christian,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   you're missing a big piece of your suffering.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Every pain in your life, every frustration in your life, every conflict in your life,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   every difficulty in your life that you experience walking on the path towards the inheritance is suffering with and for Jesus.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Because it is being used by the devil to threaten your faith and used by God to strengthen your faith.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And if you will embrace it the way verse 17 says, it's your pathway to glory, God is triumphant and the devil is defeated.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I don't care if it's a stubbed toe on the way shopping.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   How you handle a stubbed toe in relation to God Almighty bears witness of your faith in His providence.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   If you're in His face, "I'm so down to get a stubbed toe, I asked another problem today, this is a bad day."
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Look, if you're not in hell, it's a good day.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Why would God ordain that the pathway to the inheritance be suffering and only suffering?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I mean there is no other path of suffering free access.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Doesn't mean everything on the path is suffering, you know that.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   We're sitting here in a very nice place and I'm feeling really good right now.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I have no stomach ache, no headache, no backache, I'm just, God is good, right?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I don't mean there aren't good things on the way, I mean there will be suffering.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of heaven, Acts 14.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   There's no other way.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Now why would that be? Why would God set it up that way?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Here's a clue from Romans 5, 3.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   "Not only this, but we also exult or rejoice in our tribulations,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance, or in other words, endurance."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Endurance of what? Faith.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   How does that work?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Every hardship, from the tiniest dubbed toe to the loss of a spouse, the loss of a child,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   from the smallest to the biggest, every hardship in your life is the kicking out from under you
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   of a prop that was supporting your happiness.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   You can either curse God or fall on God.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And God is kicking them for you to fall on Him.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Because that's what makes you strong.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Remember Paul in 2 Corinthians 1, verse 8?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   We were so unbearably crushed.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   We felt that we had received the sentence of death.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   That was to make us rely on God who raises the dead.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   God brought Paul to the brink of death for one reason.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   There was only one person to trust now. The God who raises the dead.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   All of our hardships are designed to make our faith stronger, to make us rely more on God.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   From the littlest to the biggest. That's why it's the pathway to glory.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   We've got to trust Him. Faith is the only way to heaven.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And tribulations serve our faith.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   If the Holy Spirit is testifying that He's your Father, if He's not, you get angry at God.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   "I don't want this anymore! I'm out of here! If this is the way the children get treated, I'm out of here!"
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You don't have the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   The Holy Spirit says, "Father, I need You. This is hard. This is really hard.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   But You're my Father and Jesus is my Lord.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   This is the pathway to the inheritance, so I'm all in. Help me!"
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   That's the way the Holy Spirit talks.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   So if you respond to hardship with, "I need a Father and Jesus is my Lord,"
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   the Holy Spirit is bearing witness with your spirit that you are the child of God.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   I'm going to close with a story from John Newton.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I come back to it over and over to convict myself of my murmuring.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Paul said in Philippians 2, "Do all things without murmuring."
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Is there any more condemning verse in the Bible?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   All things without murmuring.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Murmur, murmur, murmur.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So here's what happened.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   This is John Newton writing in the 18th century.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So there are no cars, there are only carriages.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So picture a horse-drawn carriage.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   A man is on the way to New York to get his inheritance.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Here's what happens.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   "Suppose a man was going to New York to take possession of a large estate."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Let's just say it's worth $5 million.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   "Suppose a man was going to New York to take possession of a large estate,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   and his carriage should break down a mile before he got to the city."
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   This is where we are in our walkway towards heaven.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   "Which obliged him to walk the rest of the way."
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   What a fool we should think him if we saw him wringing his hands
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   and blubbering out all the remaining mile,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   "My carriage is broken, my carriage is broken."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Because he's on the way to an inheritance worth millions of dollars.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   He can fix the carriage.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Here's my addition to the story.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Sometimes your kid falls over the cliff when the wheel comes off the carriage.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And you fall out of the carriage and so crush your knee,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   you never walk normal again on the mile that's left in your life.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   That happens.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I want to make light here of broken carriages.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   We all can laugh at a broken carriage.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Not as easy to say, "I lost my kid when he was 5, 21 of leukemia."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   I've buried so many kids.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   There's a whole, you know this, there's whole sections of woodlawn cemetery
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   with little teeny places.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And to see his dad carry a white box like this is a carriage that you don't make light of that's broken.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   But he can know for himself, for this child, for his wife,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   he can know just a mile, just a mile over the hill.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I get the child, I get the wife, I get the health, I get the world,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   I get a new car, I get a new body to enjoy it all.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And that's how his tears will not be the tears of those who have no hope.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   He will weep. We will weep.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   No, we won't weep as those who don't have an inheritance.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So, my prayer for you now is that God would awaken the witness of the Holy Spirit,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   and would call out Abba, Father, and causing you to hate the sin in your life
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   that murmurs against the Father, betrays the Father.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And if those two things are happening, the Spirit is speaking loud and clear into your life, your mind.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Powerful. That's a clip from Pastor John's sermon from October of 2013 in Houston
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   on Romans 8, verses 12 to 17.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   The sermon is titled "A Spectacular and Scary Promise."
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   You can get the entire recording right now at DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Kevin, thank you for your persistence in getting this clip shared with the APJ audience.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And if you have a favorite sermon clip of Pastor John's, send it to me.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   You'll only need to ask once, not multiple times like Kevin, I promise.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Give me the title of the sermon and the timestamps from the audio of when the clip begins and when it ends.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Tell me why it's impacted you.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Give me your name and the closest city to you, and email me all those details
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line if you would, please.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Speaking of questions, one of the great and most important questions of Calvinism
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   is over how God hardens hearts, like Pharaoh's heart.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Did Pharaoh harden his own heart first, or did God harden Pharaoh's heart first?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And how does this dynamic of self-hardening lead to divine hardening as it unfolds,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   even in our culture today, as we look at Romans chapter 1?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So, a really sharp question coming up next time with Pastor John back in the studio with me on Friday.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I'm Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   [ Silence ]
