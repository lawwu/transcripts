[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Podcast listener Victoria writes in to say this, "Hello, Pastor John. I often
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.480]   wonder how would you counsel someone who is addicted to approval, always fearful
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.560]   of what people might think of him or her, and always concerned over the slightest
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.000]   apathy from others, fearing rejection. What would you say to Victoria?"
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Well, I'd say the same thing to Victoria that I would say to me.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   [Laughter]
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Exactly.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   This is a totally universal problem, all right? This is not a small segment of
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   people who are wrestling with this isolated little problem. There is a
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   paradox, an irony in all of us in this regard. We crave approval from others, and
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   we fear rejection by others, which means that on the one hand, we desperately want
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   to be somebody, but on the other hand, by our craving and by our fear, we admit we
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   are dependent on others for the somebody that we want to be. There's a built-in
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   irony here. Put it another way. We want our worth, our strength, our beauty, our
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   accomplishments to be validated by others, and in the very moment of our
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   insecure craving and fearing, we are admitting we don't have much strength to
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   be validated, but instead we are weak and we need to be propped up by validation.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   My word, yes.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   What an irony. There's an incredible lesson here. In one sense, this craving for
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   approval and this fear of disapproval is both an indictment of the sin of pride
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and an expression of hope that if we're willing to admit it, we already know that
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   pride is a hopeless way forward. We already know this. We're given evidence to
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   it every day, and we need, we really need help from outside, and it isn't the
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   affirmation of other people. It's God. We are trying to convince ourselves that we
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   are okay without help from outside, ironically by seeking validation from
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   people outside who are all trying to do the same thing. But the real way to deal
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   with this craving and this fear of not getting it, not getting the affirmation,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   is to humble ourselves and to admit that our real security, our real identity, our
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   real stability, our real joy comes from way outside ourselves, namely from God,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   and our problem is that we have replaced God-centeredness with self-centeredness
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and God-focus with self-focus and God-regard for self-regard. And as I was
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   thinking about this, the quote from C.S. Lewis came up into my mind where—I think
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   this is in one of his letters. I didn't write down the location. I think it's a
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   letter where he says this, "The pleasure of pride is like the pleasure of
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   scratching. If there's an itch, one does want to scratch, but it is much nicer to
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   have neither the itch nor the scratch. As long as we have the itch of self-regard,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   we shall want the pleasure of self-approval. But the happiest moments are
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   those when we forget our precious selves and have neither but have everything else—
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   God, our fellow humans, animals, the garden, and the sky instead." Now that is a
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   beautiful statement, because what he's saying is if we would just give up our
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   hopeless self-preoccupation, we would inherit God as our treasure and the
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   whole world thrown in for good measure. Self-regard is a hopeless way to live.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   If we're getting our pleasure from feeling self-sufficient, we will never be
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   satisfied with others seeing and applauding our self-sufficiency. It will
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   never work, and we'll always be plagued by the fear that they've not seen it or
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   they didn't respond positively enough or what did that facial expression mean or
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   why didn't they call back or on and on and on. Oh, what a miserable life. We'll
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   always be second-handers. Our meaning in life, our joy, our identity, our worth
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   will be constantly dependent on other people, and that is a miserable way to
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   live. And so Jesus describes the Pharisees—boy, should this go home to all of us—
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   they do all their deeds to be noticed by men. Oh, in this media-driven age of
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   ours where you can tweet yourself out in a minute how we need this, they do all
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   their deeds to be noticed by men, and they love the place of honor at banquets
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   and the chief seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   marketplaces and being called by men "Rabbi." But evidently, there's a void.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   There's a void in this so-called self-sufficiency. Why? Because the self
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   was never designed to satisfy the self. It was never meant to be self-sufficient.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   We are only images of God. We're not God. We're not the ultimate thing. We are
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   shadows. We're echoes. So there'll always be an emptiness, an emptiness in our
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   soul that struggles to be satisfied with the resources of self and constantly
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   needs others to prop up the self, which can never happen because the self was
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   never designed to be that for the self. So here's the key problem and the way
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   out. The empty craving for the praise of others signals the absence of faith in
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   God's future grace, the absence of a restful satisfaction in all that God is
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   for us in Jesus, the absence of the outward look to God in Christ as our
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   meaning and our identity and our security and our worth and our usefulness.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And Jesus himself made the connection between faith in God or faith in Jesus
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and the opposite, namely craving for human praise. I remember years ago I was
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   just powerfully impacted by John 5:44 where Jesus says this, "How can you
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   believe when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   that comes from the only God?" Well, what's the answer? You can't. You can't
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   believe. Itching for glory from other people makes faith impossible. Why?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Because faith means being satisfied with all that God is for you in Jesus. And if
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   you are bent on getting your satisfaction from scratching the itch of self-regard,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   people's affirmation, you will turn away from Jesus because you can't serve two
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   masters. But if you would turn from self as the source of satisfaction, which is
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   what repentance is, and come to Jesus for the enjoyment of all that God is for us
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   in him, which is what faith is, then the itch would be replaced by a well of
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   water, springing up to eternal life. So my counsel to every Christian who
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   struggles with the fear of man's disapproval and the craving of man's
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   approval, which is all Christians more or less, is this. Realize that in Jesus
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Christ, in a solid God-chosen relationship with Jesus, man's disapproval
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   cannot hurt you, and man's approval cannot satisfy you. Therefore, to fear the
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   one and crave the other is sheer folly. You shall know the truth, and the truth
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   will set you free—free from the fear of not getting other people's approval and
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   craving it as though you just got to have it. And the truth that sets you free from
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   that is, if God is for us, who can be against us? Romans 8:31. You don't need to
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   fear anyone's disapproval when God Almighty is for you. Think about it. Let
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   it sink in. And the other truth is that knowing Jesus, looking outside ourselves
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   to the glory of the Son of God in the gospel, in the triumph for us over evil,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   looking to him is all-satisfying. I count everything as loss because of the
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   surpassing worth of knowing Jesus. So the itch is satisfied, not with successful
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   self-regard, but with the breathtaking Christ-regard.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Brilliant. What a quote from C.S. Lewis, and for what it's worth, that quote
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   appears in his Collected Letters, Volume 3, page 429. It also appears in John
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Pepper's book, Future Grace, in chapter 6. And for more information and to
