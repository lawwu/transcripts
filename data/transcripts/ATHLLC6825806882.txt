[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.280]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.080]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.840]   If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.980]   and today I'm talking with Matt Kepnes,
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.840]   better known as Nomadic Matt.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.220]   In the early 2000s, he accidentally became
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.840]   one of the OG travel bloggers after saving money,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.440]   quitting his job, and backpacking around the world.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.380]   For almost two decades, he's been traveling,
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.960]   writing about it, and sharing how traveler is easier,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.600]   cheaper, and more life-enriching than more people realize.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.920]   He wrote the New York Times bestselling
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.120]   "How to Travel the World" on $50 a day,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.540]   and later, after more than a decade of travels,
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.120]   he wrote a memoir called "10 Years a Nomad."
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.500]   We're gonna talk about why travel
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.320]   doesn't have to cost as much as you think,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.660]   how travel changes after doing it for as long as Matt has,
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.780]   what to do if you get burnt out on travel.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.080]   We'll get some of Matt's favorite tactics for travels,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.840]   and discuss whether $50 a day is really enough.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.700]   We'll also talk about why travel insurance
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.640]   is one of the most important elements of a good trip,
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.600]   which Matt knows firsthand from a crazy experience
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.560]   he'll share about getting stabbed abroad,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.880]   and a lot more than that.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.120]   So let's get started right after this.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.120]   I used to say I didn't think buying a second home
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.720]   was a good financial decision,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.280]   but then I discovered Fractional Vacation Home Ownership,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.360]   and I actually bought one with Picasso,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.960]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380]   Don't worry, this is not a timeshare pitch.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.640]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.440]   then creates an LLC for each home,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.960]   so you can buy as little as 1/8 of the property
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.280]   and have real ownership.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.560]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.360]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.680]   handling design, cleaning, maintenance,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.040]   bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.840]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.040]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560]   When we first heard about Picasso,
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.980]   it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.600]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.080]   toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.480]   Since then, it's truly become our second home,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.000]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.280]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.320]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.460]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.280]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.880]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.240]   And until the end of April,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.880]   you can own now and pay later with Picasso Now,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.280]   which lets you put only 5% down
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.600]   and get the complete Picasso experience for 12 months.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.840]   After that, you can pay the rest of the down payment
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.640]   and move to long-term ownership,
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.920]   apply your 5% to another Picasso home, or just walk away.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.260]   So, for a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.240]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.560]   where All The Hacks listeners
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.960]   will get a free Picasso Access account,
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.500]   which means you can see new listings
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.440]   before they go live on the website,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.640]   and up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.640]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso, P-A-C-A-S-O.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.760]   Matt, welcome to the show.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.600]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.480]   As always, it's fun to be here.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.960]   - Well, I have a lot of questions.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.920]   I'll special shout out All The Hacks member, Alyssa,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.840]   who sent in a ton of topics to discuss,
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.800]   but I wanna just start off asking
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.500]   what you think the biggest misconception
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.400]   people have about travel is.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.360]   - I mean, I think the obvious answer, at least to me,
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.720]   is that people think it's expensive.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.880]   I think less so now because so much is on social media,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.920]   and there's so many blogs, and it's talked about.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.360]   The vast majority of people will say,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.160]   "Well, they don't really have time to travel."
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.320]   But if you dig, there's always time,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.120]   but then they're like, "Oh, I just can't afford it,"
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.280]   because people think, "Oh, plane tickets
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.480]   "are expensive, hotels, Airbnb."
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.720]   They see all these commercials
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.260]   and this glamorized version of travel on social media,
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.940]   and they just think, "Well, that's pricing.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.340]   "Travel's a luxury item, right?
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.840]   "It's not a must-have thing.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.760]   "It's something you do to relax, to take a break."
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.240]   And so there's this perception that this is expensive,
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.240]   when it doesn't have to be because you always
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.880]   can go over to wherever you're going
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.520]   and just do the local things,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.640]   and the local things cost a non-touristy price.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.220]   If you ask people, like,
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.280]   "Well, how much do you spend on your own life?"
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.520]   people have these very way-off estimates.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.800]   They're on the lower end.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.760]   But if you get people to record all their expenses,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.820]   even like, "Oh, I bought a water bottle.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.280]   "That's a couple bucks, right?"
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.720]   Yeah, but you don't think about it.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.480]   People actually spend a lot more than they think they do,
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.640]   and then when you balance that
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.880]   versus the price of travel, it's oftentimes cheaper.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.860]   - I live in the Bay Area,
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.940]   so anywhere in the world I would go
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.440]   has to be probably cheaper, except maybe Tokyo.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.840]   Life other places is cheaper.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.320]   I experienced this actually,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.880]   it was probably almost 15 years ago.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.320]   We traveled for eight months,
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.560]   and we rented our place out at home,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   and we broke even or even came out slightly ahead
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.480]   because it turns out we were spending more
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.240]   to live in the Bay Area than we were spending to travel.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.720]   But I wanna get into some of those costs,
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.040]   some of the ways you save money,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.720]   some of the tactics you have,
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.320]   but I kind of wanna get started
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.340]   and just ask how travel has changed for you.
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.440]   I know you have been in this industry
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.840]   for longer than many,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.600]   and by industry I mean writing
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.960]   and sharing your travels online.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.040]   You wrote a memoir about what you've learned
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.560]   after being a nomad for a decade.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.320]   How have things evolved for you personally
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.680]   and in the industry?
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.040]   - I started this when I was 25.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.240]   I started traveling the world,
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.920]   and I'm 42 this year.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   And so obviously my days of cheap meals
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.360]   and 12-bed hostel dorms is long gone.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.400]   I like nice food.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.160]   Since I work when I travel,
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.360]   having a place to work is really important.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.240]   I haven't been getting a lot of good sleep is important,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.400]   so I tend to get my own room, hotels.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.560]   I take a lot more paid walking tours or food tours.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.200]   And so for me the biggest thing
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   is that my accommodation is a lot nicer,
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.160]   and I take more paid activities,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   whereas when I was 25 it was all about the free stuff,
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.520]   the hostel dorms, cooking your own meals.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.960]   I still consider myself a backpacker budget traveler.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.880]   You know, I take public transportation
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.120]   and love street food.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.680]   I still do parks and local things
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.720]   and go to the markets and all that jazz.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.200]   I'm not a resort guy.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.440]   I don't really do luxury.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.360]   I mean, it's nice, but it feels very isolating to me.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.240]   So that's the biggest thing that for me has changed
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.680]   is sort of probably the nicer digs.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.560]   And then how has travel changed?
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.800]   I think travel has become a lot more accessible
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   than when I started traveling,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.680]   both the ability to do it
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.120]   and the ability to find information.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.400]   When I started traveling,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.880]   the internet was just sort of taking off
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.200]   as a means of like finding information
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.480]   in the sense that you had like forums
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.800]   and like blogs and all these places
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.160]   you can go to ask questions about
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.520]   where do I find this hostel?
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.560]   How do I do this thing?
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.640]   And so I was still primarily using guidebooks
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.200]   as well as just asking around,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.880]   but between social media and the advent of so many blogs,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.080]   there's nothing you can't learn
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.280]   with a quick Google search.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.000]   There's no hidden restaurant, this hidden town.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.840]   Like, oh, have you been?
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.840]   Yeah, there are places that are more well-known
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.480]   than anywhere else,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.120]   but there's no place that's unknown
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.360]   in the age of the internet.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.480]   Somebody has been there
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.080]   and they posted an Instagram from there.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.440]   No matter like what little town it is,
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.800]   no matter where it is.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.880]   And so that is really great
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.120]   because it demystifies a lot of the travel experience.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.800]   It allows people to become more comfortable with going.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.600]   It's not so much of like you're going into the unknown.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.680]   It's like, oh, okay, I've heard of this place.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.560]   I've heard of this thing.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.840]   So maybe I'll go there.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.720]   Even if you're like so scared
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.920]   'cause you're going to a place you've never been,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.760]   it's no longer like this fog out there.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.120]   And then the advent of all these budget airlines
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.960]   and everything has made it just a lot cheaper
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.760]   for people to travel.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.720]   - Sometimes one of the ways that I get inspiration
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.960]   is I'll just search on YouTube
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.160]   and it's like, okay, well, what's this place like?
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160]   It's like, here's a video of a person
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.120]   walking down the street
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.000]   and you can get a really visceral feeling
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.120]   for what it's like to be there.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.520]   And I remember when we first went to South and East Africa,
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.320]   I had this one Brat travel guide that was from 1998
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.880]   because we were traveling for long enough
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.200]   that I couldn't bring a book for each country.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.840]   So I was like, this was the one.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.880]   You don't get a lot of feeling
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.520]   about what you're about to embark on there.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.040]   It was more of a directory.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.080]   And out of date, significantly.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   - Yeah.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.160]   Yeah, guidebooks, even in the best of times,
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.200]   are usually a year and a half behind what's going on.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.440]   I never have used guidebooks as a price guide,
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.560]   just more of a rough guide.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.520]   - I think they're great about here's the part of town
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.680]   to look for, here's some ideas of how transportation works.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.600]   But I'm curious, you said now that you've gotten older,
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.680]   have done this a while, your digs have gone up.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.760]   You wrote the book.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.560]   People have referenced it in many ways
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.280]   about being like the guide for backpacking,
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.160]   about traveling the world on $50 a day.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.360]   Do you think that still holds
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.240]   both in today's world inflation pandemic
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.560]   and as people age and want to experience travel
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.960]   not in a hostel with 12 beds?
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.800]   - Yes and no.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.160]   That book was never about the number.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.320]   A lot of people would get caught up on that.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.640]   Like, oh, 50 bucks.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.760]   Good luck doing Norway at 50 bucks.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.480]   You're traveling the world at $50 a day.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.800]   So it's a daily average.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.080]   Some places, totally.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.200]   Especially post COVID, strong dollar.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.760]   India is still very cheap.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.400]   Parts of Central America, Southeast Asia,
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.000]   Eastern Europe, still very cheap.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.920]   But your average place for a hostel in Western Europe
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.480]   is probably 30 euros now a night.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.680]   So it's very rare to see dorm beds, 10 euros, 15 euros.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.040]   They're still out there, but they're harder to find
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.120]   and they're less common.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.320]   And the beds are probably gonna be like 20 beds.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   And I am going to redo this book
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.440]   probably for a post COVID, post inflation world.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.960]   I'd probably up it to like a 65, $70 a day average.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.440]   If you're doing the quintessential round the world trip,
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.080]   going to Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand,
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.880]   South and Central America.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.720]   And if you're coming from the US,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.800]   that's going to be even better
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.600]   because the US dollar is so strong.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.680]   Will that stay?
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.520]   Who knows?
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.080]   When I planned my original trip around the world,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.520]   I remember it was one US dollar
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.280]   got you a $1.30 Australian.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.480]   So that's what my budget was based off of.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.200]   And by the time I got there, it was one-to-one.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   So I lost 30% of my budget because of that.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   I had to readjust everything.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.000]   So it's less about the number and more about the style,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.200]   like the tips and tricks.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.160]   If you're just looking for ways to travel cheap,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.480]   forget about the number,
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.440]   just use the strategies in the book.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.280]   - Okay.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.480]   So let's talk about some of those strategies
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.680]   'cause I liked how you actually broke it down.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.880]   It wasn't just, there are a bunch of strategies,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.920]   go have a great trip.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.080]   It's here's what you specifically need to know.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.760]   So how would you walk someone through
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.920]   the high level of planning a trip like this
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.760]   with the goal to do it on a budget?
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.240]   What are the kind of key strategies
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.440]   you think people need to follow?
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.840]   - I think the biggest thing for people is one, travel slow.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.560]   The more you can sort of spread out your costs,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.600]   the better it will be.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.800]   If you're moving around a lot,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.520]   you're gonna have high transportation costs
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.200]   and that really can eat into a lot of people's budgets.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.440]   But the big thing is just really being flexible
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.360]   because if you can wait for that deal to come,
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.640]   then you're not tied into like,
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.320]   I have to get this flight on this day to this destination.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.680]   One of the benefits of long-term travel
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.760]   is that you're in no rush to do anything.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.720]   You can wait for that flight deal, that hotel deal,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.000]   or you can find a flight deal or a hotel deal
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.520]   and be like, that's where we're going next
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.400]   because that's where it's cheapest.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.320]   And so big picture, always be flexible.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.640]   Second big picture thing is to travel like you live.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.280]   You in your daily life cook food,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.600]   you don't eat expensive food all the time, restaurants,
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.120]   you look for free activities,
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.520]   you take public transportation, you go for walks.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.660]   Do the same when you travel.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.320]   If you really wanna get a taste of local life,
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.120]   go to the local farmer's market,
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.680]   go take the train or the bus,
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.760]   go for a walk, sit in a park.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.520]   Travel doesn't always have to be about doing things.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.480]   It can be more about just existing in a place
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.440]   and soaking up the vibe.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.980]   And so if you travel like you live,
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.660]   you're gonna end up doing all the things that locals do
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.160]   because what people do in Berlin
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.480]   isn't different than what people do in the Bay Area or Austin.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.740]   Everyone gets up and goes to work and takes a train
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.220]   and goes grocery shopping and lives their day-to-day life
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.820]   and then walks and maybe sits by the river.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.820]   They do something, sit in the park, do those things.
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.780]   - Let's pause for a second
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.280]   and go back to a kind of more macro question.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.860]   When it comes to travel, why do you love travel?
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.500]   What is it about travel that makes it something
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.520]   that you've now, I guess,
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.780]   dedicated your entire professional career to
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.020]   and something you've spent decades of your life doing?
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.220]   - I don't like to be bored.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.340]   I guess that's one reason.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.660]   When you're traveling, you're always doing something.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.220]   I like mastering my own time.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.700]   I mean, this is an accidental career.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.860]   The goal was never to start a company.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.860]   It was just to keep traveling for as long as possible
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.500]   so that I could have my own time, have my own schedule,
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.020]   do everything I wanted to do,
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.300]   just get out there and go explore and see the world.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.300]   The world is a book, right?
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.700]   But the world is also a puzzle.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.740]   And every place you go to adds one more piece.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.900]   It's an unsolvable puzzle.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.740]   You'll never finish it in your lifetime,
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.620]   but you just keep adding more to it.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.780]   I just find people interesting.
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.380]   I'm also deeply interested in history and politics.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.780]   And so going over to places
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.740]   and learning about why they do things
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.500]   is just fascinating to me.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.620]   - It sounds like a lot of those things
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.060]   aren't always the paid tour, the Michelin star meals.
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.340]   Finding the joy of travel
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.780]   that isn't what you saw on Instagram,
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.980]   I think can often make for the experience.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.900]   So I'm curious,
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.460]   when you're trying to find those experiences,
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.420]   when you're trying to meet people,
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.460]   what do you do to connect with people?
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.740]   I think in today's world,
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.780]   people are maybe a little more closed off
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.020]   than they were 20 years ago
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.420]   because they have their phone to distract them at a bar.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.260]   It seems harder to meet people.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.100]   Have you found ways to keep that kind of vibe going,
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.780]   especially now that you're not in the hostel,
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.460]   you might be in your own private room?
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.460]   - Well, one of the reasons I still love hostels
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.500]   is even though I'm in my own private room,
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.780]   I'm in a hostel, you still get the vibe, right?
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.620]   So you can still go to the common area.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.900]   I think the opposite is actually true.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.020]   I think the internet has made it easier to meet people.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.020]   True, people are glued to their phone,
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.940]   especially in the hostel,
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.940]   in a way that wasn't true in 2006 when I started traveling.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.380]   But there's so many apps and ways to meet people
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.820]   through couch surfing, social media,
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.460]   Instagram, Facebook groups, BumbleBFF, meetup.com,
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.180]   walk-in tours, bar crawls.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.060]   Like there's lots of ways to meet people
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.020]   and the internet has actually made it easier to meet people
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.780]   if you're open to it.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.100]   And I think people are a lot more open
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.620]   to just meeting a stranger online.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.860]   It's not weird to like,
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.220]   oh, there's a cool meetup happening.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.420]   I'm just gonna walk over to it 'cause I'm new here.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.500]   - Is there any kind of mental checklist
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.100]   or things you do before you're going to a new place
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.220]   to try to connect with people, figure out what to do?
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.820]   What resources do you use to kind of crowdsource ideas
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.460]   of things that you might spend your time on?
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.220]   I know you do say leave a lot of your time open
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.700]   for serendipity, so maybe the answer is none,
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.980]   but I'm curious what kind of research you do in advance.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.420]   - Very little, maybe read a couple of blog posts,
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.340]   bookmark a few restaurants.
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.900]   I try to just go there and see where the day takes me.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.660]   Instagram, my Twitter feed.
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.740]   If I'm in the mood to meet people,
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.820]   like in the sense that like,
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.180]   I want to actively like make sure there's people around me,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.780]   I'll either stay at a hostel
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.060]   or I'll look at like a expat Facebook group
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.860]   or meetup.com or something
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.700]   and see what's going on while I'm there.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.900]   Since I travel a lot for work,
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.060]   and so like my travels are about like
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.660]   getting the price of food
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.460]   because we have to write a guide to it.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.500]   It really depends on like,
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.860]   am I there for research purposes or am I there for fun?
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.300]   So if I'm there at a destination,
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.940]   'cause we're gonna write about it,
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.380]   I have a mission, I stick to it.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.340]   Yeah, you know, if I chat up locals
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.620]   and they're like, "Come to this thing."
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.780]   I'll be like, "Okay, sure."
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.340]   But like my mind isn't like,
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.900]   "I'm gonna go join this group
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.860]   to like see if there's like a cool event going on."
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.580]   But if I'm there for fun, I most likely will do that.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.300]   - Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.700]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.580]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.740]   for a good hang.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.820]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.780]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.700]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.660]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.420]   take care of the supplies.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.260]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.100]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.500]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.500]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.980]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.060]   that you got through another week.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.140]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.700]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.460]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.540]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.220]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.780]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.760]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.780]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.620]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.700]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.340]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.820]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.460]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.740]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.760]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.000]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.120]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.620]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.220]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.860]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.240]   as you build your wealth.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.520]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.380]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.520]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.580]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.020]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.420]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.380]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.700]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.820]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.180]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.900]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.700]   are first generation wealth,
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.780]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.940]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.260]   and learn from each other
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.860]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.140]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.480]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.900]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.040]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.520]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.960]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.600]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.060]   So many of these conversations
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.280]   aren't happening anywhere else online,
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.960]   so if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.800]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.960]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.040]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.300]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.700]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.640]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.720]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.120]   Any memorable experiences that have come
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.680]   from random joining things
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.640]   that you just found on the internet?
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.480]   - I joined a couple of couchsurfing groups
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.600]   when I lived in Paris a few years back,
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.640]   and those people became my friends
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.000]   for the entire time I lived there.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.320]   Back in the day, during the MySpace era,
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.240]   I met a bunch of people in a Thailand travel group,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.200]   and we ended up traveling around Southeast Asia
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.480]   for like three months together, so that was fun.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.000]   - Our travels were at a similar time in life,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.120]   and it was the Lonely Planet forums.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.200]   - Yes, yeah. - Where we would just post,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.480]   "Hey, we're in South Africa."
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.240]   We ended up meeting these two guys from Sweden,
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.200]   and we ended up renting a car, buying a tent,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.280]   and all this stuff together,
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.680]   and we basically camped in a tent with them
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.840]   driving around Namibia, Botswana,
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.320]   and South Africa for three weeks,
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.560]   so I think that's still possible.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.040]   It just sounds like you gotta find
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.760]   a few different places to find people.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.560]   - Yeah, we do events here in Austin,
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.360]   and somebody came to one and said,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   "Oh, how long have you been reading the blog?"
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.240]   'Cause I just assumed they had come 'cause I was there,
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.120]   and it's part of our blog thing.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.400]   And she was like, "I just found this event on Eventbrite.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.840]   "I don't know what this is."
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.520]   And I was like, "Oh, that's really cool."
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.360]   She's like, "I'm just passing through."
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.960]   And I was like, "Super, well, welcome."
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.800]   - I remember after six or so months,
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.080]   I kind of was ready for something different,
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.480]   and we were doing some slow travel.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.000]   I'm curious, you did it for a decade.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.120]   What did you do to avoid getting burnt out about travel?
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.120]   - It's impossible not to get burnt out.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.680]   You will get bored at some point.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.040]   You will get tired, you will get burnt out.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.760]   If you're just doing long-term travel,
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.360]   it becomes your day-to-day life, right?
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.320]   And eventually, you need a break from that.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.080]   In your day-to-day life, you take a break,
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.000]   you go on vacation.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.200]   If travel life, you kind of just sit in one place
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.600]   and recharge your battery.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.600]   Travel is a battery.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.720]   It's not some unlimited wellspring of energy.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.480]   You need to rest at some point
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.360]   because everywhere you go,
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.800]   you have to relearn how to live, the language,
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.360]   how to get around, where to eat, where to stay,
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.760]   local customs, the streets.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.120]   You're relearning life every day,
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.960]   and it's mentally very taxing.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.680]   There's a reason why when you drive to work all the time,
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.720]   you can tune out because it becomes like a routine.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.600]   Your mind just goes on autopilot.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.440]   When you're traveling, there is no autopilot
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.720]   because you're relearning everything.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.600]   And so eventually, you're just burnt out.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.800]   You need a break.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.600]   Slow travel can really help that
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.080]   because you're not really rushing yourself a lot.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.360]   You're adjusting to new places at a slower pace,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.640]   but even the slowest of travelers,
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.040]   eventually, you're just like, "I just want to sit."
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.880]   - Even short trips, I found, can be a lot.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.760]   And so sometimes it feels so counterintuitive
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.360]   to spend an afternoon on a one-week trip,
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.440]   like watching a movie in your hotel room.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.200]   But the amount of energy you can recharge
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.680]   by just hanging out and relaxing,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.120]   I think, is really valuable.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.280]   And so I think people very often think,
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.240]   "Oh, I'm in this country.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.640]   "I can't afford to not be doing something every second
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.480]   "of every day."
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.760]   But sometimes you start to lose the appreciation for it
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.080]   if it feels like it's painful and it's work.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.960]   So don't be afraid to take a break,
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.920]   even on a week-long trip, for an afternoon.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.720]   - Yeah, and if your goal is to go to Italy for a week
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.400]   and soak in Italian culture,
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.320]   spending an afternoon doing nothing
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.800]   is very much a part of Italian culture.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.720]   Go sit at the piazza and just enjoy a cafe
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.960]   and just sit around and chat and people-watch.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.080]   They get a real sense of Italy that way.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.600]   - You mentioned customs
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.880]   and all the learning of a new place.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.600]   I've had a few questions from listeners
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.480]   that ask about going to places that are very unfamiliar,
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.320]   whether it's the customs or the language.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.160]   I'm curious what advice you have to someone.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.880]   Maybe they're going somewhere in the Middle East
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.480]   or in Asia where the customs and the language
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.440]   are all totally foreign to them.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.760]   What would you tell them to do either in advance
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.320]   or just to help them understand
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.200]   how it might not be as difficult as they might think?
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.440]   - Read a book.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.920]   You can't really know a place
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.400]   until you've read something about it.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.480]   So I always find reading up about where you're visiting,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.440]   a history book if you can,
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.560]   or even just like a current events book,
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.240]   something that just sort of gives the insight
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.840]   into the local culture can be super helpful.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.960]   Additionally, like there's so many blogs out there
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.280]   in the world these days
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.760]   that you can read like on any subject you want.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.400]   And from local writers too.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.120]   So like people that live in destination
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.680]   are now local bloggers.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.120]   That can really help you get a sense of place
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.960]   and understanding.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.160]   Also a great way to get food recommendations too.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.000]   If you find a local food blogger on Instagram,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.200]   their audience is other locals, not tourists.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.440]   So you're gonna get all of like the inside info.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.360]   - If you have a VPN
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.880]   and you can connect to an IP in the country,
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.080]   or maybe you can change your Google search to that country,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.560]   you might get a different set of results
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.880]   than if you're searching for a US IP
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.600]   or on like Google US search.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.480]   So I've sometimes found a better set of results
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.040]   when I'm searching for stuff online.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.520]   Maybe there's a local search engine even,
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.840]   but if you could try to anchor yourself
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.880]   to searching within the country,
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.120]   you get maybe more relevant topics
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.800]   than the kind of travel guide from the foreigners overseas.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.480]   I know one thing that I've heard you talk about
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.680]   maybe more articulately than I can is about communication.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.560]   And I think so many people might assume
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.760]   that you need to speak a language to go lots of places,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.320]   especially if you wanna go off the beaten path.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.360]   And so first I'm gonna ask,
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.200]   how many languages do you actually speak
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.320]   given that I think you've probably been to,
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.720]   if not a hundred, close to a hundred countries, I'm guessing.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:36.200]   - I speak pretty good Spanish, decent Thai,
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.280]   and I can understand and read French,
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.080]   though my ability to give a reply was very slow.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.120]   - But that hasn't held you back
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.040]   from going to plenty of countries
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.280]   that don't speak those languages?
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.480]   - Oh yeah, English is pretty widely spoken,
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.960]   at least basic English.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.160]   Even if you're going off the beaten path, sign language.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.840]   Everyone kind of knows the universal
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.160]   like cluck cluck for chicken, choo choo for train.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.840]   People want to help you,
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.400]   and so you just gotta give them that opportunity
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.440]   to just be like, this is what I need.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.640]   Most communication is nonverbal anyway,
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.760]   based on like your facial expression
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.840]   or like how you're miming things or body language.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.200]   That can really help people figure out what you need.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.280]   So never be afraid,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.040]   and there's always Google Translate now.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.960]   So like worst case scenario,
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.680]   you open your phone and you type in
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.680]   and it kind of gives like a okay translation,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.880]   but probably enough to get your point across to people.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.920]   - Does it ever feel like cheating to you a little bit,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.680]   having been to the type of travel
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.120]   where you had to rely on so much intuition
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.560]   or kind of hard work to communicate with people
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.560]   that didn't speak the language that now it's like,
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.000]   well, I guess I could just pull out my phone
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.640]   and type something and it'll be understood by someone
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.280]   that has no common language threads.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.360]   How do you feel about this?
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.920]   - I don't like it simply because
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.160]   I don't like pulling out my phone.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.160]   In some parts of the world,
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.160]   that's not always the wisest thing to do.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.040]   So I'd rather just do it the old fashioned way,
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.320]   but I'm an old fuddy duddy, so.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.400]   I mean, if there was like an earpiece that did it,
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.880]   I would probably get that earpiece.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.080]   Like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.840]   where they put that slug in his ear
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.640]   and he can understand like everything,
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.520]   that's what I would probably do.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.120]   But I don't like pulling out my phone a lot
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.760]   'cause then you're always on your phone
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.920]   and it's like back and forth.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.440]   You know, it slows down conversation.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.280]   - You mentioned earlier that now
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.080]   you like to stay in places by yourself,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.640]   but you also like to go on a lot more tours
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.480]   that cost money.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.360]   How do you find them?
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.920]   How do you make sure you don't get caught up
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.440]   in terrible tours designed for tourists?
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.360]   Are there review sites?
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.840]   How do you think about that?
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.320]   - I do mostly like day walking tours
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.240]   or a free tour or something like that.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.440]   Very rarely do multi-day trips,
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.360]   but Best Walking Tour in X
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.840]   is really a pretty good search term.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.800]   I'll read a couple of blog posts
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.280]   and if the same company appears in a couple
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.120]   and their tours look good and reasonably priced,
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.080]   I'll probably pick them.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.520]   You know, you can see star rating.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.600]   So like 17,000 people on TripAdvisor are like,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.960]   this is four stars.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.760]   And then like three writers on blogs are like,
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.240]   I took this tour and it was really good
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.960]   and I wasn't paid to say that.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.880]   And you're like, okay, maybe it's pretty good.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.200]   - It's always good to look for the,
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.160]   my unbiased opinion of,
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.520]   I find that to be a helpful search term
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.640]   for almost any product.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.640]   You're like unbiased opinion, XYZ mattress.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.760]   Is there any place you've been
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.440]   where you've actually found that
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.160]   just sign language and English weren't enough?
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.840]   And to be clear, when we say sign language,
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.160]   we're not talking, you know,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.880]   ASL, professional sign communication.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.440]   We're talking to more hand miming and gestures,
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.920]   but are there places you've found
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.080]   that it's actually been very difficult
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.960]   to get around and communicate?
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.200]   - No, not really.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.520]   Maybe I haven't been to enough places
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.240]   that are like so off the beaten path,
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.160]   but I've always found that miming
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.760]   and like sign language gets you far enough.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.480]   - I wanna go back to some of the tactics,
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   especially around what you travel with.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.720]   I know you're a fan of a backpack,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.680]   but nowadays what are the things that you take on every trip?
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.720]   Not the obvious things.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   I'm sure you bring a toothbrush,
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.360]   but what are the things that people might be packing
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.120]   that are different from how you pack?
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.400]   - I honestly don't take much stuff with me
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.920]   because I started at a time where you didn't need a lot.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.520]   And so if I ever need something, like an umbrella,
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.520]   I'll buy it.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.840]   Or if I need medicine, I'll pick it up on the way.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.200]   I definitely take a towel,
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.680]   Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 101.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   I always have a towel,
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.360]   but honestly don't take much stuff.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.040]   I mean, I'm not a photographer,
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.320]   so I just use my phone,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.200]   but to me, less is more.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.960]   Like what do you need to take?
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.640]   A couple of clothes, a couple of books,
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.280]   phone charger, and your phone.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.280]   And I take my computer.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.680]   I take a notebook to journal, backup credit cards,
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.640]   and that's really it.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   I take a flashlight.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.240]   I think a lot of people underestimate the power
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   of having a flashlight,
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.080]   especially if you're camping a lot
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.640]   or just out in rural areas often,
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.280]   just having that with you is really good.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.400]   But other than that, I don't take a lot of gear.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.720]   I'm like anti-gear.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.360]   I'm also anti-app.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.560]   If you're always like, "What apps do you use?"
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.960]   I'm like, "Google Maps."
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.400]   That's it.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.520]   Like, you don't need anything else.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.680]   Get off your phone.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.760]   Like, put down your phone.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.600]   Use it less.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.640]   You don't need it.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.000]   - You mentioned backup credit cards.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.640]   We could go probably for a while about travel hacking,
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.440]   but one area I haven't really talked about
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.560]   is how much do you think about banking and budgeting
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.080]   and that aspect of it for a long-term trip
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.480]   where you're gonna need to access money
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.040]   and you need to pay bills?
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.800]   Do you do anything differently than you would
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.880]   if you were living stateside?
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.280]   - So, like, I'm in this unique position
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.880]   where, like, I work and travel,
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.480]   so, like, money comes in
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.560]   and it's all tax write-off for me.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.840]   So I will say that my recommendation for people
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.760]   is always to have two bank accounts.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.280]   Like, if you're an American,
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.520]   you should definitely have the Charles Schwab ATM card.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.520]   There are no bank fees, no ATM fees,
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.200]   and if you get charged an ATM fee,
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.480]   they will reimburse your ATM fee.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.200]   So I always have money there.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.880]   That's my primary card when I travel.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.400]   And if you lose it, they'll basically
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.240]   FedEx it to you anywhere in the world within 48 hours.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.960]   But it's always good to have a backup
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.440]   just in case that gets hacked or something happens
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.880]   where you can't get it in 48 hours.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.720]   So I always carry two, two ATM cards
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.480]   and at least two credit cards.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.400]   Like, I'll carry more than two credit cards
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.720]   just 'cause I'm an avid travel hacker.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.760]   I only ever go out with one.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.400]   I only take my ATM card out very rarely.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.080]   It's always home and just the cash out that you need.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.560]   But that varies by destination.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.200]   You know, like, I mean, in Japan,
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.680]   you can walk around with $10 million in your pocket
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.880]   and no one's gonna do anything.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.240]   Versus, like, I wouldn't walk around Columbia
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.160]   with, like, a bunch of money or plastic in my pants.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.800]   But at least definitely those two.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.920]   And for the primary account that I have
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.720]   in terms of the Charles Schwab card,
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.680]   I only keep a few thousand dollars in there.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.000]   So if somebody were to, like, kidnap me
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.920]   and say, "Take all the money out,"
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.480]   it's not gonna drain everything.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.960]   There's only a maximum amount they can take.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.800]   - What about passport?
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.720]   Are you bring the passport with you
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.640]   when you're out and about
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.720]   or leave it back in the hotel or hostel?
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.600]   - I always leave it in the hotel or hostel.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.640]   - I know I've heard varying opinions here,
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.800]   which is, like, you always wanna have some form of ID
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.840]   if something happens, if you get in trouble.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.000]   And then the other is, like,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.640]   you definitely don't wanna have your passport
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.560]   lost, dropped, stolen while you're out.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.280]   - I bring my driver's license with me everywhere I go
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.440]   as a form of ID.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.880]   Passport stays inside.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.400]   The only time I will break that rule
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.040]   is if it's required for, like, a spot check on the train.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.280]   Sometimes in Europe, if you're on a train,
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.680]   even if you're just, like, going between cities,
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.960]   there'll be, like, a spot check.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.560]   But, like, just going out to, like,
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.680]   the bar or a restaurant or walking around, no.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.720]   And if I were to ever get stopped by the police
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.480]   and they're like, "Where's your passport?"
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   And I'd be like, "It's at my hotel.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.600]   "Let's go get it."
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.080]   I guess, like, if you were in a country
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.280]   that required it and, like, you got stopped
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.960]   and there was a lot of corruption,
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.800]   you may have to pay a bribe.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.000]   But nobody wants that paperwork.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.360]   Like, "Oh, why'd you arrest this guy?
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.560]   "He didn't have his passport on him."
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.920]   It's a lot of paperwork for nothing.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.400]   The universal rule is cops never wanna do paperwork.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.200]   And every country has paperwork.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.160]   The best will get a warning.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.240]   At the worst, they'll pay a fine, like a bribe.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.560]   - A fine. (laughs)
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.840]   With AirQuest. - Whatever you wanna call it.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.760]   - Been in any of those situations?
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.600]   - No.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.960]   - Where you've had to pay a fine/bribe?
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.400]   - Nope, never.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.800]   - Our only one was border crossing from Syria into Lebanon.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.720]   And the taxi driver, funny enough,
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.440]   he was so embarrassed that his country
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.400]   would be the kind of place where you had to pay a fine
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.680]   that he paid the fine out of his own fare
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.240]   because he didn't want us to know about it.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.600]   But we were in the car for a few hours.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.440]   We asked about it.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.040]   And he was like, "Yeah, the way this works is
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.680]   "if you get to the border and you have foreigners
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.160]   "and you don't pay a tip,
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.640]   "then they just hold you here for hours.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.480]   "And that causes delays for me and you.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.000]   "And our country's terrible at doing this stuff,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.840]   "but I'll do it."
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.360]   So I've never had to do it myself.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.000]   But I know the paperwork issue deeply
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.120]   because my wife was pulled over speeding in Bosnia.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.080]   And they were sitting here like, "Oh, this is the fine."
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.640]   And she was like, "Oh, I don't know."
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.760]   We just waited it out.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.960]   And eventually they were like, "Yeah, you can go
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.240]   "because we're not gonna try to fill out this paperwork
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.720]   "for your international driver's license and everything."
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.200]   I wish I could say I'm eating
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.240]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.000]   but the reality is that I'm not.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.880]   So I love having an easy way
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.000]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.680]   which is why I kickstart every day
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.600]   with AG1 from Athletic Greens.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.160]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.680]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.440]   because I think it's the best option
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.320]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.040]   You take one scoop of AG1
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.760]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.040]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.020]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.480]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.640]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.700]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.220]   and energized for the day,
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.740]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.480]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.520]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.300]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.360]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.240]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.720]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.600]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.240]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.880]   to take ownership over your health
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.900]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.160]   This year, I'm excited to learn as much as I can
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.660]   from the world's best minds,
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.680]   and an amazing way I do that is with Masterclass,
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   where you can learn anytime, anywhere,
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.120]   and at your own pace,
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.720]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.240]   With over 180 classes from a range
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.980]   of world-class instructors,
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.640]   that thing you've always wanted to do
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.280]   is closer than you think.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.240]   Seriously, I feel like every time
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.380]   I wanna learn something new,
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.800]   I can find a class on that topic
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.720]   from one of the best in the world.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.040]   Wanna negotiate better?
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.880]   FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss' class is amazing.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.980]   Wanna be funnier?
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.720]   Steve Martin and Judd Apatow
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.400]   both have great classes teaching comedy.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.600]   Or maybe you just wanna dive
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.560]   into the science of better sleep?
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.720]   Well, Matt Walker is the best in the world,
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.480]   and he has a class as well.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.460]   I could go on and on,
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.760]   so you'll just have to take a look yourself,
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.200]   because the depth of knowledge the instructors have
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.760]   and the quality of the experience is so good.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.600]   I highly recommend you check it out.

[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.840]   One thing we haven't talked about
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.160]   that I know you have a pretty strong opinion on
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.440]   is travel insurance.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.600]   What perspective do you have on travel insurance
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.560]   and its necessity in a day where so many credit cards
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.240]   have lots of forms of insurance baked into them?
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.680]   I still think it's very important
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.080]   just 'cause you get better medical care,
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.880]   like emergency care.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.680]   It's really the only higher-end premium credit cards
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.480]   with $600 a year, kind of the top-end ones,
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.920]   but you get really robust travel insurance.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.160]   But even then, these aren't travel insurance companies.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.720]   The credit cards tacking this on,
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.120]   they're not really streamlined to process claims
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.360]   in a way that a company whose only purpose
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.720]   is travel insurance.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.560]   A lot of these credit cards
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.400]   don't really cover good medical evacuation.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.920]   And so if you just want protection on trip interruption
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.480]   or cancellation or something gets stolen,
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.120]   the credit card you paid that trip on
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.720]   is probably good enough.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.320]   But if you want actual medical insurance
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.000]   in case something goes wrong,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.120]   you're gonna want something to pay extra for.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.320]   And travel insurance isn't that expensive.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.800]   So it's like, you're not paying like hundreds of bucks
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.880]   a month, like you get plans for 50 bucks.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.560]   Are there any providers you've used
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.480]   or what do you use when you travel?
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.360]   I use a company called Safety Wing.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   They're really good.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.320]   World Nomads is also really good.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.760]   For people having more gear,
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.920]   Insure Nomads is really good, but pretty expensive.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.520]   And then for seniors,
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.480]   I would definitely recommend Insure My Trip
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:56.920]   because not a lot of plans cover people over 70.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.600]   Okay.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.400]   Have you ever had to use travel insurance?
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.280]   I used it in Columbia.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.880]   I've used it in South Africa when my bag got stolen.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.320]   I've used it in Thailand.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.440]   So yeah, I've used it quite a number of times.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.520]   It's coming very handy.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.600]   It's coming handy for friends.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.560]   I had a friend break their back in the Amazon
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.960]   and they had to get airlifted out
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.040]   and then sent back to Canada
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.240]   and travel insurance covered the whole thing.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.080]   Wow.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.000]   I think it's so funny we get caught up
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.800]   in thinking travel insurance is about my flight got canceled
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.960]   but it can be about a lot of other things.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.200]   I don't know what kind of medical situations
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.680]   you've ever been in overseas.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.240]   They don't end up being that expensive
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.560]   unless they're very extreme.
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.000]   And I can assure you that an airlift
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   from South America to Canada
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.240]   is not something you want to have to cover on your own.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.360]   No, no.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.920]   That you do not.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.320]   That you do not.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.080]   Any situations you've ever been in,
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.160]   I think sometimes people think,
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.360]   oh, if I have a bad situation,
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.120]   I'll never want to travel again.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.160]   I assume you've been in a situation
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.120]   that might scare other people away.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.480]   And I'm curious how it affected how you travel
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.920]   and how or why it didn't stop you from keeping going.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.840]   Yeah, you know, I got stabbed in Columbia
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.200]   and my mother always sends me
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.880]   like every state department warning about Mexico.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.800]   But it's like, hey, we live in the States.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.440]   People get gunned down going to Walmart.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.560]   There are mass shootings all the time in this country.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.720]   Bad things happen.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.720]   It's just part of life.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.680]   It doesn't matter if you're home or in Mexico
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   or in Thailand or in Paris or in Japan,
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.200]   shit happens.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.600]   You can live in fear and say,
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.240]   oh, I'm just gonna never go anywhere.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.440]   But then you walk across the street to a movie theater
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.600]   and then you don't make it out because some psychopath.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.640]   Or you get hit by a car on your way to work.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.160]   Are you really gonna live in fear about every what if?
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.240]   If so, then like never leave your house.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.080]   If you're up for it,
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.240]   I'd love to hear the story in Columbia.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.320]   And maybe from the perspective of,
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.240]   I think a lot of people don't really plan for that.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.200]   And so they don't know what they would do
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   in that circumstance.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.960]   And I imagine, you know, you're here now.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   So it all went well.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.400]   How did you know what to do and where did you end up going?
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.280]   And how did the trip unfold after that?
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.800]   Yeah, I was in Bogota.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.720]   I had my phone out and long story short,
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.400]   you shouldn't have fancy electronics out.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.080]   I just forgot to put it back in before I left this cafe.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.320]   And someone tried to take it and he jerked backwards
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.200]   instead of just going forward.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.960]   So like we started tussling and then yeah,
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.880]   he had a small little knife.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.200]   I thought it was just punching me.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.600]   I mean, if he had like shown the knife,
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.680]   I would have been like, oh, take the phone.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   But afterwards I was like, oh, so sore.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.280]   And I was just covered in blood.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.160]   That's 'cause like he was stabbing me.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.600]   Luckily it was a small box cutter.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.080]   So it wasn't very big.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.520]   I assume you went to the hospital and everything was fine.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.720]   Yeah, the whole thing cost me like 50 bucks.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.720]   The flight home was like a thousand bucks.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.440]   And I asked for reimbursement for that.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.520]   But the 50 bucks, I was like,
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.040]   that's not worth the paperwork.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.160]   And they could have done it for 50 bucks,
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.120]   but I did it for the flight.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.680]   Would you go back to Bogota after that?
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.600]   Oh yeah, 100%.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.920]   I love Bogota.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.280]   I was really sad to have to go home.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.520]   I've also been to Bogota.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.440]   It's just a great place.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.040]   I love the country of Columbia.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.200]   I've been there a few times.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.240]   Bogota is close enough and time zone good enough
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.080]   that I think you could even do it in a long weekend
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.000]   and have a great trip.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.200]   I don't wanna not do slow travel,
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.720]   but I think for those who don't have the time to do it,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.520]   it's still a place that you can go
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.120]   in a short period of time because of the proximity.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.360]   It's such a phenomenal place.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.600]   I was there for six weeks
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.920]   and gonna stay in another six weeks.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.840]   I wanna just get some quick thoughts on travel hacking.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.920]   I've obviously covered this topic a ton.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.640]   You've thought about it a lot.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.520]   Are there perspectives you have on it
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.960]   that you think are maybe a little bit contrarian
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.400]   to the average person who plays the points and miles game
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.840]   that would be helpful to hear?
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.400]   I think that people get too caught up in point value.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.080]   Just for most people, just get a card,
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.280]   book your flight, that works,
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.560]   and don't spend time doing it.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.080]   People overcomplicate the simple.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.440]   If you're a person who's going on one to two trips a year,
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.520]   one or two credit cards just to optimize spending bonuses,
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.320]   it's gonna be more than enough.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.480]   What's your setup for travel hacking?
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.160]   Do you have a lot of cards, a couple cards?
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.800]   I mean, I have like 30 cards.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.520]   Okay, okay, so. Crazy.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.200]   But I also have this for work too,
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.160]   so it's like really different.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.520]   And I travel like constantly.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.760]   On my personal stuff, I use Built,
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   which is a card that lets you get points
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.920]   on your rent for free.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.240]   And they have some good category bonuses that I use.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.960]   And then I use the Chase Sapphire.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.760]   For work, I either use an Amex Gold or a Chase Ink.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.200]   Any favorite tactics for redeeming?
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.800]   There's a great new website out called Point.me,
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.560]   and you can just connect all your stuff through an API
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.760]   and just search like where you wanna go,
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.360]   and it'll tell you where to transfer your points
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.760]   to get the most value.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.360]   That's a really good news website.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.640]   They're still working on some of the kinks.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.320]   Like one of the things I don't like
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.560]   is you can't do a calendar view.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.640]   You have to search day by day by day.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.000]   Very frustrating.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.280]   But it's a new program, so they'll fix it eventually.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.680]   Yeah, when I talked to Tiffany, one of the founders,
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:12.080]   she basically said, "Don't expect that much.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.800]   "There might be a premium tier that you pay more for
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.280]   "if you wanna search more dates."
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.160]   So it's not clear that the full calendar view is coming,
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.320]   but I do like Seatspy for that feature.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.000]   They give you 365-day calendar view
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.120]   for a handful of airlines.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.640]   So before we wrap, I wanna go down one path,
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.760]   which is just inspiring people
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.240]   with some of the kind of off-the-beaten-path places
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.960]   you've enjoyed that people might not be considering.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.320]   I get lots of emails of people saying,
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.960]   "Oh, I have a trip coming up to Paris or London or Tokyo."
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.080]   But I think once you've kind of ticked off
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.400]   some of the most common places
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.760]   you're looking for inspiration,
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.360]   you've done more travel than probably anyone listening.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.200]   What are some places you think
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.600]   people need to put on their list to explore?
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:00.120]   - Taiwan, Romania, Bulgaria, Mexico.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.480]   I mean, like off-beat Mexico,
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:05.960]   like get out of like Tulum and Playa and all those places.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.800]   - I've been to Taiwan and it was fantastic,
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.160]   but a few of the others I haven't.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.160]   I'm dying to know what set them apart
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.440]   from the rest of the world.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.360]   - Taiwan is just like very under-visited, great food.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.960]   It's like clean China.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.320]   South Korea, just great nightlife and food.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   Bulgaria and Romania, incredible history,
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.560]   ruins, small little medieval towns,
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.120]   like national parks and mountains.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.640]   And you have the coast and it's just like phenomenal
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.080]   and cheap and not a lot of people go there.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.680]   Mexico was amazing.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.720]   Everyone's super nice.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.760]   There's just a vibrancy to life there,
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.680]   plus the food, so you can see there's a trend.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.880]   - Where in Mexico?
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.920]   I think Mexico might be really easy
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.280]   for a lot of people in the States
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:56.200]   to start exploring and flights can be pretty cheap.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.600]   What are the places that you think?
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.520]   - San Miguel de Allende, Oaxaca, Chiapas,
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.160]   Yucatan State, not the peninsula, Merida, Monterey,
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.720]   just got places that come to mind.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.560]   It's a huge country,
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.520]   but most travelers stick to a few places.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.840]   I mean, I love Mexico City too,
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.240]   so I mean, you can't go wrong there.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.280]   Other places that come to mind,
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.360]   Malaysia, I don't think gets enough attention.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:24.000]   Sri Lanka, Nepal, just great places,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.880]   but not a lot of tourists.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.920]   Basically getting a really unfiltered view of places.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.760]   - I think that's something I'm looking for now
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.880]   as we kind of evolve.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.280]   But one thing that's changed for me,
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.000]   and I'd love your perspective.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.280]   You know, we did a lot of travel solo,
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.760]   did a lot of travel with my wife,
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.960]   backpacking, and now we have kids
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.680]   for people who have a more demanding career,
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.200]   aren't able to work entirely on the road,
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.880]   have kids, have families.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.280]   How do you think that affects the style of travel
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.760]   you've spent years writing about and living?
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.840]   What do you think that looks like
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.080]   for the years ahead for you?
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.360]   - Well, I think budget travel is a state of mind
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.640]   more than a style.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:04.520]   Like, oh, we have to stay in hostels or whatever.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.560]   So for me, as long as I'm still doing the local thing,
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.040]   to me that's just budget travel.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.840]   I don't think I will change that.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.920]   I already like cruises.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.280]   And whenever I stay at resorts,
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.840]   I'm like, everything here is overpriced.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.240]   I just wanna go eat like whatever the locals are eating.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:25.240]   So I don't really see a lot of change happening in my life.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:30.000]   I think even as a family, things change, of course,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.040]   but as long as you're doing that local thing,
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.480]   it's really just more of a like your mindset
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.560]   than it is like, oh, anything else.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.120]   - I think one thing that I'm gonna change,
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.960]   and you already highlighted this,
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.940]   but just having less things to do.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.520]   It's easy to get three or four things done
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.920]   on your own in a day and still have lots of time
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.480]   for exploration.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.800]   With a family, it just feels like one.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.120]   The goal is one thing to accomplish today
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.880]   and let everything else come to chance.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.000]   Or maybe let your kids drive.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.260]   We just had a great conversation with Derek Sivers,
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.440]   who talked about how he traveled with his son.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:06.160]   And it was just let him lead and explore through their eyes,
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.020]   which can be very different from exploring through your own.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.320]   This is really reminiscent 'cause I did a eight month trip
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.680]   where it was just like this.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.760]   And my wife and I did a lot of this before kids
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.460]   is just recognizing that a lot of what you're going
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.480]   to experience, like your example in Italy,
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.120]   is being in another place, understanding another culture,
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.520]   food, language, and that doesn't require
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.600]   seeing every museum in the town.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.040]   It doesn't require ticking off every five-star restaurant.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.360]   It can be a lot different,
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.680]   and it can be a lot more rewarding to do that.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.000]   And even more so if you get outside of the cities.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.960]   Sometimes just where you stay.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.540]   Maybe don't stay in the most central part of town
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:50.760]   to force yourself to be around locals.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.800]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   I think as you age and you slow down,
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.520]   especially if you have kids, you slow down.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:01.520]   I don't have kids, but I've had a lot of other parents
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.320]   who travel with kids say the same thing.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.480]   They let their kids just go,
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.840]   and their kids will just discover things,
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.080]   and they then discover things.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.440]   One thing I'm gonna wrap with,
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.720]   is there a place in the world that if someone were going,
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.520]   you have a few recommendations?
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.480]   Maybe it's because you lived there for a while.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.000]   Maybe it's 'cause it's home.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.640]   If you go to Paris, go to Le Dix-Vins, Le Dix-Vins.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.720]   That's a great restaurant.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.200]   L-E-D-I-T-V-I-N.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.800]   How would you spend a day in Paris if you only had one?
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.360]   Wander and wander, get some wine, sit on the sand,
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.720]   sit in a park, go to a cafe, and just eat.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.760]   Paris is just great just to be there.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.840]   - I don't disagree.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.440]   If people wanna stay on top of everything you're writing,
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.520]   traveling, posting, where should they head?
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.960]   - You find me everywhere at nomadicrad.com
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.800]   and nomadicrad on social media.
