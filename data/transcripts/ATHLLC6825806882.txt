[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.280]   - Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.080]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.840]   If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.980]   and today I'm talking with Matt Kepnes,
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.840]   better known as Nomadic Matt.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.220]   In the early 2000s, he accidentally became
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.840]   one of the OG travel bloggers after saving money,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.440]   quitting his job and backpacking around the world.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.380]   For almost two decades, he's been traveling,
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.960]   writing about it and sharing how traveler is easier,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.600]   cheaper and more life enriching than more people realize.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.960]   He wrote the New York Times bestselling,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.120]   How to Travel the World on $50 a day.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.520]   And later, after more than a decade of travels,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.120]   he wrote a memoir called 10 Years a Nomad.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.240]   We're gonna talk about why travel doesn't have to cost
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.200]   as much as you think, how travel changes after doing it
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.640]   for as long as Matt has,
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.780]   what to do if you get burnt out on travel.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.080]   We'll get some of Matt's favorite tactics for travels
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.840]   and discuss whether $50 a day is really enough.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.700]   We'll also talk about why travel insurance
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.640]   is one of the most important elements of a good trip,
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.600]   which Matt knows firsthand from a crazy experience
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.560]   he'll share about getting stabbed abroad
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.880]   and a lot more than that.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.100]   So let's get started right after this.
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.120]   I used to say I didn't think buying a second home
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.720]   was a good financial decision,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.260]   but then I discovered fractional vacation home ownership
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.360]   and I actually bought one with Picasso
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.960]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380]   Don't worry, this is not a timeshare pitch.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.640]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.440]   then creates an LLC for each home.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.960]   So you can buy as little as one eighth of the property
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560]   and have real ownership, but it doesn't stop there.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.360]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.700]   handling design, cleaning, maintenance,
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.040]   bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.840]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.040]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560]   When we first heard about Picasso,
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.980]   it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.600]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.080]   toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.480]   Since then, it's truly become our second home
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.040]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.320]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.460]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.280]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.880]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.480]   And until the end of April, you can own now
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.880]   and pay later with Picasso Now,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.280]   which lets you put only 5% down
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.600]   and get the complete Picasso experience for 12 months.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.840]   After that, you can pay the rest of the down payment
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.640]   and move to long-term ownership,
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.920]   apply your 5% to another Picasso home, or just walk away.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.260]   So for a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.240]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.560]   where All The Hacks listeners
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.960]   will get a free Picasso Access account,
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.500]   which means you can see new listings
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.440]   before they go live on the website
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.640]   and up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.640]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso, P-A-C-A-S-O.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.760]   Matt, welcome to the show.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.600]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.480]   As always, it's fun to be here.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.960]   - Well, I have a lot of questions.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.920]   I'll special shout out All The Hacks member, Alyssa,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.840]   who sent in a ton of topics to discuss,
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.800]   but I wanna just start off asking
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.500]   what you think the biggest misconception
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.400]   people have about travel is.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.360]   - I mean, I think the obvious answer, at least to me,
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.720]   is that people think it's expensive.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.880]   I think less so now because so much is on social media
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.920]   and there's so many blogs and it's talked about.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.360]   The vast majority of people will say,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.160]   "Well, they don't really have time to travel."
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.320]   But if you dig, there's always time,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.120]   but then they're like, "Oh, I just can't afford it."
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.640]   Because people think,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.480]   "Oh, plane tickets are expensive, hotels, Airbnb."
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.720]   They see all these commercials
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.260]   and this glamorized version of travel on social media,
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.960]   and they just think, "Well, that's pricing.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.360]   "Travel's a luxury item, right?
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.860]   "It's not a must-have thing.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.800]   "It's something you do to relax, to take a break."
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.280]   And so there's this perception that this is expensive,
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.840]   when it doesn't have to be
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.920]   because you always can go over to wherever you're going
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.560]   and just do the local things,
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.680]   and the local things cost a non-touristy price.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.280]   If you ask people,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.320]   "Well, how much do you spend on your own life?"
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.560]   people have these very way off estimates.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.840]   They're on the lower end.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.800]   But if you get people to record all their expenses,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.860]   even like, "Oh, I bought a water bottle.
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.320]   "That's a couple bucks, right?"
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.760]   Yeah, but you don't think about it.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.520]   People actually spend a lot more than they think they do.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.680]   And then when you balance that
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.920]   versus the price of travel, it's oftentimes cheaper.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.880]   - I live in the Bay Area,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.980]   so anywhere in the world I would go
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.480]   has to be probably cheaper, except maybe Tokyo.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.880]   Life other places is cheaper.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.320]   I experienced this actually,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.920]   it was probably almost 15 years ago.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.360]   We traveled for eight months,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.600]   and we rented our place out at home,
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.580]   and we broke even or even came out slightly ahead
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.500]   because it turns out we were spending more
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.260]   to live in the Bay Area than we were spending to travel.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.760]   But I wanna get into some of those costs,
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.080]   some of the ways you save money,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.760]   some of the tactics you have,
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.360]   but I kinda wanna get started
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.360]   and just ask how travel has changed for you.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.840]   I know you have been in this industry for longer than many,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.600]   and by industry, I mean writing
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.960]   and sharing your travels online.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.040]   You wrote a memoir about what you've learned
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.560]   after being a nomad for a decade.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.320]   How have things evolved for you personally
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.680]   and in the industry?
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.040]   - I started this when I was 25.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.240]   I started traveling the world,
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.920]   and I'm 42 this year.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   And so obviously my days of cheap meals
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.360]   and 12-bed hostel dorms is long gone.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.400]   I like nice food.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.160]   Since I work when I travel,
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.360]   having a place to work is really important.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.240]   I have a, getting a lot of good sleep is important,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.400]   so I tend to get my own room, hotels.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.560]   I take a lot more paid walking tours or food tours.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.220]   And so for me, the biggest thing
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.200]   is that my accommodation is a lot nicer.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.160]   I take more paid activities,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.800]   whereas when I was 25,
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.160]   it was all about the free stuff,
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.520]   the hostel dorms, cooking your own meals.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.960]   I still consider myself a backpacker, budget traveler.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.880]   You know, I take public transportation
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.120]   and love street food.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.680]   I still do parks and local things
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.720]   and go to the markets and all that jazz.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.220]   I'm not a resort guy.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.440]   I don't really do luxury.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.360]   I mean, it's nice, but it feels very isolating to me.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.240]   So that's the biggest thing that's, for me, has changed
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.680]   is sort of probably the nicer digs.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.560]   And then how has travel changed?
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.800]   I think travel has become a lot more accessible
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.840]   than when I started traveling,
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.680]   both the ability to do it
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.140]   and the ability to find information.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.400]   When I started traveling,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.880]   the internet was just sort of taking off
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.200]   as a means of like finding information
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.480]   in the sense that you had like forums
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.800]   and like blogs and all these places
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.160]   you can go to ask questions about
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.520]   where do I find this hostel?
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.560]   How do I do this thing?
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.640]   And so I was still primarily using guidebooks
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.200]   as well as just asking around,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.880]   but between social media and the advent of so many blogs,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.060]   there's nothing you can't learn
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.280]   with a quick Google search.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.000]   There's no hidden restaurant, this hidden town.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.840]   Like, oh, have you been?
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.840]   Yeah, there are places that are more well-known
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.480]   than anywhere else,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.120]   but there's no place that's unknown
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.360]   in the age of the internet.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.480]   Somebody has been there
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.080]   and they posted an Instagram from there.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.440]   No matter like what little town it is,
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.840]   no matter where it is.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.840]   And so that is really great
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.120]   because it demystifies a lot of the travel experience.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.800]   It allows people to become more comfortable with going.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.600]   It's not so much of like you're going into the unknown.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.680]   It's like, oh, okay, I've heard of this place.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.840]   I've heard of this thing, so maybe I'll go there.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.720]   Even if you're like so scared
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.920]   'cause you're going to a place you've never been,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.760]   it's no longer like this fog out there.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.100]   And then the advent of all these budget airlines
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.960]   and everything has made it just a lot cheaper
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.760]   for people to travel.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.720]   - Sometimes one of the ways that I get inspiration
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.320]   is I'll just search on YouTube and it's like,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.160]   okay, well, what's this place like?
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160]   It's like, here's a video of a person
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.120]   walking down the street
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.000]   and you can get a really visceral feeling
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.120]   for what it's like to be there.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.520]   And I remember when we first went to South and East Africa,
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.280]   I had this one Brat travel guide that was from 1998
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.880]   because we were traveling for long enough
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.200]   that I couldn't bring a book for each country.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.840]   So I was like, this was the one.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.880]   You don't get a lot of feeling
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.500]   about what you're about to embark on there.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.420]   It was more of a directory and out of date,
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.260]   but significantly.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.160]   - Yeah, guidebooks, even in the best of times
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.200]   are usually a year and a half behind what's going on.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.440]   I never have used guidebooks as a price guide,
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.560]   just more of a rough guide.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.520]   - I think they're great about here's the part of town
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.680]   to look for, here's some ideas of how transportation works.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.600]   But I'm curious, you said now that you've gotten older,
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.680]   have done this a while, your digs have gone up.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.600]   You wrote the book, people have referenced it in many ways
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.320]   about being like the guide for backpacking
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.200]   about traveling the world on $50 a day.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.400]   Do you think that still holds
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.280]   both in today's world inflation pandemic
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.600]   and as people age and wanna experience travel
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.000]   not in a hostel with 12 beds?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.840]   - Yes and no.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.200]   That book was never about the number.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.360]   A lot of people would get caught up on that.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.800]   Like, oh, 50 bucks, good luck doing Norway at 50 bucks.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.520]   You're traveling the world at $50 a day.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.840]   So it's a daily average.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.840]   Some places, totally, especially post COVID, strong dollar.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.800]   India is still very cheap.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.440]   Parts of Central America, Southeast Asia,
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.040]   Eastern Europe, still very cheap.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.960]   But your average place for a hostel in Western Europe
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.520]   is probably 30 euros now a night.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.720]   So it's very rare to see dorm beds, 10 euros, 15 euros.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.080]   They're still out there, but they're harder to find
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.160]   and they're less common.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.360]   And the beds are probably gonna be like 20 beds.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   And I am going to redo this book
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.480]   probably for a post COVID, post inflation world.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.000]   I'd probably up it to like a 65, $70 a day average.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.480]   If you're doing the quintessential round the world trip,
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.120]   going to Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand,
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.920]   South and Central America.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.760]   And if you're coming from the US,
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.840]   that's going to be even better
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.640]   because the US dollar is so strong.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.400]   Will that stay? Who knows?
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.120]   When I planned my original trip around the world,
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.560]   I remember it was one US dollar
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.320]   got you a $1.30 Australian.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.480]   So that's what my budget was based off of.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.280]   And by the time I got there, it was one to one.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.280]   So I lost 30% of my budget because of that.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.240]   I had to readjust everything.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.040]   So it's less about the number and more about the style,
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.240]   like the tips and tricks.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.200]   If you're just looking for ways to travel cheap,
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.520]   forget about the number,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.480]   just use the strategies in the book.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.520]   - Okay. So let's talk about some of those strategies.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.720]   'Cause I liked how you actually broke it down.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.920]   It wasn't just, there are a bunch of strategies,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   go have a great trip.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.120]   It's here's what you specifically need to know.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.800]   So how would you walk someone through
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.960]   the high level of planning a trip like this
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.800]   with the goal to do it on a budget?
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.280]   What are the kind of key strategies
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.520]   you think people need to follow?
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.880]   - I think the biggest thing for people
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.920]   is one, travel slow.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.600]   The more you can sort of spread out your costs,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.640]   the better it will be.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.840]   If you're moving around a lot,
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.560]   you're gonna have high transportation costs.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.240]   And that really can eat into a lot of people's budgets.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.480]   But the big thing is just really being flexible.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.400]   Because if you can wait for that deal to come,
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.680]   then you're not tied into like,
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.360]   I have to get this flight on this day to this destination.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.720]   One of the benefits of long-term travel
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.800]   is that you're in no rush to do anything.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.760]   You can wait for that flight deal, that hotel deal,
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.040]   or you can find a flight deal or a hotel deal
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.520]   and be like, that's where we're going next
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.400]   because that's where it's cheapest.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.320]   And so big picture, always be flexible.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.660]   Second big picture thing is to travel like you live.
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.280]   You in your daily life cook food,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.600]   you don't eat expensive food all the time, restaurants.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.120]   You look for free activities,
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.520]   you take public transportation, you go for walks.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.660]   Do the same when you travel.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.320]   If you really wanna get a taste of local life,
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.120]   go to the local farmer's market,
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.680]   go take the train or the bus,
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.760]   go for a walk, sit in a park.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.520]   Travel doesn't always have to be about doing things.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.480]   It can be more about just existing in a place
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.440]   and soaking up the vibe.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.960]   And so if you travel like you live,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.680]   you're gonna end up doing all the things that locals do.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.160]   Because what people do in Berlin
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.480]   isn't different than what people do in the Bay Area or Austin.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.740]   Everyone gets up and goes to work and takes a train
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.200]   and goes grocery shopping and lives their day-to-day life
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.800]   and then walks and maybe sits by the river.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   They do something, sit in the park, do those things.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.760]   - Let's pause for a second
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.280]   and go back to a kind of more macro question.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.880]   When it comes to travel, why do you love travel?
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.520]   What is it about travel that makes it something
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.520]   that you've now, I guess,
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.800]   dedicated your entire professional career to
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.040]   and something you've spent decades of your life doing?
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.200]   - I don't like to be bored.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.320]   I guess that's one reason.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.660]   When you're traveling, you're always doing something.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.220]   I like mastering my own time.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.700]   I mean, this is an accidental career.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.860]   The goal was never to start a company.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.860]   It was just to keep traveling for as long as possible
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.500]   so that I could have my own time, have my own schedule,
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.020]   do everything I wanted to do,
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.300]   just get out there and go explore and see the world.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.300]   The world is a book, right?
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.700]   But the world is also a puzzle.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.760]   And every place you go to adds one more piece.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.920]   It's an unsolvable puzzle.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.760]   You'll never finish it in your lifetime,
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.640]   but you just keep adding more to it.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.800]   I just find people interesting.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.400]   I'm also deeply interested in history and politics.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.840]   And so going over to places
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.760]   and learning about why they do things
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.520]   is just fascinating to me.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.640]   - It sounds like a lot of those things
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.080]   aren't always the paid tour, the Michelin star meals.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.360]   Finding the joy of travel
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.800]   that isn't what you saw on Instagram,
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.980]   I think can often make for the experience.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.500]   So I'm curious, when you're trying to find those experiences,
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.460]   when you're trying to meet people,
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.500]   what do you do to connect with people?
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.780]   I think in today's world,
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.820]   people are maybe a little more closed off
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.060]   than they were 20 years ago
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.460]   because they have their phone to distract them at a bar.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.300]   It seems harder to meet people.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.140]   Have you found ways to keep that kind of vibe going,
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.820]   especially now that you're not in the hostel,
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.500]   you might be in your own private room?
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.500]   - Well, one of the reasons I still love hostels
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.540]   is even though I'm in my own private room, I'm a hostel.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.800]   You still get the vibe, right?
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.600]   So you can still go to the common area.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.880]   I think the opposite is actually true.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.000]   I think the internet has made it easier to meet people.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.020]   True, people are glued to their phone,
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.920]   especially in the hostel,
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   in a way that wasn't true in 2006 when I started traveling.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.400]   But there's so many apps and ways to meet people
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.840]   through couch surfing, social media,
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.920]   Instagram, Facebook groups, Bumble BFF,
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.160]   meetup.com, walking tours, bar crawls.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.040]   Like there's lots of ways to meet people
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.020]   and the internet has actually made it easier to meet people
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.760]   if you're open to it.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.080]   And I think people are a lot more open
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.600]   to just meeting a stranger online.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.840]   It's not weird to like,
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.200]   oh, there's a cool meetup happening.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.400]   I'm just gonna walk over to it 'cause I'm new here.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.500]   - Is there any kind of mental checklist
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.120]   or things you do before you're going to a new place
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.280]   to try to connect with people, figure out what to do?
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.880]   What resources do you use to kind of crowdsource ideas
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.480]   of things that you might spend your time on?
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.240]   I know you do say leave a lot of your time open
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.760]   for serendipity, so maybe the answer is none,
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.040]   but I'm curious what kind of research you do in advance.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.440]   - Very little, maybe read a couple of blog posts,
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.400]   bookmark a few restaurants.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.960]   I try to just go there and see where the day takes me.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.720]   Instagram, my Twitter feed.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.800]   If I'm in the mood to meet people,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.160]   like in the sense that I want to actively make sure
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.840]   there's people around me, I'll either stay at a hostel
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.080]   or I'll look at like a expat Facebook group
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.880]   or meetup.com or something
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.760]   and see what's going on while I'm there.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.960]   Since I travel a lot for work,
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.720]   and so my travels are about getting the price of food
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.480]   because we have to write a guide to it.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.480]   It really depends on am I there for research purposes
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.880]   or am I there for fun?
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.320]   So if I'm there at a destination
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.000]   'cause we're gonna write about it,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.400]   I have a mission, I stick to it.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.880]   Yeah, if I chat up locals and they're like,
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.840]   "Come to this thing," I'm like, "Okay, sure."
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.880]   But my mind isn't like, "I'm gonna go join this group
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.920]   "to see if there's a cool event going on."
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.640]   If I'm there for fun, I most likely will do that.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.560]   - Do you all remember episode 122
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.880]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.040]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.080]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen,
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.000]   but one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.440]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.280]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.920]   from Anyday, I am a total convert
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.040]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.320]   for this episode.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.360]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.640]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.960]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.000]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.640]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.560]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.720]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.960]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.560]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.740]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.040]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.360]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.440]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.560]   or use the code HACKS15 at checkout.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.560]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.520]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.120]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.800]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.160]   as you build your wealth.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.440]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.280]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.440]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.960]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.960]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.360]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.640]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.800]   join me on All the Hacks in episode 87
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.140]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.860]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.660]   are first generation wealth,
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.760]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.880]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.220]   and learn from each other
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.820]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.100]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.440]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.860]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.000]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.480]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.920]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.560]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.020]   So many of these conversations
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.240]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.920]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.760]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.840]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.980]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.220]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.620]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.580]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.660]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.040]   Any memorable experiences that have come
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.600]   from random joining things
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.560]   that you just found on the internet?
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.400]   - I joined a couple of couch surfing groups
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.520]   when I lived in Paris a few years back,
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.560]   and those people became my friends
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.920]   for the entire time I lived there.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.260]   Back in the day, during the MySpace era,
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.160]   I met a bunch of people in a Thailand travel group,
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.120]   and we ended up traveling around Southeast Asia
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.560]   for like three months together.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.420]   So that was fun.
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.920]   - Our travels were at a similar time in life,
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.040]   and it was the Lonely Planet forums.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.120]   - Yes, yeah. - Where we would just post,
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.320]   "Hey, we're in South Africa.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.080]   "We ended up meeting these two guys from Sweden,
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.040]   "and we ended up renting a car, buying a tent,
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.080]   "and all this stuff together,
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.520]   "and we basically camped in a tent with them
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.660]   "driving around Namibia, Botswana,
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.240]   "and South Africa for three weeks."
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.480]   So I think that's still possible.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.960]   It just sounds like you gotta find
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.680]   a few different places to find people.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.480]   - Yeah, we do events here in Austin,
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.160]   and somebody came to one.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.280]   I was like, "Oh, how long have you been reading the blog?"
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.440]   'Cause I just assumed they had come,
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.040]   'cause I was there, and it's part of our blog thing.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.280]   And she was like, "I just found this event on Eventbrite.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.720]   "I don't know what this is."
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.400]   And I was like, "Oh, that's really cool."
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.520]   She's like, "I'm just passing through."
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.880]   I was like, "Super, well, welcome."
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.720]   - I remember after six or so months,
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.000]   I kind of was ready for something different,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.380]   and we were doing some slow travel.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.920]   I'm curious, you did it for a decade.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.040]   What did you do to avoid getting burnt out about travel?
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   - It's impossible not to get burnt out.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.600]   You will get bored at some point.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.480]   You will get tired.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.960]   You will get burnt out.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.680]   If you're just doing long-term travel,
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.280]   it becomes your day-to-day life, right?
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.240]   And eventually, you need a break from that.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.020]   In your day-to-day life, you take a break.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.920]   You go on vacation.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.160]   If travel life, you kind of just sit in one place
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.520]   and recharge your battery.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.520]   Travel is a battery.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.640]   It's not some unlimited wellspring of energy.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.420]   You need to rest at some point,
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.280]   because everywhere you go,
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.720]   you have to relearn how to live, the language,
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.280]   how to get around, where to eat, where to stay,
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.720]   local customs, the streets.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.040]   You're relearning life every day,
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.920]   and it's mentally very taxing.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.240]   There's a reason why, like,
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.620]   when you drive to work all the time,
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.660]   you can tune out, because it becomes like a routine.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.520]   Your mind just goes on autopilot.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.360]   When you're traveling, there is no autopilot,
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.640]   because you're relearning everything.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.520]   And so eventually, you're just burnt out.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.720]   You need a break.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.520]   Slow travel can really help that,
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.000]   because you're not really rushing yourself a lot.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.280]   You're adjusting to new places at a slower pace,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.960]   but even the slowest of travelers, eventually,
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   you're just like, "I just wanna sit."
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.800]   - Even short trips, I've found, can be a lot,
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.680]   and so sometimes it feels so counterintuitive
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.280]   to spend an afternoon on a one-week trip,
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.360]   like watching a movie in your hotel room,
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.120]   but the amount of energy you can recharge
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.600]   by just hanging out and relaxing,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.040]   I think, is really valuable,
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.220]   and so I think people very often think,
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.140]   "Oh, I'm in this country.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.940]   "I can't afford to not be doing something
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.360]   "every second of every day,"
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.640]   but sometimes you start to lose the appreciation for it
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.960]   if it feels like it's painful and it's work,
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.820]   so don't be afraid to take a break,
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.800]   even on a week-long trip, for an afternoon.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.600]   - Yeah, and if your goal is to go to Italy for a week
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.280]   and soak in Italian culture,
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.200]   spending an afternoon doing nothing
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.660]   is very much a part of Italian culture.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.600]   Go sit at the piazza and just enjoy a cafe
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.840]   and just sit around and chat and people-watch.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.000]   They get a real sense of Italy that way.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.540]   - You mentioned customs
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.800]   and all the learning of a new place.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.520]   I've had a few questions from listeners
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.400]   that ask about going to places that are very unfamiliar,
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.240]   whether it's the customs or the language.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.060]   I'm curious what advice you have to someone.
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.800]   Maybe they're going somewhere in the Middle East
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.380]   or in Asia where the customs and the language
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.340]   are all totally foreign to them.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.680]   What would you tell them to do, either in advance
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.240]   or just to help them understand
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.120]   how it might not be as difficult as they might think?
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.380]   - Read a book.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.880]   You can't really know a place
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.340]   until you've read something about it.
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.400]   So I always find reading up about where you're visiting,
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.360]   a history book if you can,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.480]   or even just like a current events book,
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.160]   something that just sort of gives you insight
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.760]   into the local culture can be super helpful.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.880]   Additionally, there's so many blogs out there
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.200]   in the world these days
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.680]   that you can read on any subject you want.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.320]   And from local writers too.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.040]   So like people that live in destination
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.600]   are now local bloggers.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.040]   That can really help you get a sense of place
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.880]   and understanding.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.080]   Also a great way to get food recommendations too.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.920]   If you find a local food blogger on Instagram,
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.160]   their audience is other locals, not tourists.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.360]   So you're gonna get all of like the inside info.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.840]   - If you have a VPN and you can connect to an IP
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.280]   in the country, or maybe you can change your Google search
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.500]   to that country, you might get a different set of results
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.800]   than if you're searching for a US IP
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.520]   or on like Google US search.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.400]   So I've sometimes found a better set of results
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.960]   when I'm searching for stuff online.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.440]   Maybe there's a local search engine even,
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.760]   but if you could try to anchor yourself
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.800]   to searching within the country,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.040]   you get maybe more relevant topics
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.720]   than the kind of travel guide from the foreigners overseas.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.400]   I know one thing that I've heard you talk about
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.600]   maybe more articulately than I can is about communication.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.480]   And I think so many people might assume
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.680]   that you need to speak a language to go lots of places,
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.240]   especially if you wanna go off the beaten path.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.280]   And so first I'm gonna ask,
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.120]   how many languages do you actually speak
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.240]   given that I think you've probably been to,
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.640]   if not a hundred, close to a hundred countries, I'm guessing.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.140]   - I speak pretty good Spanish, decent Thai,
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.200]   and I can understand and read French,
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.000]   though my ability to give a reply was very slow.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.120]   - But that hasn't held you back from going to
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.200]   plenty of countries that don't speak those languages.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.400]   - Oh yeah, English is pretty widely spoken,
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.880]   at least basic English.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.080]   Even if you're going off the beaten path, sign language.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.760]   Everyone kind of knows the universal
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.080]   like cluck cluck for chicken, choo choo for train.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.760]   People want to help you,
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.320]   and so you just gotta give them that opportunity
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.340]   to just be like, this is what I need.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.560]   Most communication is non-verbal anyway,
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.680]   based on like your facial expression
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.760]   or like how you're miming things or body language.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.120]   That can really help people figure out what you need.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.960]   So never be afraid, and there's always Google Translate now.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.880]   So like worst case scenario,
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.600]   you open your phone and you type in
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.600]   and it kind of gives like a okay translation,
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.800]   but probably enough to get your point across to people.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.860]   - Does it ever feel like cheating to you a little bit,
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.600]   having been to the type of travel
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.040]   where you had to rely on so much intuition
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.480]   or kind of hard work to communicate with people
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.480]   that didn't speak the language that now it's like,
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.920]   well, I guess I could just pull out my phone
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.560]   and type something and it'll be understood by someone
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.200]   that has no common language threads.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.280]   How do you feel about this?
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.280]   - I don't like it,
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.080]   simply because I don't like pulling out my phone.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.080]   In some parts of the world,
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   that's not always the wisest thing to do.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.960]   So I'd rather just do it the old fashioned way,
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.240]   but I'm an old funny daddy, so.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.320]   I mean, if there was like an earpiece that did it,
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.800]   I would probably get that earpiece.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.020]   Like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.800]   where they put that slug in his ear
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.600]   and he can understand everything,
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.480]   that's what I would probably do.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.080]   But I don't like pulling out my phone a lot,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.760]   'cause then you're always on your phone
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.920]   and it's like back and forth.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.400]   You know, it slows down conversation.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.560]   - You mentioned earlier that now you like to stay in places
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.600]   by yourself, but you also like to go on a lot more tours
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.440]   that cost money.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.320]   How do you find them?
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.880]   How do you make sure you don't get caught up
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.440]   in terrible tours designed for tourists?
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.340]   Are there review sites?
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.840]   How do you think about that?
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.320]   - I do mostly like day walking tours
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.240]   or a free tour or something like that.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.440]   Very rarely do multi-day trips,
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.360]   but Best Walking Tour in X
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.840]   is really a pretty good search term.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.800]   I'll read a couple of blog posts
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.280]   and if the same company appears in a couple
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.120]   and their tours look good and reasonably priced,
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.080]   I'll probably pick them.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.540]   You know, you can see star rating.
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.600]   So like 17,000 people on TripAdvisor are like,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.040]   this is four stars.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.700]   And then like three writers on blogs are like,
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.180]   I took this tour and it was really good
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.900]   and I wasn't paid to say that.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.820]   And you're like, okay, maybe it's pretty good.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.140]   - It's always good to look for the,
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.100]   my unbiased opinion of,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.500]   I find that to be a helpful search term
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.580]   for almost any product.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.580]   You're like unbiased opinion, XYZ mattress.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.740]   Is there any place you've been where you've actually found
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.100]   that just sign language and English weren't enough?
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.780]   And to be clear, when we say sign language,
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.320]   we're not talking, you know, ASL,
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.820]   professional sign communication.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.360]   We're talking to more hand miming and gestures,
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.840]   but are there places you've found
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.000]   that it's actually been very difficult
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.880]   to get around and communicate?
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.160]   - No, not really.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.480]   Maybe I haven't been to enough places
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.180]   that are like so off the beaten path,
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.080]   but I've always found that miming
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.720]   and like sign language gets you far enough.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.400]   - I wanna go back to some of the tactics,
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.420]   especially around what you travel with.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.660]   I know you're a fan of a backpack,
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.640]   but nowadays what are the things that you take on every trip?
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.640]   Not the obvious things.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.640]   I'm sure you bring a toothbrush,
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.280]   but what are the things that people might be packing
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.040]   that are different from how you pack?
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.320]   - I honestly don't take much stuff with me
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.860]   because I started at a time where you didn't need a lot.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:25.440]   And so if I ever need something like an umbrella,
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.440]   I'll buy it.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.760]   Or if I need medicine, I'll pick it up on the way.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.120]   I definitely take a towel.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.600]   Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 101.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   I always have a towel.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.280]   But honestly, don't take much stuff.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.240]   I mean, I'm not a photographer, so I just use my phone,
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.120]   but to me, less is more.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.880]   Like what do you need to take?
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.560]   Couple of clothes, a couple of books,
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.200]   phone charger, and your phone.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   And I take my computer.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.600]   I take a notebook to journal, backup credit cards.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.580]   And that's really it.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.560]   I take a flashlight.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.160]   I think a lot of people underestimate the power
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   of having a flashlight,
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.980]   especially if you're camping a lot
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.560]   or just out in rural areas often.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.200]   Just having that with you is really good.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.320]   But other than that, I don't take a lot of gear.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.640]   I'm like anti-gear.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.280]   I'm also anti-app.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.480]   If you're always like, "What apps do you use?"
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.880]   I'm like, "Google Maps."
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.340]   That's it.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.440]   Like, you don't need anything else.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.600]   Get off your phone.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.680]   Like, put down your phone.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.520]   Use it less.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.560]   You don't need it.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.920]   - You mentioned backup credit cards.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.580]   We could go probably for a while about travel hacking,
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.380]   but one area I haven't really talked about
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.480]   is how much do you think about banking and budgeting
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.000]   and that aspect of it for a long-term trip
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.400]   where you're gonna need to access money
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.960]   and you need to pay bills?
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.720]   Do you do anything differently than you would
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.800]   if you were living stateside?
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.200]   - So, like, I'm in this unique position
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.400]   where I work and travel, so money comes in
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.480]   and it's all taxed right off for me.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.760]   So I would say that my recommendation for people
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.680]   is always to have two bank accounts.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.200]   Like, if you're an American,
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.440]   you should definitely have the Charles Schwab ATM card.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.440]   There are no bank fees, no ATM fees,
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.120]   and if you get charged an ATM fee,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.400]   they will reimburse your ATM fee.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.120]   So I always have money there.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.800]   That's my primary card when I travel.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.960]   And if you lose it, they'll basically FedEx it to you
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.160]   anywhere in the world within 48 hours.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.880]   But it's always good to have a backup
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.360]   just in case that gets hacked or something happens
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.800]   where you can't get in your 48 hours.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.640]   So I always carry two, two ATM cards
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.400]   and at least two credit cards.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.320]   Like, I'll carry more than two credit cards
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.640]   just 'cause I'm a travel hacker.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.680]   I only ever go out with one.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.320]   I only take my ATM card out very rarely.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.160]   It's always home.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.000]   I'm just the cash out that you need.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.480]   But that varies by destination.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.120]   You know, like, I mean, in Japan,
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.600]   you can walk around with $10 million in your pocket
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.800]   and no one's gonna do anything.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.160]   Versus like, I wouldn't walk around Columbia
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.080]   with like a bunch of money or plastic in my pants.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.720]   But at least definitely those two.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.840]   And for the primary account that I have
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.640]   in terms of the Charles Schwab card,
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.600]   I only keep a few thousand dollars in there.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.920]   So if somebody were to kidnap me
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.840]   and say, "Take all the money out,"
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.400]   it's not gonna drain everything.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.880]   There's only a maximum amount they can take.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.720]   - What about passport?
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.640]   Are you bring the passport with you
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.560]   when you're out and about
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.640]   or leave it back in the hotel or hostel?
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.520]   - I always leave it in the hotel or hostel.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.560]   - I know I've heard varying opinions here,
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.720]   which is like, you always wanna have some form of ID
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.760]   if something happens, if you get in trouble.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.920]   And then the other is like,
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.560]   you definitely don't wanna have your passport
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.480]   lost, dropped, stolen while you're out.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.200]   - I bring my driver's license with me everywhere I go
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.360]   as a form of ID.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.800]   Passport stays inside.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.320]   The only time I will break that rule
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.960]   is if it's required for like a spot check on the train.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.160]   Sometimes in Europe, if you're on a train,
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.600]   even if you're just like going between cities,
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.880]   it'll be like a spot check.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.280]   But like just going out to like the bar
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.600]   or a restaurant or walking around, no.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.640]   And if I were to ever get stopped by the police
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.400]   and they're like, where's your passport?
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.520]   And I'd be like, don't let him tell, let's go get it.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.920]   I guess like if you were in a country that required it
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.880]   and like you got stopped and there was a lot of corruption,
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.720]   you may have to pay a bribe,
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.920]   but nobody wants that paperwork.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.280]   Like, oh, why'd you arrest this guy
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.480]   who didn't have his passport on him?
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.840]   It's a lot of paperwork for nothing.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.320]   Universal rule is cops never wanna do paperwork.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.160]   And every country has paperwork.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.080]   The best will get a warning,
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.160]   at the worst, you'll pay a fine, like a bribe.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.480]   - A fine.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.320]   - With AirQuest.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.760]   - Whatever you wanna call it.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.720]   - Been in any of those situations?
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.560]   - No.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.880]   - Where you've had to pay a fine slash bribe?
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.320]   - Nope, never.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.720]   - Our only one was border crossing from Syria into Lebanon.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.640]   And the taxi driver, funny enough,
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.360]   he was so embarrassed that his country
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.320]   would be the kind of place where you had to pay a fine,
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.600]   that he paid the fine out of his own fare
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.180]   because he didn't want us to know about it.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.200]   But we were in the car for a few hours, we asked about it.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.000]   And he was like, "Yeah, the way this works is,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.600]   "if you get to the border and you have foreigners
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.080]   "and you don't pay a tip,
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.580]   "then they just hold you here for hours.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.420]   "And that causes delays for me and you,
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.920]   "and our country's terrible at doing this stuff,
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.760]   "but I'll do it."
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.280]   So I've never had to do it myself,
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.900]   but I know the paperwork issue deeply
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:18.020]   because my wife was pulled over speeding in Bosnia.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:22.000]   And they were sitting here like, "Oh, this is the fine."
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.560]   And she was like, "Oh, I don't know."
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.660]   We just waited it out.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:25.900]   And eventually they were like, "Yeah, you can go
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.180]   "because we're not gonna try to fill out this paperwork
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.620]   "for your international driver's license and everything."
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.300]   I wish I could say I'm eating a fully balanced diet
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.920]   every day, but the reality is that I'm not.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.780]   So I love having an easy way
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.920]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.620]   which is why I kickstart every day
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.520]   with AG1 from Athletic Greens,
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.080]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.600]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.360]   because I think it's the best option
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.220]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.960]   You take one scoop of AG1,
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.680]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.960]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.940]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.400]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.560]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.620]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.140]   and energized for the day,
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.660]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.420]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.420]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.180]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.260]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.140]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.620]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.980]   All you have to do is visit

[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.140]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens

[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.020]   This year, I'm excited to learn as much as I can
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.540]   from the world's best minds,
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.580]   and an amazing way I do that is with Masterclass,
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.560]   where you can learn anytime, anywhere,
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.020]   and at your own pace,
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.620]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.100]   With over 180 classes from a range
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.860]   of world-class instructors,
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.540]   that thing you've always wanted to do
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.180]   is closer than you think.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.120]   Seriously, I feel like every time
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.260]   I wanna learn something new,
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.680]   I can find a class on that topic
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.580]   from one of the best in the world.
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.900]   Wanna negotiate better?
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.760]   FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss's class is amazing.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.860]   Wanna be funnier?
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.620]   Steve Martin and Judd Apatow
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.260]   both have great classes teaching comedy.
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.460]   Or maybe you just wanna dive
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.440]   into the science of better sleep?
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.600]   Well, Matt Walker is the best in the world,
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.360]   and he has a class as well.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.340]   I could go on and on,
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.640]   so you'll just have to take a look yourself,
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.080]   because the depth of knowledge the instructors have
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.660]   and the quality of the experience is so good.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.500]   I highly recommend you check it out.

[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.740]   One thing we haven't talked about
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.060]   that I know you have a pretty strong opinion on
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.360]   is travel insurance.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.500]   What perspective do you have on travel insurance
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.480]   and its necessity in a day where so many credit cards
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.180]   have lots of forms of insurance baked into them?
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.620]   I still think it's very important
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.980]   just 'cause you get better medical care,
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.800]   like emergency care.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.580]   It's really the only higher-end premium credit cards
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.400]   with $600 a year, kind of the top-end ones,
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.840]   but you get really robust travel insurance.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.080]   But even then, these aren't travel insurance companies.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.640]   The credit cards tacking this on,
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.040]   they're not really streamlined to process claims
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.280]   in a way that a company whose only purpose
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.640]   is travel insurance.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.480]   A lot of these credit cards
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.320]   don't really cover good medical evacuation.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.840]   And so if you just want protection on trip interruption
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.440]   or cancellation or something gets stolen,
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.040]   the credit card you paid that trip on
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.680]   is probably good enough.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.280]   But if you want actual medical insurance
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.960]   in case something goes wrong,
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.080]   you're gonna want something to pay extra for.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.280]   And travel insurance isn't that expensive.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.040]   So it's like, you're not paying hundreds of bucks a month.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.840]   You get plans for 50 bucks.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.520]   Are there any providers you've used,
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.440]   or what do you use when you travel?
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.320]   I use a company called Safety Wing.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.320]   They're really good.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.240]   World Nomads is also really good.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.680]   For people having more gear,
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.840]   Insure Nomads is really good, but pretty expensive.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.440]   And then for seniors,
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.400]   I would definitely recommend Insure My Trip,
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.840]   because not a lot of plans cover people over 70.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.520]   Okay.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.320]   Have you ever had to use travel insurance?
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.200]   I used it in Columbia.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.800]   I've used it in South Africa when my bag got stolen.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.240]   I've used it in Thailand.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.360]   So yeah, I've used it quite a number of times.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.440]   It's coming very handy.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.520]   It's coming handy for friends.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.480]   I had a friend break their back in the Amazon.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.880]   And they had to get airlifted out,
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.960]   and then sent back to Canada.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.160]   And travel insurance covered the whole thing.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.000]   Wow.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.920]   I think it's so funny we get caught up
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.520]   in thinking travel insurance is about,
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.720]   my flight got canceled.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.880]   But it can be about a lot of other things.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.120]   I don't know what kind of medical situations
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.600]   you've ever been in overseas.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.160]   They don't end up being that expensive,
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.480]   unless they're very extreme.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.920]   And I can assure you that an airlift
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   from South America to Canada
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.160]   is not something you want to have to cover on your own.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.280]   No, no.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.840]   That you do not.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.240]   That you do not.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.000]   Any situations you've ever been in,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.080]   I think sometimes people think,
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.280]   oh, if I have a bad situation,
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.040]   I'll never want to travel again.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.080]   I assume you've been in a situation
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.040]   that might scare other people away.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.400]   And I'm curious how it affected how you travel,
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.840]   and how or why it didn't stop you from keeping going.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.760]   Yeah, I got stabbed in Columbia.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.080]   And my mother always sends me
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.800]   every State Department warning about Mexico.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.760]   But it's like, hey, we live in the States.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.360]   People get gunned down going to Walmart.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.480]   There are mass shootings all the time in this country.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.640]   Bad things happen.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.640]   It's just part of life.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.280]   It doesn't matter if you're home,
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.000]   or in Mexico, or in Thailand,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.160]   or in Paris, or in Japan.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.120]   Shit happens.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.520]   You can live in fear and say,
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.160]   oh, I'm just gonna never go anywhere.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.360]   But then you walk across the street to a movie theater,
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.520]   and then you don't make it out because some psychopath.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.560]   Or you get hit by a car on your way to work.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.080]   Are you really gonna live in fear about every what if?
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.160]   If so, then never leave your house.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.000]   If you're up for it,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.160]   I'd love to hear the story in Columbia.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.240]   And maybe from the perspective of,
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.160]   I think a lot of people don't really plan for that.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.120]   And so they don't know what they would do
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.120]   in that circumstance.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.880]   And I imagine you're here now, so it all went well.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.920]   How did you know what to do?
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.320]   And where did you end up going?
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.200]   And how did the trip unfold after that?
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.720]   Yeah, I was in Bogota.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.680]   I had my phone out.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   And long story short,
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.360]   you shouldn't have fancy electronics out.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.040]   I just forgot to put it back in before I left this cafe.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.200]   And someone tried to take it,
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.160]   and he jerked backwards instead of just going forward.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.640]   So we started tussling.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.840]   And then, yeah, he had a small little knife.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.160]   I thought it was just punching me.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.560]   I mean, if he had shown the knife,
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.640]   I would have been like, "Yo, take the phone."
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.640]   But afterwards, I was like, "Oh, so sore."
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.240]   And I was just covered in blood.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.120]   That's 'cause he was stabbing me.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.560]   Luckily, it was a small box cutter,
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.040]   so it wasn't very big.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.480]   I assume you went to the hospital and everything was fine.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.680]   Yeah, the whole thing cost me like 50 bucks.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   The flight home was like 1,000 bucks,
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.400]   and I asked for reimbursement for that.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.360]   But the 50 bucks, I was like,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.000]   "Yeah, it's not worth the paperwork."
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.120]   And they could have done it for 50 bucks,
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.080]   but I did it for the flight.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.640]   Would you go back to Bogota after that?
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.560]   Oh, yeah, 100%.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.880]   I love Bogota.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.240]   I was really sad to have to go home.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.440]   I've also been to Bogota.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.360]   It's just a great place.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.960]   I love the country of Colombia.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.120]   I've been there a few times.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.160]   Bogota is close enough and time zone good enough
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.000]   that I think you could even do it in a long weekend
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:15.960]   and have a great trip.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.120]   I don't wanna not do slow travel,
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.640]   but I think for those who don't have the time to do it,
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.440]   it's still a place that you can go
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.040]   in a short period of time because of the proximity.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.280]   It's such a phenomenal place.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.520]   I was there for six weeks,
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.840]   and I'm gonna stay there another six weeks.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.760]   I wanna just get some quick thoughts on travel hacking.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.840]   I've obviously covered this topic a ton.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.560]   You've thought about it a lot.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.440]   Are there perspectives you have on it
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.880]   that you think are maybe a little bit contrarian
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.320]   to the average person who plays the points and miles game
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.760]   that would be helpful to hear?
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.320]   I think that people get too caught up in point value.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.000]   Just for most people, just get a card,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.200]   book your flight, that works,
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.480]   and don't spend time doing it.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.000]   People overcomplicate the simple.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.360]   If you're a person who's going on one to two trips a year,
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.480]   one or two credit cards just to optimize spending bonuses,
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.240]   it's gonna be more than enough.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.400]   To your setup for travel hacking,
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.080]   do you have a lot of cards, a couple cards?
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.720]   I mean, I have like 30 cards.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.560]   Okay, okay.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.440]   Crazy.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.120]   But I also have this for work too,
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.200]   so it's like really different.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.440]   And I travel like constantly.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.680]   On my personal stuff, I use Built,
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.680]   which is a card that lets you get points
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.840]   on your rent for free,
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.160]   and they have some good category bonuses that I use.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.880]   And then I use the Chase Sapphire.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.680]   For work, I either use an MX Gold or a Chase Ink.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.120]   Any favorite tactics for redeeming?
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.760]   There's a great new website out called Point.me,
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.480]   and you can just connect all your stuff through an API
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.680]   and just search where you wanna go,
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.280]   and it'll tell you where to transfer your points
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.680]   to get the most value.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.280]   That's a really good news website.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.560]   They're still working on some of the kinks.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.240]   Like one of the things I don't like
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.480]   is you can't do a calendar view.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.560]   You have to search day by day by day.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.920]   Very frustrating.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:05.200]   But it's a new program, so they'll fix it eventually.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.600]   Yeah, when I talked to Tiffany, one of the founders,
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.000]   she basically said, "Don't expect that much.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.720]   "There might be a premium tier that you pay more for
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.200]   "if you wanna search more dates."
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.080]   So it's not clear that the full calendar view is coming,
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.240]   but I do like Seatspy for that feature.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.920]   They give you 365-day calendar view
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.040]   for a handful of airlines.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:30.560]   So before we wrap, I wanna go down one path,
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.680]   which is just inspiring people
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.160]   with some of the kind of off-the-beaten-path places
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.880]   you've enjoyed that people might not be considering.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.240]   I get lots of emails of people saying,
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.880]   "Oh, I have a trip coming up to Paris or London or Tokyo."
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.000]   But I think once you've kind of ticked off
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.320]   some of the most common places
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.680]   you're looking for inspiration,
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.280]   you've done more travel than probably anyone listening.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.520]   What are some places you think people need
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.520]   to put on their list to explore?
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.040]   - Taiwan, Romania, Bulgaria, Mexico.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.400]   I mean, like off-beat Mexico.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.840]   Like get out of like Tulum and Playa and all those places.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.720]   - I've been to Taiwan and it was fantastic,
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.080]   but a few of the others I haven't.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.080]   I'm dying to know what set them apart
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.360]   from the rest of the world.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.280]   - Taiwan is just like very under-visited, great food.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.880]   It's like clean China.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.240]   South Korea, just great nightlife and food.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.240]   Bulgaria and Romania, incredible history,
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.480]   ruins, small little medieval towns,
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.040]   like national parks and mountains.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.560]   And you have the coast and it's just like phenomenal
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.000]   and cheap and not a lot of people go there.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.600]   Mexico was amazing.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.640]   Everyone's super nice.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.680]   There's just a vibrancy to life there,
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.880]   plus the food.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.600]   So you can see there's a trend.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.800]   - Where in Mexico?
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.840]   I think Mexico might be really easy
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:54.320]   for a lot of people in the States to start exploring
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.160]   and flights can be pretty cheap.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.520]   What are the places that you think?
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:01.440]   - San Miguel de Allende, Oaxaca, Chiapas,
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.720]   Yucatan State, not the peninsula,
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.800]   Merida, Monterrey, just a couple of places
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.640]   that come to mind.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.480]   It's a huge country,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.480]   but most travelers stick to a few places.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.760]   I mean, I love Mexico City too,
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.200]   so I mean, you can't go wrong there.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.200]   Other places that come to mind,
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.320]   Malaysia, I don't think gets enough attention.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.920]   Sri Lanka, Nepal, just great places,
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.840]   but not a lot of tourists.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.880]   Basically getting a really unfiltered view of places.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.720]   - I think that's something I'm looking for now
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.840]   as we kind of evolve.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.240]   But one thing that's changed for me,
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.960]   and I'd love your perspective,
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.240]   you know, we did a lot of travel solo,
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.720]   did a lot of travel with my wife,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.920]   backpacking, and now we have kids
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.640]   for people who have a more demanding career,
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.160]   aren't able to work entirely on the road,
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.840]   have kids, have families.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.240]   How do you think that affects the style of travel
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.720]   you've spent years writing about and living?
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:54.800]   What do you think that looks like
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.040]   for the years ahead for you?
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.360]   - Well, you know, I think budget travel
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.600]   is a state of mind more than a style.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.480]   Like, oh, we have to stay in hostels or whatever.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.280]   So for me, like, as long as I'm still doing
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.000]   like the local thing, to me, that's just budget travel.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.800]   I don't think I will change that.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.880]   I already like cruises.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.240]   And whenever I stay at resorts,
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.800]   I'm like, everything here is overpriced.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.160]   I just want to go eat like whatever the locals are eating.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   So I don't really see a lot of change happening in my life.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.920]   I think even as a family, things change, of course,
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.960]   but as long as you're doing that local thing,
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.400]   it's really just more of a like your mindset
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.480]   than it is like, oh, anything else.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.040]   - I think one thing that I'm gonna change,
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.880]   and you already highlighted this,
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.880]   but just having less things to do.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.440]   It's easy to get three or four things done
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.840]   on your own in a day and still have lots of time
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.400]   for exploration.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.720]   With a family, it just feels like one.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.040]   The goal is one thing to accomplish today
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.800]   and let everything else come to chance.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.920]   Or maybe let your kids drive.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.200]   We just had a great conversation with Derek Sivers,
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.360]   who talked about how he traveled with his son.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.160]   And it was just, let him lead and explore
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.160]   through their eyes, which can be very different
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.920]   from exploring through your own.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.000]   This is really reminiscent,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.600]   'cause I did a eight month trip where it was just like this.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.680]   And my wife and I did a lot of this before kids,
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.360]   is just recognizing that a lot of what you're going
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.360]   to experience, like your example in Italy,
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:25.040]   is being in another place, understanding another culture,
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.400]   food, language, and that doesn't require
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.480]   seeing every museum in the town.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.920]   It doesn't require ticking off every five star restaurant.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.240]   It can be a lot different,
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.560]   and it can be a lot more rewarding to do that.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.880]   And even more so if you get outside of the cities.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.840]   Sometimes just where you stay.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.440]   Maybe don't stay in the most central part of town
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.680]   to force yourself to be around locals.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.680]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.680]   I think as you age, you slow down,
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.440]   especially if you have kids, you slow down.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:01.440]   I don't have kids, but I've had a lot of other parents
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.240]   who travel with kids say the same thing.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.400]   They let their kids just go,
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.760]   and their kids will just discover things,
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.000]   and they then discover things.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.360]   One thing I'm gonna wrap with,
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:14.640]   is there a place in the world that if someone were going,
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.440]   you have a few recommendations,
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.400]   maybe it's because you lived there for a while,
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.920]   maybe it's 'cause it's home.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:24.560]   If you go to Paris, go to Le Dit Vin, Le Dit Vin.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.640]   That's a great restaurant.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:29.120]   L-E-D-I-T-V-I-N.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.720]   How would you spend a day in Paris if you only had one?
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.280]   Wander and wander, get some wine, sit on the sand,
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.640]   sit in a park, go to a cafe, and just eat.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.680]   Paris is just great just to be there.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.760]   I don't disagree.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.080]   If people wanna stay on top of everything,
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.440]   you're writing, traveling, posting, where should they head?
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.880]   You find me everywhere at nomadicrad.com,
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.720]   and nomadicrad on social media.
