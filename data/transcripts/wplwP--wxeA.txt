[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   So I want to go and talk a little bit about how you think about making decisions.
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.680]   The decision in someone's mind might be, "Oh, this isn't,
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.840]   I'm not able to do what I want.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.120]   Obviously, I need to move somewhere where I can have more of a balance.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.720]   Let the pendulum go back in the middle."
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.760]   And you said, "Well, maybe there's an alternative.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.200]   Maybe I could go get this deep, you know, intense fix for 10 days that'll
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.000]   hopefully give you, you know, a little high of human interaction for a period
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.280]   to come and sustain you."
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.040]   When you approach decision-making, it sounds like you don't just look
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.560]   at what's the assumed default option of what I could do, you try to really
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.640]   make sure you're casting a wide net at ways to experience things.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.920]   Yes.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.760]   You've written about this.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.160]   I can't remember the URL.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.360]   I don't either right now, but it's one of my favorite things is to be reflective
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.640]   and ask yourself what you really want, and not just limit yourself to a few
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.360]   options from what you see other people doing, but to really kind of dig deep
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.280]   and go like, "Okay, what do I really want?
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.200]   And why do I want that?
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.320]   What's the real point of that?
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.000]   So if I think I want to be on a beach in Thailand right now, well,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.040]   why do I think that?
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.840]   What do I really want?
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.080]   What do I expect will happen when I get there?
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.200]   Why is it that I need a beach in Thailand?
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.400]   Could it be a beach anywhere?
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.240]   Um, is it just the quiet that I want?
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.040]   Um, is it, and you may keep asking yourself these questions and get to
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.960]   the, the actual answer, which is, um, that, uh, yeah, my home is too noisy.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.320]   I hate all the clamoring here.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.800]   I live right above a train station or something, and it's too noisy in my home.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800]   Really what I'm pursuing is the silence.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.520]   Well, do you need to go to Thailand to get silence?
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.080]   Is that the sustainable solution to that?
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.840]   No, maybe I need to soundproof my office.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.000]   And you might come to like, yeah, actually I don't need Thailand, but
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.920]   the money it would take to go to Thailand, I could soundproof my office.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920]   And I really do like living here in Toronto or wherever it is.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.400]   And, uh, so in fact, I'm going to stay here, not go to
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.160]   Thailand and soundproof my office.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.760]   Yes, that's what I really want.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.440]   You know, so if you keep digging into yourself, you might come out with
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.720]   a solution that, uh, that suits your problem better, is there something you do?
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.960]   Maybe it's natural for you.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.960]   I have to assume it is where someone asks you a question or you have an idea and
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.560]   you're able to force yourself to pause and think before kind of going all in on
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.480]   this thing, someone says, Oh, do you want to go here?
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.440]   And you're like, and my default is, do I want to do this thing or not?
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   Not, Oh, what are these other options?
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.520]   Someone asks a question.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.800]   My default is, do I know the answer or not?
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.440]   And if I think I know it, let's answer it right away.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.120]   I don't have the natural instinct to pause and think before.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.840]   And I'm curious, is there something that you've trained yourself to do?
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.240]   Is it, is it natural?
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.080]   Have you thought about how people who maybe don't have
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.880]   that instinct could adopt it?
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.800]   I think it would be beneficial to me, which is why I'm asking.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.720]   I journal like crazy.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.600]   I journal so much.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.720]   Um, and unlike the other things where I say, Hey, you know, not
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.640]   everybody has to do this.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.000]   Everybody has to do this.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.880]   Everybody should do this.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.680]   Uh, it helps so much to pause.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.240]   And it doesn't even matter what pen, paper, text file, you
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.800]   know, Google docs doesn't matter.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.120]   Something where you can stop like every day and ask yourself
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.240]   these reflective questions.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.040]   Like ask yourself questions like, why am I doing this?
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.800]   And what am I really after?
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.560]   Um, what's the point of that?
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.000]   And then you should doubt yourself.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.480]   You should doubt the answers you give yourself.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   So even if you say, um, why do I want this?
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.840]   Because I've always wanted to go to Thailand.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.880]   Challenge yourself, right?
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.480]   Really?
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.280]   Have I always wanted to go to Thailand?
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.680]   Really?
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.360]   Always?
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.160]   Um, why do I think that Thailand is the answer?
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.880]   Like push back on your own answers and just, you know, it can take just an hour
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.800]   of your day and it is so, so useful to, and if you say that I don't have an hour
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.560]   in the day, well, the hell you don't, you know, like turn off other things and do
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.320]   this because where it takes you.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.640]   Makes all the difference in the world.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.560]   And are there prompts that you use or is it just whatever's happening in the day?
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.200]   Uh, yeah, whatever's happening.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.360]   There's not like generic prompts that I'm going to, you know, Hey, everybody
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.640]   write down these five questions to ask yourself every day.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.360]   No, it's not like that.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.160]   It's just use just based on whatever your situation is in the moment.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.000]   Generally you could use, I think, use it to clarify your thinking and to, to
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.320]   think of other options, like you said.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.160]   Like if you think you have no choice, you're always wrong.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.360]   There's always another choice.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.520]   If you think you've only got two choices, well, those aren't options.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.560]   That's a dilemma.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.560]   If you think, if you think you only have two choices, uh, you
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   still haven't thought enough.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.080]   You have to keep thinking of other options.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.720]   You know, you can always add some crazy ones in there.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.360]   Like, okay, option number three, I quit everything and join a monastery.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.600]   Okay.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.200]   Option number four, I go down to my local park and I lay on the bench and
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.520]   I, I don't leave, I become homeless.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.000]   Okay.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.960]   Well now you've added two more options that you don't like.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.280]   Okay.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.000]   You can always keep going and then get more creative, do the brainstorming
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   approach where you're deliberately thinking of out of the box, crazy
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.040]   solutions for your situation, but just keep going until you've got like 10 or
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.320]   20 options and many of my best ideas in life, the ones that I've been the
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:06.360]   happiest with the choices I've made have come from this pushing myself
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.440]   to further solutions, right?
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.960]   It's like, it was actually like solution number 18 that got me the most
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.680]   excited and that's the one I pursued.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.960]   Is there an example of, I thought I was going to do this and this new
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.120]   thing came out that I never was thinking about originally?
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.360]   Ooh, yeah.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.800]   Uh, what's an example?
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.880]   Well, like actually that trip to India that I just took, that was
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.680]   like, that came far down the list.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.720]   At, at first it was like, I think I need to go to the TED conference again,
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.280]   which I haven't been to in 10 years.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.920]   Then it was like, well, I think I just need to go to any conference.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.640]   And then it was like, I think I need, what about a local class here in
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.360]   Wellington, New Zealand, where I live?
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:57.400]   Uh, maybe I can find like a philosophy course here so I can meet other
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.960]   interesting people, uh, that are into this kind of stuff I'm into.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.520]   Um, and then it was like, oh, I could go traveling.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.600]   I could go travel Europe and, and I just kept going.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.080]   And then, yeah, way down the list was like, I could go to India.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.920]   That was like, oh, India.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.120]   Yes.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.760]   Oh my God.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.080]   I haven't been to India in 12 years.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.800]   I know so many people in India and through a weird like thing that
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.680]   I, I married a woman from India.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.280]   I actually, I'm a citizen of India.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.360]   I have the legal right to live in India for the rest of my life.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.760]   I was like, Ooh, see, this one works for me on many levels because
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.600]   this wouldn't just be a travel.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.760]   This wouldn't just be a trip.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.520]   This is like an investment into my future.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.560]   Like it's likely I will live there someday.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.640]   And so getting to know it better now, meeting people now would be an investment
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.600]   into future long-term friendships, not just a quick, you know, romp at a conference.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.440]   Um, so yeah, that came way down the list and that's one example.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.880]   And I was, yeah, again, I just got back from this trip.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.320]   So it's on my mind right now, but I met so many interesting people there
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.200]   and, uh, had so many fascinating conversations.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.680]   It was just what I needed.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.520]   And yeah, that, that solution did not come until I had really spent an hour in my
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.240]   journal thinking of different solutions.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.240]   I love it.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.760]   I'm going to propose for people who might be like me thinking, gosh, journaling.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.960]   I, I want to try, but I'm not sure what, take a, what I hear is take some decision
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.240]   you're thinking about making and maybe just spend an hour by yourself with a
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.400]   notebook, a pen, not a computer, and just kind of think of different ways that
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.000]   you could have a different outcome.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.320]   Like brain instead of journaling, I'm going to call it brainstorming.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.880]   Cause I think we might be more familiar with how to start doing that.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.960]   But at the end of the day, it's just writing things down
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.880]   and thinking about them.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.640]   So you can, you can call it whatever you want.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.680]   Um, but I like this idea.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.440]   Um, and so I don't know.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.760]   I'm, I'm not a good, uh, I'm not a disciplined journaling person, but I feel
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.560]   like I'm going to try to take your advice after this and at least commit to it.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.400]   I'm not disciplined either about it.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.240]   It is absolutely not a discipline to me.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.440]   It's just sanity.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.960]   It's like, I've been doing this since I was a teenager and I'm 53.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:19.720]   Now, so almost every day I hit some point where I need to clarify my thoughts on
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:25.440]   something, what might even be about somebody, like somebody's pissed you off
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.600]   and you find that you're all upset and you need to kind of stop and clarify your
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.760]   thoughts instead of just sitting there and feeling angry and like, wait, why am I
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.520]   feeling angry?
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.680]   What's this really about?
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:42.440]   And so instead of just sitting there on your sofa stewing, it just like open
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.240]   your thing, whatever it is, your paper notebook, or your, in my case, I just use
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   a plain text file.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.160]   I just open up a plain text file and I just start typing.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.320]   Uh, there's no discipline to it at all.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.200]   It's just like, what the hell?
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.400]   I am so angry right now.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   Why am I angry?
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.880]   You know, because this person did that thing.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.760]   Well, so what, why does that matter?
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.040]   Well, because this, and I'll just kind of have this dialogue with myself.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.160]   Like I said, like kind of challenging and pushing back.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.040]   I hear that.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.440]   I don't know much about this, but I've heard that this is similar to something
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.720]   called cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:24.680]   And it is known to be one of the few things that works, uh, for people with
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.840]   depression or anxiety or other major life problems.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.080]   Cognitive behavioral therapy works wonders.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.560]   Um, I heard that a couple of times.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.600]   And when I just looked into what it is, it sounds like it's what I've been doing
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.160]   in my journal since I was a teenager.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:46.360]   So, uh, I could say it in my very undisciplined, uh, way that
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.040]   it's worked wonders for me.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:54.680]   And most of the major life decisions that I've made have come from that process.
