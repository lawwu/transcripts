[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   Instead of having to move around money
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.240]   and make sure your cashflow needs are in order,
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.160]   you can actually just transfer positions
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.720]   that you're holding of stocks or index funds.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.160]   And while they're in transit,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.240]   you're not foregoing your earnings
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.080]   or any growth in those stocks,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.860]   and you don't really need access to them
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.280]   on a day-to-day basis.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.800]   So it's a little bit easier in my mind than a bank bonus
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.240]   because it's kind of less invasive into your cashflow.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.680]   So to evaluate these,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.640]   I looked at 20 different brokerage bonuses,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.280]   and some of them were household names,
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.000]   Schwab, Citi, E-Trade.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800]   Some were fintechs like Robinhood, Webull, and Public.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.680]   And some were brokerages that I wasn't really familiar with
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.760]   like TastyTrade and TradeStation.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.320]   All were brokerages with SIPC protection,
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.680]   which usually protects you,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.320]   I think, on $500,000 of balance.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.800]   Similar but not the same as FDIC insurance.
