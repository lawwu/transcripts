[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:15.640]   the book of the prophet Ezekiel in the thirty-sixth chapter and the twenty-seventh verse. The
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:23.240]   twenty-seventh verse in the thirty-sixth chapter of the book of the prophet Ezekiel, "And
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:32.360]   I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:40.140]   my judgments, and do them." Now I'd better remind you of the context by reading again
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.960]   from the beginning of verse twenty-four, "For I will take you from among the heathen, and
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:55.480]   gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. Then will I
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.600]   sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. From all your filthiness and from
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.180]   all your idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.920]   I put within you. And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.660]   give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:35.700]   in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them." Now I'm calling your attention
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.420]   to this particular twenty-seventh verse and to the surrounding context because here we
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.640]   have a perfect declaration and statement of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.740]   The words have other references. They undoubtedly have a reference to the then condition of
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.540]   the children of Israel. They may well have a reference to some future condition of Israel.
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.180]   But what is abundantly clear and quite unmistakable is that it is also a most amazing, foreshadowing,
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.900]   foretelling of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and what he does to all
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:32.300]   those who believe it. Now I'm calling attention to it and doing it in this particular form
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:41.140]   because it seems to me that more and more men and women who do not enjoy the blessings
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.820]   of this Christian salvation, this Christian message, are in that position and in that
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:58.500]   condition because they have never truly realized what the gospel is and especially what it
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:07.380]   has to offer. There can be no question at all about this. It's a fact which is on the
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.180]   surface almost incredible, but we all know perfectly well that it is a simple fact. That
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:23.540]   because we all tend to think that we know what the gospel is, there is a sense in which
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.980]   we have never heard it until a given particular moment. Because a man who thinks he knows
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.180]   what a thing is, is never prepared to receive instruction. A little learning is a dangerous
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.260]   thing. And people imagine and think that they know exactly what Christianity is. And for
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.100]   that reason, they've never really faced it. They've never really known what it is.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:57.620]   Now this isn't a bit of theory on my part. I'm speaking out of a pastoral experience.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.620]   I'm speaking out of what I know to be the truth. Because as one has the privilege of
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.360]   talking to people about these things here and elsewhere, one is so constantly discovering
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.660]   that there's some basic misconception, some failure to understand or to grasp one of the
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.860]   very first principles of the gospel of Christ. There is only one explanation of all this,
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.020]   of course, and that is that it is the result of the work of the adversary of God and the
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.140]   adversary of the souls of men, the devil, who insinuating a false idea of Christianity
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:46.460]   into our minds never allows us, in a sense, as best he can, to face what is actually the
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.700]   truth. Well now then, you see, as we look at this description of the gospel, I think
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:05:01.360]   that point becomes abundantly clearer. Now there is no failure on the part of men and
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.660]   women with respect to the gospel which is perhaps quite as great as this. It is a failure
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:15.740]   to understand and to grasp the completeness of the gospel. All along we tend to stop at
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:23.480]   certain points, and because we stop at those points, well, we not only never have an adequate
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.640]   conception of the gospel as it is itself, but to that extent also we fail to reap the
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.100]   benefits which it can give to us. Now as we go on, therefore, from step to step
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:45.700]   in this picture that we have here of the gospel, that point, I think, comes out very clearly.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.740]   Now you notice the statement is put in general in this way, that what Christianity offers
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.580]   to do is to deliver us out of a captivity. It is something that will take hold of us
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:05.180]   and bring us out amongst the heathen, and bring us back to the place where God intended
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:13.300]   men to be and where God will bless him. That's really the whole purpose of this Christian
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.340]   message. It isn't just a call or an invitation to you and to me to do certain things. It
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.940]   is that, but long before it comes to that, it first of all announces what God is going
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:34.700]   to do to us. We need to be delivered. We need to be set free. And that is what the gospel
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.380]   does. Well then, it goes on to tell us how this
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.700]   happens, and I've been emphasizing the all-importance of taking these things in the order in which
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:51.500]   they are given here, which is exactly the order in which they are given in the New Testament.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:59.460]   The first thing we all need in this life and in this world is forgiveness. We need to be
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:07.300]   cleansed from our sin and from the guilt of our sin. We need to be washed. We need to
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:16.420]   be sprinkled clean from all our filthiness and all our idols. And the gospel offers to
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:26.820]   do that through Jesus Christ and him crucified. His blood can make the foulest clean. His
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:34.420]   blood availed for me. But it doesn't stop at that. It only starts
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:40.060]   there. Let us never forget that it does start there. What you need, my friend, if you're
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.980]   not a Christian at this moment, what you need first of all is not help, it's forgiveness.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:52.620]   And you'll never have any help from God until he's forgiven you. We need to be in the right
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.540]   relationship to God before God will bless us. God is not going to bless those who are
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:04.460]   not reconciled to him. The first thing is to be brought back to God into the true living
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:12.020]   relationship. You must start there, and that implies forgiveness and reconciliation.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:23.100]   But then we have seen also that we need in addition to that a new kind of faculty. Why
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.780]   is man in misery and in wretchedness? Why does he sin? Why does he ever need forgiveness?
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:34.340]   What's the matter? Well, the matter is this, that he's got a mind and a heart that are
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:41.340]   alienated from God. He's become an enemy of God and regards God as his enemy. And so
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:49.020]   we need a new nature, a new heart, a new understanding. And we've seen that God also promises to
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:54.420]   give us that. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:02.260]   He's going to take out the stony heart, this obdurate heart that's impervious to truth,
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:08.300]   and he's going to give us a heart that can understand and comprehend. He enables us,
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:18.820]   in other words, to think spiritually and to be interested in spiritual truth. Very well.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:27.540]   But you see, even that isn't all. And it's here we begin to see more clearly the comprehensive
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:36.100]   character of this salvation. It doesn't stop there. And it doesn't stop there because
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:46.140]   that in and of itself is really not enough. Now we've arrived at this point. We can see
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:52.700]   that our sins are forgiven because Jesus Christ has borne them in his own body on the tree
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:58.620]   and has suffered their penalty and their punishment. And thereby we are washed, if you like, in
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:05.820]   the blood of Christ. And our sins have been removed, though your sins be a scarlet. They
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:12.420]   shall be as white as snow. We are reconciled to God through Jesus Christ, who has been
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:21.900]   made sin for us. All right. We've now got some kind of understanding of this truth.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:32.140]   Ah, yes, but this leaves us with this problem. How are we to live this Christian life? That's
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.820]   the question. You see, God says he's going to bring these people back from Babylon and
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:43.980]   their captivity back to their own land. Yes, but what's the point of doing that in a sense
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.340]   if they're just the same as they were before? Because it was in that land they went wrong.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.700]   It was there that they sinned and turned their backs upon God. Won't they do the same again?
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.940]   It's all very well to be brought back to Canaan, but how are we going to live a godly life
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:06.740]   in Canaan? How can we keep God's commandments? How can we honor his judgments?
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:13.400]   Now that is the next problem which confronts us. And I think this is a point at which many
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:24.300]   people stumble as they consider this gospel. It's this whole problem of the need of power,
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:32.340]   this whole question of the need of strength and of help. How often have people put it
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:38.820]   like this? We all, I'm sure, have felt it at some time or another. We listen to the
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:46.300]   gospel and we say, "Oh, that's wonderful. I can see that my past can be forgotten, that
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:56.620]   my sins are blotted out. I see this new understanding, this new insight into truth. And I'm on the
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:04.780]   verge, as it were, of giving into it and yielding to it, when suddenly I think, 'Oh, it's
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:11.820]   all very well to believe that and to give myself to God and to Christ in this meeting,
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:17.340]   but how can I live the life? I feel the power of it while I'm sitting here in a chapel
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:23.980]   and listening to it, or as I read it at certain times. And I want to give myself to it. I'd
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:33.420]   like to be like that. But I know that in a sense the whole thing is futile, because I
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:41.060]   know that if I do that in this service or in some similar service, well, I'm still
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:48.180]   the same person and I've got to go back and out into the same world, and London will
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.820]   still be London, though I've been in a service and have felt powerful things. The world and
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:13:02.180]   the flesh and the devil don't change. And I know that my own nature is weak. How often
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.540]   have I felt I'd like to live a better life? How often have I wished that I could live
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.660]   a better life? How often have I tried to live a better life? And I've really meant it,
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:16.660]   and I've taken my resolutions, I've made my vows, I've promised others, and I've
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:22.540]   meant it and I've intended it, and I've done my utmost, but I've failed and failed
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:32.880]   miserably. So what can I do about it? It's all very well in a sense to talk about being
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:38.500]   put back into Canaan, but the question is, what guarantee have I that I'm going to
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:45.940]   be different from what I was before? How can I obey God and live this godly life? Now I
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:51.460]   say that there are many who have stumbled at that. They don't want, as they say, to
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.140]   make fools of themselves. They're afraid of being carried away at the moment. They
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:02.420]   say there is the stark reality of life and its temptations, its problems and its difficulties.
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:12.780]   And my own weakness. Very well. You see, such people have never realized what we are told
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:19.580]   in this 27th verse of the 36th chapter of Ezekiel's prophecy. "Having done the other
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:32.380]   things, and I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:42.060]   ye shall keep my judgments and do them." Now again I've got to emphasize a principle
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:50.580]   which has been recurring right through our consideration of this passage. You notice
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:59.580]   that it is still God's action. You still notice this blessed eye. Oh, here's the
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:04.620]   initial error I sometimes think that men and women forget that salvation is God's work
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:10.180]   from the very beginning to the very end. The gospel of Jesus Christ doesn't ask you to
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:15.380]   make yourself a Christian. It doesn't ask you to change your life. It knows you can't.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:20.020]   It knows that you can make some superficial reformation, but you can't change your nature.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:25.460]   The leopard cannot change his skin. The Ethiopian cannot change his skin, nor the leopard his
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:31.860]   spots. No, no, it's God who's going to do all these things, and God is going to do
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:44.500]   this further thing. What is it? Well, this you notice is the promise of the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:50.100]   And there is nothing more wonderful about the gospel than this. Indeed, in many ways
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:16:00.340]   it is the very essence of this Christian message, this Christian faith. Here Ezekiel looks forward
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:07.460]   to the day of Pentecost and to the marvelous and the wonderful thing that happened there
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:13.060]   when the ascended glorified Son of God sent down and poured forth his Holy Spirit upon
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:18.620]   the church, and such amazing and astonishing things happened. It's a part of this gospel
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:26.140]   of salvation. It's a part of this message of redemption. God is going to do this further
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:35.540]   thing. Now let me show you how vital it is to grasp this. If you read that book of the
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:43.340]   Acts of the Apostles, you simply cannot understand it apart from this particular promise. Look
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:49.580]   at those people, people like the Apostle Peter and others whom we read about in the gospels,
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:55.820]   and who cut such a sorry figure, and who can be and were such miserable failures. Look
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.780]   at a man like Peter, who when he was challenged as to whether he belonged to Jesus Christ
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:08.060]   said, "I don't know the man," and did it three times, denied him with oaths and cursing.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:13.860]   And he did it all simply to save his own skin because he was a coward, because he was afraid
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:20.780]   of death. There he is. Look at all those disciples, fumbling, stumbling. Our Lord speaks to them,
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:25.700]   tells them about his death and resurrection. They can't grasp it, they can't understand
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:31.220]   it, they object to it. What fools they seem to be, what simpletons. And then look at them
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:39.620]   in the Acts of the Apostles. How entirely and absolutely different they are. What a
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:46.580]   boldness appears in Peter. What an understanding of the scriptures, what an ability to preach.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:51.260]   These men, says someone, who have turned the world upside down, have come hither also.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.060]   But they were just ordinary fishermen, ignorant men in a sense, and yet they were able to
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:04.820]   work miracles and to do marvelous things. What is it? The answer is that God had fulfilled
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:12.500]   what he'd prophesied here through Ezekiel, "I will put my spirit within you." The
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:18.900]   Acts of the Apostles, as we sometimes call the book, is really the Acts of the Holy Ghost
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:27.540]   in and through the apostles. It is this energy, this power, this divine strength, this affluence
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:36.140]   that comes upon them. That's the explanation. Indeed, you can't understand the story of
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:42.220]   the Christian church throughout the centuries apart from this. This power that has gone
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:50.340]   into pagan lands and has revolutionized the lives of people, cannibals becoming saints,
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:55.980]   men and women sitting in the darkness of the squalor and the filth of sin becoming noble
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:02.060]   citizens. What is it? Is it merely education? Well, if it is, why doesn't it do it in
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:08.460]   this country? Is it the mere exhortations of men? Why doesn't it do it everywhere?
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:14.660]   No, no, there's only one answer. It's this power of the Holy Spirit. It's this energy
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:23.980]   of God. And therefore I say it is absolutely vital that we should understand it. And it's
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:29.900]   not only true in general like that in the whole history of the church. You'll never
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:38.340]   understand the life of a single individual Christian unless you grasp this. Christianity
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:43.780]   is the most revolutionary force that this world has ever known. This is something that
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.740]   really does so change men that not only do other people have difficulty in recognizing
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:55.140]   them to be the same, they find it extremely difficult to recognize themselves. There is
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:00.780]   no more perfect statement of Christianity than that of Paul in Galatians 2.20, "I
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:11.860]   live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." I am myself. I'm not myself. I am solitarsis,
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:17.380]   but patently I'm not. I'm the Apostle Paul. I'm a new man. I'm a new creation.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:27.780]   What is it? The power of the Holy Spirit. Oh, go through that book of Acts again. Look
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:33.780]   at solitarsis. Look at his conversion there in the ninth chapter. Read it. Look at the
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.740]   other cases. Look at the Philippian jailer on the verge of committing suicide in desperation,
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:47.900]   the next moment rejoicing in God with all his house. What is this? Go through and read
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:53.020]   the biographies of the saints of the centuries. You're able philosopher, and yet you're
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:58.460]   dissolute, immoral man, Augustine of Hippo. What is it? I see him now, a doctor of the
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.940]   church, a great saint. What's happened to him? Has he got a new philosophy? No, no,
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:10.620]   it isn't that. It's a power that has entered his life. It's the power of this Holy Spirit.
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:16.620]   My dear friends, this is a vital part of Christianity. This isn't just a little moral teaching,
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.740]   you know. This isn't just a new ideology. This isn't some idea that you put over to
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:29.900]   men. No, no, men cannot be changed fundamentally by ideas. They can change their ideas, and
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.500]   up to a point it'll affect their lives. That isn't the gospel. The gospel is the
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:44.020]   Holy Spirit being put into us by God himself, and it's something absolutely different.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:49.940]   Now then, you see, that this is absolutely basic and central. Had you realized that,
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:58.100]   I wonder. Is there somebody doubtful and hesitant about Christianity? Are you afraid of some
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.780]   future failure? Are you saying, "What's the use of giving myself if I know I'm going
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.820]   to fail tomorrow because of what I am, because the world is what it is?" My friend, the
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:15.500]   answer is, "I will put my spirit, my spirit, within you." That's Christianity. This
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:21.620]   gospel of the Spirit sent by Christ to those for whom he's died and to whom he's given
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:27.620]   the new mind and understanding and enlightenment. He goes on, "I will put my spirit within
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:40.020]   you." Oh, what a doctrine. "My spirit." What's it mean? Well, it's the great doctrine
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:49.060]   of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is none other than the third person in the blessed
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:58.900]   Holy Trinity. That's what Christianity means. I've often quoted it before from this pulpit.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:05.740]   Let me say it again to establish this point. John Wesley, no mean judge in these matters,
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:12.940]   used to say that his favorite definition of Christianity was the title of a book that
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:17.980]   he'd read by a man called Henry Scougal, a Scotsman who'd lived towards the end of
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:25.940]   the 17th century. Henry Scougal wrote a book and this was its title, "The Life of God
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:36.020]   in the Souls of Men." That's Christianity. The Holy Spirit, the third person in the Trinity,
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:41.940]   God, the Holy Spirit. There are three persons there. Don't try to understand this. I don't
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:50.380]   understand it. One God in three persons. God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:55.300]   That's my spirit and God says, "I will put him within you." The Holy Spirit comes
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:02.460]   to dwell within the believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and revolutionizes his life. Nothing
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.220]   less than that.
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:12.940]   Be clear then about the person of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not just an influence,
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:18.820]   he's not just a power. The Holy Spirit is a person, as much a person as the Lord Jesus
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:25.380]   Christ was, as much as God the Father is. And here is this wonderful thing, the Holy
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:30.860]   Spirit, the third person, is going to take up his tabernacle within us and dwell in our
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:40.300]   very bodies. It's a great and an extensive doctrine. I'm not going into it this evening.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:51.900]   I simply want to emphasize one aspect. His power, the power of the Godhead, the power
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:56.500]   of the Holy Spirit that has been doing the things that I've been describing to you,
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:01.300]   it's all in that book of Acts, it's everywhere in the history of the Church. His might, his
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:15.100]   power, it's invincible, it is irresistible. There is no limit to what he can do. And God
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:23.580]   puts his spirit, this spirit, this person with this power within our lives. And so he
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:32.180]   enables us to keep his commandments and to carry out his judgments. Very well. The question
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:39.740]   confronting us is, how does he do this? Now there are many answers to that question in
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:45.500]   the New Testament. I read one of them to you at the beginning in the seventh chapter of
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:51.580]   the epistle to the Romans, a most perfect statement of the problem and the answer. It's
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:57.700]   all in a verse, as a matter of fact, in the epistle to the Philippians in the second chapter
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:06.540]   and in verses 12 and 13. "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:14.860]   it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good pleasure." Now then,
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.300]   let's interpret this in the light of those statements and let me divide it up for you
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:29.540]   like this. How am I to live this godly life? Well, the answer is that God the Holy Spirit
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:38.340]   works within. Let me put it like this in a preliminary manner. And I know nothing about
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:46.940]   this gospel that is more wonderful than this. You are not left to yourself. God doesn't
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.900]   just forgive you and give you a new insight and understanding and then just leave you
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:57.540]   to yourself to battle it all out. No, no. He puts his Spirit within you. You are not
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:09.100]   left and abandoned in this struggle against sin. He comes to you. He takes up his abode
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:18.060]   in you. And his energy and his might and his power begin to work within you. Now, you remember
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:23.180]   our Lord, just before his death he offered up a great prayer. It's called the High
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:28.660]   Priestly Prayer. You'll find it in the seventeenth chapter of John's Gospel and amongst other
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:39.940]   things he offered this petition. "Father, sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:48.140]   is truth." You see, this was the position. The Lord Jesus Christ was about to be crucified,
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:54.020]   about to die and rise again and go back to heaven. And here he leaves this handful of
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:28:04.700]   followers, simple, ignorant, fallible, frail men. Men whom Satan had defeated and had got
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:10.420]   down. Men who, as I said, had failed in so many respects. He leaves just this handful
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:16.140]   and his whole honor is in their hands. He says, "I am glorified in them." He leaves
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:21.700]   them in this great world, opposed to him so opposed to him that it crucified him. Opposed
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:29.460]   to the devil and opposed to hell. What chance do they stand? Ah, he prays for them. "Sanctify
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:37.180]   them through thy truth. Thy word is truth." He'd already told them that if he went and
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.980]   after he'd gone he would send his spirit upon them. Well, now here it is, the spirit
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:51.940]   and the word and God answering the prayer by sending the Holy Spirit upon them. And
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:29:02.820]   what he does, of course, is to work in us in order to produce that desired end.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:07.860]   Now I want to make this particularly clear because people have often been confused about
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:17.980]   this. You notice that this is still the action of God. As God says, "I will sprinkle clean
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.820]   water upon you." As he says, "A new heart also I will give you and a new spirit will
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:28.620]   I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:35.580]   you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you." Notice how definite and certain
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:43.780]   it is, "And I will cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:54.380]   and do them." What do you mean, says someone? Well, I mean this. There are some people who
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:30:01.060]   seem to think and to say and to teach, alas, that you can accept your forgiveness and your
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:09.620]   justification from God and decide either to accept or refuse this further offer of sanctification.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:15.380]   To me that is a denial not only of this verse but of the whole teaching of the New Testament
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:22.980]   on this subject of sanctification. There is no gap between justification and sanctification.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:28.180]   The God who is going to wash me is the God who puts his spirit within me. It is all his
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:36.940]   action. You can't be a Christian who is just forgiven and no more. There is no such
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:43.540]   thing. The process is one. There are steps and stages and it is God who takes the first
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:49.140]   and the second and the third. It is he who manipulates it all. Work out your own salvation.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:31:02.800]   It is God that worketh in you. I'll tell you why I'm emphasizing this. It would be
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:12.940]   inconsistent in God just to redeem us and to rescue us and to reconcile us to himself
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:22.780]   and then leave us as we were. Why did God send his Son into this world to die for sinners?
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:29.260]   You think it can possibly stop at forgiveness and leave us as we were? I say it's unworthy
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:36.900]   of God. What a vast, what a grand concept this salvation is from beginning to end. Can
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:41.740]   God leave it like that? It's incredible. It's impossible. And indeed he says specifically
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:46.140]   that he's not going to leave it at that. God is not going to put us back there and
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:51.380]   leave us as we were. No, no. He's going to make certain that we keep his commandments.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:32:02.940]   I will do this. Why did Christ die? Was it merely that you and I might be forgiven? Well,
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:11.100]   the New Testament doesn't say that. It says this, "Who gave himself for us that he might
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:26.500]   separate unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works." He died that we might be
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:33.100]   forgiven. Thank God, but it doesn't stop there. He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:41.660]   He died to make us good. Can he possibly leave the job half finished? It's an insult to
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:48.580]   God. No, no. When God starts this process of salvation, he goes on with it. He cannot
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:54.220]   leave us just justified alone. No, no. The moment we are justified and born again, this
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:33:01.660]   whole process has already started and the giving of the Spirit guarantees it.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:07.020]   But my friends, I want to make this very plain and clear because to me it is a very vital
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:19.820]   matter. I read a statement the other day by Charles Finney, Charles G. Finney. You've
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:25.460]   read of Finney and of the revivals that took place under his ministry in America over a
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:33.140]   hundred years ago. Well, I read this in an article written by Finney in 1840 in the Oberlin
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:47.700]   Evangelist. Thousands of people had been converted under his ministry, but by now Finney had
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:54.500]   ceased to be an evangelist and he was teaching in a college. And looking back he said this,
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:02.660]   "Most of these converts of mine are a disgrace to Christianity." He said, "If I had my
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:10.700]   time over again as an evangelist, I'd preach nothing but holiness." Very well then, my
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:15.260]   friends, let's be clear about this, I say. So let me quote to you from the first epistle
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:28.820]   of John. "If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:35.180]   do not the truth." If we say we have fellowship with him, by which we mean this, that we believe
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:40.900]   that Christ has died for us to reconcile us to God. All right, do you say that you believe
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:46.180]   that Christ died for you? If you do, says John, if you say that you have fellowship
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:52.820]   with God in Jesus Christ and him crucified, and yet walk in darkness, go on living in
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:35:00.740]   darkness, we lie and do not the truth. But in the second chapter of that first epistle
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:10.740]   John goes further and he says this in verse 4, "He that saith, I know him, God, and keepeth
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:20.100]   not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him." You know it's a very serious
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:26.140]   thing this. If you say that you're a Christian because Christ has died for you and are still
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:36.380]   living the life of sin, you're a liar, says John. It's his language, not mine. "But
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:43.940]   whosoever keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected. Hereby know
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:53.580]   we that we are in him." So if you claim to be in Christ and that you believe Christ
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:58.740]   has purchased your redemption and has reconciled you to God and you're rejoicing that you're
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:07.780]   in Christ, that's the way to know it. Because you are keeping the commandments of God. You
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:12.380]   can't separate these things. You can't stop at forgiveness. You can't stop at the
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:17.860]   rebirth. You must go on to this, the giving of the Spirit who enables us by his power.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:26.500]   Well now then, how does he do this? "It is God that worketh in you," says Paul.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:32.180]   How does he do the work? Well, he answers his own question. He worketh in us both to
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:43.420]   will and to do. And you see, both these things are necessary in us. Because as we are by
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:56.140]   nature we don't will these things. We don't want to. We've got a carnal mind. And our
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:01.900]   wills are opposed to the will of God. The natural mind is enmity against God, is not
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:07.140]   subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. And that is what we all are by nature.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:13.220]   Nobody need deny that. It's a fact, isn't it? We all of us by nature are rebels against
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:21.060]   God. And our wills are opposed to God. Very well then, the first thing that I need is
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:26.900]   that something be done to my will. And the Holy Spirit does it. "It is God that worketh
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:35.900]   in us both to will." What does he do? Well, this is what he does. He first of all shows
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:43.900]   us sin for what it really is. This prophet Ezekiel puts this very clearly in the 31st
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:50.980]   verse of this chapter. He says, "Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:58.100]   that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:03.460]   for your abominations." Of course, while they were doing these things they didn't loathe
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.420]   them, and they didn't loathe themselves. But after the Spirit has come they look back and
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.340]   they say, "Is it possible that I ever lived like that? Could I ever have sunk to so low
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:23.940]   a level and been so vile and so utterly abominable?" Ah, that's the work of the Spirit. "It is
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:31.980]   he alone who can show us sin for what it is and as it is, in its vileness, its ugliness,
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:38.820]   its foulness. What a horrible thing it is. Oh, I'm not only thinking of drunkenness,
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:45.580]   you know, and adultery and murder. I'm thinking of jealousy and envy and spite and malice
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:51.340]   and ambition, one of the ugliest of all. Oh, what a foul, horrible thing it is. But it
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:56.460]   takes the Spirit to make us see that, and he does it, and thereby he's already beginning
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:03.700]   to influence the will. When you see its horror, you hate it and you don't want it. But he
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:12.660]   also shows us the beauty of holiness. Oh, what a clean thing it is. What a pure thing
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:22.140]   it is. I remember once a woman who'd been a paid medium amongst the spiritualists. I
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:29.420]   remember such a woman being converted and becoming a Christian. And I said to her, "Well,
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.860]   now, how did it happen?" And she said, "Well, this is how it happened. I'll leave out the
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:38.500]   details. She was prevented in a most extraordinary way from going to a spiritualist meeting where
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:43.820]   she was to be a medium and to be paid two guineas for being one, and she had to come
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:48.780]   into a Christian service." I said, "Well, now, what happened?" She said, "Well, this
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:55.300]   was the first thing that happened, and the thing," she said, "I could never forget again.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:03.260]   I came," she said, "into that meeting, and I was conscious that there was a similar power
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:09.620]   in that chapel as there had been in our spiritualist meetings, but there was this tremendous difference.
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:17.740]   This seemed to be clean." She was not only conscious of power, she was conscious of something
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:27.340]   clean that she'd never known before. The evil forces are very powerful. There are evil spirits
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:32.180]   and don't depreciate their might and their strength, but they're vile, they're ugly,
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:40.940]   they're foul spirits. But this Spirit is the Holy Spirit, and He gives us a glimpse of
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:49.460]   the beauty of holiness, the saintly life, the life of Christ Himself and those who followed
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:54.980]   Him most closely. And as the result of this, you see, He begins to create a desire within
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:41:01.020]   us to be like that and to have that holiness which we hated before and laughed at we now
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:08.900]   desire. Our Lord said, "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:13.820]   for they shall be filled." My friend, do you think it's possible that a man who's
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:19.500]   lived a lifetime steeped in sin and in the gutters of vileness can ever desire and hunger
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:25.540]   and thirst after holiness and righteousness? It happens. It's precisely what the Holy
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:31.260]   Spirit does. The man himself could never do it, but the Holy Spirit can do it and He does
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:43.500]   it. But then you see He goes on and He shows us our own true nature and character. I needn't
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:50.060]   keep you. Paul has said it all for us in the 7th of Romans. "I now see sin in its vileness,
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.380]   I see the beauty of holiness. I want to be like that. I'm going to be like that,"
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:42:04.740]   I say. "And then this is what I find, to will is present with me. But how to perform,
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:11.540]   I know not. With my mind I desire to observe the law of God, but I find another law in
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:20.180]   my members opposed to the law of my mind. The evil that I would not that I do and the
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:26.100]   good that I would I do not. Oh, wretched man that I am! I'm hopeless. I'm two men,
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:31.140]   I'm pulling against myself. It's a perpetual tug of war. There's a contradiction in my
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:37.140]   nature. There's a horrible dualism in my life. What can I do? It's hopeless. Oh,
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:46.100]   wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me? I cannot." Have you ever come to that,
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:55.340]   my friend? You know nothing but the Holy Spirit ever makes a man speak like that. A natural
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.580]   man doesn't speak like that, does he? He can do anything. He's got it in him to live
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:05.060]   a life like Christ. He talks about the imitation of Christ. He talks about changing his life.
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:12.960]   He made a change. He puts himself right with God. That's the natural man. When the Holy
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:18.340]   Spirit has worked in a man, he's not only given to see the horror of sin, the beauty
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:27.100]   of holiness, but his own tragic weakness. The law in the members dragging me down so
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:36.780]   that I'm a mass of contradictions and paralyzed in failure. That's how he works in me to
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:47.700]   will. Oh, he creates a longing and a desperation, and I cry out. I need power. I need strength.
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:52.900]   I need something within me that can enable me to do what I want to do and to cease doing
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:44:06.140]   what I hate. It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do. This is where the
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:18.700]   power comes in. He breaks the power of cancelled sin. He sets the prisoner free. The Holy Spirit,
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:32.180]   with his divine might, enables me to mortify the deeds of the body within me. Though I'm
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:41.540]   forgiven, they're still there. Though I'm regenerate, they're still there. These powers
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:47.580]   in the body that drag us down, it is only the might and the strength of the Holy Spirit
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:52.380]   that can enable me to mortify them, to strangle them.
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:58.980]   "If ye," says Paul in the eighth chapter of the epistle to the Romans in verse 13,
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:10.740]   "but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live." And without
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:16.460]   the power and the strength of the Spirit, no man can mortify the deeds of the body.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:22.860]   It's impossible, but with the Spirit it becomes possible. Not only that, you see,
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:32.140]   he enables one to live this divine life. He enables one to live the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:37.220]   Surely you say, "Impossible." The Sermon on the Mount says, "Love your enemies."
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:45.300]   Can any man do that? No, not in his own strength, but filled with the Spirit he can.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:53.780]   Do you remember the story of a man called Stephen? A man who was filled with this Holy
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:46:01.380]   Spirit, and there they are stoning him. He'd done them no wrong, he'd done no harm. He
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:07.500]   was simply a Christian, and they stone him in anger and in wrath, and there he is dying.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:11.460]   And do you know what he's doing as he's dying? He's kneeling and praying, and this
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:25.660]   is what he prays, "Father, lay not this sin to their charge." He is loving his enemies.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:32.860]   The power of the Spirit within him is enabling him to live the life that the Son of God himself
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:38.140]   lived, and who taught us to love our enemies, and to do good to them that hate us, and to
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:47.460]   pray for them that use us despitefully and malign us, he enables us. And he alone can
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:54.460]   and does. And you know he'll give you spiritual abilities that will amaze you and astound
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:59.980]   you. I've often put it like this. Do you know that he takes the work of the power and
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:07.460]   the power of the Holy Spirit to enable a man to enjoy the Bible? I'm not surprised that
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:14.060]   men say they find the Bible dull and boring. The Bible must be dull and boring to every
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:20.420]   man who hasn't got the power of the Spirit within him. It is only the energy of the Spirit
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:29.980]   that can give you understanding and appreciation. Isn't prayer an impossible task? Haven't
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.660]   you all given up in despair many times when you've been trying to pray? What a task
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:40.540]   is prayer! It is. It's a task that's impossible to the natural men, but with the energy of
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:50.620]   the Spirit, one can pray. Oh, let me even put it like this. It's one thing to talk,
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:55.780]   it's another thing to preach. It's one thing to deliver a sermon, it's another
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:02.500]   thing to speak in the energy of the Spirit. And I can assure you that there is almost
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:10.420]   an eternity of difference between the two things. He alone can enable one truly to preach
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:18.540]   the gospel. Oh, let the Apostle Paul sum it all up as he always does in this great phrase.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:31.420]   I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. There is one who is able to keep us from
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:39.940]   falling and to present us faultless before the presence of God's glory with exceeding
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:45.980]   joy. That's how he does the work, in the will and the doing. He prepares the mind,
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:50.300]   he creates the desire, he leads everything to it, and then after we've seen it, he
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:57.420]   gives the energy divine, the power that amazes a man himself, and he asks, "Is it I? Is
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:05.700]   it possible?" And my last point is this. He will continue with this work until we are
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:14.700]   perfect and entire and faultless and blameless without any spot. I will put my Spirit within
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:26.420]   you and I will cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:35.860]   He which hath begun a good work in us, says Paul, will perform it until the day of Jesus
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:43.500]   Christ. Oh yes, let me quote Jude again. He is not only able to keep us from falling but
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:52.500]   to present us faultless. He is going to deal with us in his energy until we shall be without
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:58.580]   spot or wrinkle or any such thing. Listen again to the Apostle in the fifth of Ephesians.
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:08.140]   Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that in order that he might sanctify
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:15.340]   and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:21.860]   a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:33.860]   and without blemish. That's why he gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:42.220]   and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:54.540]   a glorious church. You see, he is going to do it. And I say it with reverence, he must
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:51:04.540]   do it. For in him nothing unclean shall enter in. With antedogs and sorcerers and murderers
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:11.300]   and adulterers, says the book of Revelation, nothing unclean or impure shall enter in.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:20.140]   How can anybody dwell in the presence of God that has a vestige of impurity? It's impossible.
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:27.300]   We must be delivered and cleansed from sin. We must be enabled to satisfy God's law
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:35.180]   and demand, and the Holy Spirit guarantees that. And he will go on with the work within
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:45.340]   us until we shall stand before him entire and absolutely perfect.
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:58.940]   My friend, I have but one question to ask you as I close. Is this work going on in you?
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:07.260]   Are you aware of the working of the Holy Spirit within you? Is he working in your will? Is
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:16.580]   he disturbing you? Do you still find the commandments of God grievous? Do you feel the Christian
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:22.300]   life is horribly narrow? Do you think it would be a terrible thing to spend a week with Jesus
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:32.260]   Christ because of the way he lived and what he didn't do? Is all this revolting to you?
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:39.620]   Is it harsh and cruel? Is your heart still in the world? Are you loving that kind of
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:48.060]   life? Well, if you are, you know it's no use telling me that you believe that Christ died
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:56.020]   for you because the people he died for, he died to separate them from that and to separate
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:02.180]   them unto himself that they might be a holy people. He died not merely that they might
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:09.140]   be forgiven and go on like that. No, no, he's preparing us for heaven and for glory. I ask,
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:14.740]   is this work going on in you? It's a part of the process and the steps are all interlinked
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:26.140]   and it's indivisible. Are you aware of the energy of the Spirit of God within you? You
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:34.300]   are not redeemed otherwise. Do you know what it is to be filled with despair about yourself?
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:40.380]   Are you hungering and thirsting after righteousness? Do you want to be like Christ and be nearer
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:45.380]   to him and to know him? Are you looking forward to spending eternity with him? I say there's
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:50.740]   no value in believing that you've given yourself to Christ unless there's some evidence of
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:54:03.220]   this. There is no separation between justification and sanctification. His commandments are not
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:11.540]   grievous to those for whom he's died and who belong to him. Very well then, I ask,
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:21.460]   do you know that God has put his Spirit within you? And are you aware of his presence? And
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:27.340]   are you aware that you're being dealt with and molded and manipulated? Are you aware
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:39.060]   of another who has come into you and who is drawing you away from the world and drawing
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:48.300]   you to Christ and making him increasingly precious in your sight? Don't talk to me
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:57.260]   about the blood of Christ unless it has awakened in you longings, aspirations after holiness
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:05.740]   and to be like him. Thank God for such a complete salvation, for such an entire, for such a
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:15.500]   whole salvation. Thank God that a day is coming when we shall indeed be perfect and stand
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:24.700]   faultless before the presence of God's glory with exceeding joy. If it's going on within
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:30.700]   you, God bless you. Yield to him more and more. But if you're doubtful or uncertain
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:37.700]   or unhappy, make no tarrying. Go to God and confess it, acknowledge it. Say, tell him
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:43.260]   that you've been making merchandise of the blood of his Son as an excuse for sin. Ask
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:54.220]   him to send the Spirit and to begin the mighty operation. And give yourself no rest nor peace
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:56:01.420]   until you know that the Spirit of God is in you and that he's working in you mightily,
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:10.260]   both to will and to do. And as the result, you are working out your own salvation with
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:14.860]   fear and trembling. Amen.
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:18.940]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
