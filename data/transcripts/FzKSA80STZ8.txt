[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   Today, we're announcing that we just raised $45 million from Insight Partners and others. I can't
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.320]   believe how fast this company has grown, but I've been in the ML space for quite a long time.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.280]   When I was even an undergrad, I remember building my first machine learning model and just
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.760]   seeing the power of almost feeling like I was breathing life into a machine.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.120]   I really thought that ML was the future back then. There weren't a lot of jobs out there for
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.560]   someone wanting to do ML at the time. I started a company to help collect training data with my
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.680]   co-founder, Chris. It was honestly hard for a long time. There weren't many people doing
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.080]   machine learning. The applications felt mostly research-oriented. It's been really satisfying
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.480]   to see this big change in the last few years as ML goes from maybe showing you better advertisements
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.920]   to really world transforming things like our work with Blue River, where they're making
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.560]   agriculture work with less pesticides and lower environmental impact, to our work with Pandora,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.840]   where they're recommending better music, to the work that we're doing with autonomous vehicle
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.520]   companies that could really reduce emissions by having cars drive more efficiently.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.080]   All this stuff really matters. As the impact gets bigger of what machine learning does,
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.880]   the problems get bigger and the downside of a broken model becomes bigger and bigger.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.840]   It needs to move from this research topic to reliable production systems. That's always what
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.520]   I've been really passionate about. It's really the applications that really get me excited.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.440]   The place where me and my co-founders, Sean and Chris, felt like we could add the most
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   value in the world is making tools that supported ML practitioners themselves with the pain points
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.520]   that happen in their day-to-day lives. We started off by just going around a couple of years ago
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.920]   and talking to ML teams and talking to people building models and saying, "What do you need?"
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.040]   The first thing that came up was experiment tracking. Building experiment tracking tool
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.680]   at the time really felt like an experiment. We didn't feel like that was a category thing. It
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.080]   felt like maybe it was too niche and no one would care about it, but it really took off like crazy.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.800]   It's been super fun to see how many people have come to rely on the stuff that we're building.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.920]   We've gotten front row seats to seeing all the amazing stuff that's going on in machine learning
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.840]   right now, from pharma applications to all the stuff that I was talking about.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.720]   With this money, what gets me super excited is that now we can build even more tools for ML
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.520]   practitioners who we've really come to love through this journey. You'll see things like
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.320]   model evaluation. You'll see things like dataset versioning, all these things that
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.480]   are day-to-day pain points in the life of ML practitioners.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.000]   If you haven't used our tools yet, I would love if you use them. If you have used our tools,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.880]   I really appreciate your support and send us even more feedback because it's really the feedback
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.400]   that's made our product good and given us the success that we've had so far.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.120]   We're also looking to grow our team, of course. If you're interested in joining
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.640]   us and making great stuff, please shoot us an email. Thanks.
