[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.200]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.360]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.360]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.520]   Today I want to continue a discussion on tax changes, tax law changes, with a brief overview
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.680]   of the text of the recent House Democrat proposal for tax changes that they would like to see
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.320]   passed in tax law.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.640]   Now when I comment on current events, I'm walking a bit of a tightrope.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.240]   If I comment on current events and current proposals, that is good for content.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.640]   It's good for eyeballs because people are often interested in hearing and seeing what's
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.340]   actually happening.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.120]   The problem is that when you comment at an early stage, it's hard to be certain of what
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.320]   will actually get through the political process.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.700]   In the same way that in yesterday's show where I talked about recent proposals and bills
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.800]   that are submitted to Congress for your bank to automatically send all of your transaction
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.640]   information directly to the IRS, if I comment on tax changes here, it's current, it's newsworthy,
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.920]   it's attractive in terms of attention, but it's highly uncertain.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.000]   I don't know what's actually likely to be passed into law, and I'm personally not close
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.700]   enough to the political process to even have a sense of what's actually feasible at this
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.720]   point in time in the political process in the United States.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.520]   So it's dangerous for me to comment on current proposals at an early stage because it's very
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.680]   uncertain.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.480]   However, if you wait too long, if I wait too long, then there's not really any planning
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.280]   opportunities available.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.820]   And I'll point out in just a moment with some commentary on this current bill how obvious
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.080]   and important that is.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.920]   If you wait for a law to become, or a bill to become law, if you wait for the president's
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.800]   signature, then often you're too late to actually put in place any kind of intelligent planning,
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.700]   and so I didn't serve you in that appropriate way.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:23.320]   So what I want to do to try to tackle this problem is I want to use this current bill
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.480]   as a lesson, and I want to show you a few of the themes that I see in the bill, and
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.000]   then talk about how you can plan for the future without regard to any current particular piece
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.640]   of legislation.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.920]   And this is fulfilling a theme that I've talked about for a long time.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.120]   I've talked, for example, for many years about how I expect there to be changes coming up
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.680]   in things like retirement accounts, and I expect far more changes.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.960]   I don't expect the rules that you and I are governed by today to be consistent with the
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.740]   rules that you and I are governed by 20 years from now, which is why long-range financial
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.660]   planning is in many cases quite difficult and dangerous.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.080]   But I'll talk to you about some of the techniques and tools that I think do work in those scenarios.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.960]   So let's begin with the text of the document.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.360]   I will release a direct link to the text of the document in the show notes, so if you
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.220]   would like to read the text of the bill as it is coming out of the House Ways and Means
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.840]   Committee in the United States Congress, then you can feel free to take a look at that.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.800]   It's 800 and something pages, about 200 and something pages of which are directly applicable
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.500]   to financial and tax rules.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.560]   What I would suggest that you do instead of that is take a look at the quite excellent
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.040]   Jeff Levine, who is on Twitter @CPAPlanner.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.760]   Jeff Levine works with and for Michael Kitsis and the Kitsis team.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.320]   He is a real tax expert who does a phenomenal job of staying current on all of the proposals.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.880]   So I took a look through his tweet storm where he was live tweeting and reading his way through
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.760]   the proposed legislation.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.000]   He should have an article released a little bit later today on Kitsis.com covering some
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   of the details.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.280]   At the time of my recording, I have not yet seen his article.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.600]   So feel free to take a look at that at Kitsis.com if you're interested in a very technical analysis
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.400]   of some of the proposed changes.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.280]   A few highlights for you that I think are the most important things that you should
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.280]   know.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.960]   First of all, it is proposed that tax rates are going to be increased.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.400]   Now there are some areas of disagreement between the President's proposal and what the House
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.920]   Democrats are proposing here.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:05:01.040]   In some cases, the House Democrats are significantly more aggressive than the President's proposal,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.320]   which is in some ways I think to be expected.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.080]   In short, the highest tax rate is proposed to be higher.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.360]   In addition, the highest tax rate under the current proposal is proposed to be kicking
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:24.120]   in at something around $400,000 for an individual, $450,000 for a married couple filing jointly.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.240]   That's kind of a lower number than it was previously proposed to be.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.320]   So basically looking at something like a 40% tax rate plus the surcharges on anything in
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.440]   excess of $400,000 of income, which we'll see.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.920]   Now there's also been proposed changes in the capital gains tax rate.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.280]   President Biden had proposed making the top capital gains tax rate equal to the top ordinary
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.480]   income tax rate of 39.6%.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.560]   The House Democrats' proposal seems to be more modest with a maximum capital gains tax
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.720]   rate of 25%.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.600]   Who knows what will wind up happening.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:09.240]   It does seem hard for me to believe that capital gains tax rates will increase to 40%, but
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:16.760]   I would not be surprised or shocked by really anything at this point in time.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.120]   When other important components to the legislation would be changes to even corporate tax rates
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.800]   discussed as well.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:35.640]   Now most interesting to me are some of the legislative changes that are being suggested
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.440]   relating to IRAs and Roth IRAs.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.080]   Specifically, as was pretty easy to predict when the news came out about Peter Thiel's
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.840]   $5 billion Roth IRA.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.560]   Specifically, Congress seems to be taking aim at large retirement accounts, adding a
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.840]   set of new rules governing large retirement accounts.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.440]   Now this is not a surprise in any way.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:12.920]   I think here we see the effect of the data leaks from the IRS to ProPublica, the journalists
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.800]   who have been writing the series of articles on the wealthy and their taxes in the United
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.120]   States.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.720]   We see here the direct effect by way of reminder.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.120]   There was evidently an IRS whistleblower who leaked, we don't know the extent of it, but
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.800]   who leaked at the very least years and years worth of confidential tax returns on at least
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.820]   hundreds of taxpayers in the United States directly to ProPublica.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:51.440]   And ProPublica has been systematically going through that data and publishing various articles
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.880]   on it.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.840]   They had several general interest articles, but perhaps the most newsworthy one was the
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:05.240]   article they released on Peter Thiel's $5 billion Roth IRA, where he turned, I think
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.280]   it was $1,300 of contributions into $5 billion over the course of a couple of decades.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:17.600]   And because he did that in the context of a Roth IRA, then of course those monies under
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.640]   current tax law are considered to be tax-free.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.200]   Now interestingly, if you have not seen it, I would encourage you to go and in fact I'll
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.120]   link it in the show notes today.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.220]   I would encourage you to go and watch the YouTube video that I released for the Nomad
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:44.660]   Capitalist channel on Thiel's Roth IRA, because I actually, I argued in that particular video
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:50.980]   that with Thiel's $5 billion Roth IRA, he actually has a remarkable planning opportunity
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.500]   wherein he could, by expatriating from the United States and renouncing his US citizenship
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:03.820]   after the age of 59 and a half, he could take his $5 billion and take it offshore completely
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.180]   income tax-free, which would be a remarkable opportunity.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.300]   Now will he do that?
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:15.540]   I doubt it, but in my understanding of the laws surrounding expatriation, Roth IRAs,
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.420]   etc., he does have a really interesting opportunity.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.660]   So I'll link that in the show notes as well.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:28.020]   I would encourage you to go and see how he could potentially use his massive Roth IRA
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:34.180]   combined with offshoring for a tremendous tax planning opportunity.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:40.660]   Now under the current proposals, however, there will be a number of changes that are
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.660]   recommended.
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:47.140]   First of all, Roth conversions will be limited based upon income amount, and there will be
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:54.860]   some new required minimum distribution rules on large retirement accounts.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.180]   So the wealthy will not be able to do Roth conversions.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:04.420]   There'll be limitations on the so-called mega backdoor Roth IRAs, where you use a 401(k)
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:09.260]   and then convert some of the after-tax contributions into a Roth IRA.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:15.580]   Also some additional restrictions are being proposed on the kind of investments that you
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:20.260]   can hold inside of an IRA or Roth IRA.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.740]   There are already restrictions that you can't own businesses in which you have more than
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:29.540]   a 50% interest in, but they're tightening up even the private placement market as to
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.300]   what kinds of businesses you can hold in the accounts.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.640]   So a lot of changes there, and all of them in a higher tax direction.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:46.180]   So you need to be aware of what is coming, and hopefully you've taken advantage of opportunities
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.180]   in the past.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:53.060]   That's the extent of which I wish to comment at the moment on the content of that proposal.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:58.980]   Again, go to Kitsis.com to read Jeff's article, which I'm sure will be published later today,
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.020]   if you're especially if you're a financial advisor and you need the information to share
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.600]   with your clients.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:10.420]   What I want to point out, however, is how do you plan in the face of uncertainty?
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:27.620]   I would present this current proposal to you as evidence of the highly unstable nature
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:33.820]   of US-American tax law and political process.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:40.300]   Right now, what you see in the United States is just a complete and total breakdown of
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.940]   the political process.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.700]   There is no long-term vision that everyone has agreed upon.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.400]   There is no overarching plan.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:12:02.220]   We are in a place of schizophrenic gridlock, basically, where we have this ping-pong ball
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:09.360]   bouncing back and forth between the Democrats and the Republicans, and there's no overarching
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.760]   sense of leadership.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:16.640]   There's no overarching sense of consistency of "here's where we're going as a people.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.520]   This is what we believe in."
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.520]   Basically, you just have this bounce back, bounce back, bounce back and forth.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:28.120]   You see this, "Okay, President Obama is going to raise taxes a little bit.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.200]   President Trump is going to lower taxes a little bit.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.760]   President Biden, we're going to raise taxes."
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.480]   Just this back and forth, back and forth.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:45.760]   Now, although you have this schizophrenic gridlock, the actual marginal changes are
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.840]   actually not that big.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.600]   For all of the news that I've just described to you, there's not all that much of a difference
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.600]   to you.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.160]   It makes a little bit of a difference if you go from a 37% tax rate to highest marginal
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.400]   bracket to a 39.6% marginal tax bracket.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.360]   At the end of the day, that's not that big of a difference.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.680]   It makes a little bit of a difference if the top rate kicks in at $500,000 or $400,000,
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.400]   but at the end of the day, these are only marginal differences and things kind of march
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.840]   on business as usual.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:26.880]   The IRAs and the Roth IRA proposals are interesting to note, but they're not that big of a deal.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.280]   Meaning that, okay, some people do backdoor Roth IRAs and mega backdoor Roth IRAs, but
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.200]   they're not super popular.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:39.560]   They're popular in the hardcore financial nerd space, but broadly speaking, they're not particularly
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.360]   popular.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.800]   They're trying to tighten something up.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.360]   Okay, some people are going to pass a new law with additional requirement of distribution
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.640]   rules if you have a really big account and a high income, but fine, that's kind of expected.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.760]   There's this argument back and forth, but things do more or less kind of just march
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.960]   on.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.640]   I find it difficult to know how to analyze this because on the one hand, I could create
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.360]   a show saying, "Look how schizophrenic this is and just the whole system is broken," but
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.640]   then on the other hand, I could create a show and say, "Look, things kind of continue as
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   normal."
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:22.800]   I have argued that, hey, since 1950s, tax collection is locked right out at about 25%
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   of GDP.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:29.360]   So, while there's a little change on the margins, I think that from my perspective, it seems
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.720]   like the politicians in the United States have pretty well feel like they have figured
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.520]   out their Laffer curve, meaning that they've figured out the optimal level of taxation
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:45.000]   where people will pay as much as they can possibly pay without rebelling.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.480]   You don't see much rebellion.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.800]   Very few people, although some people are, very few people are leaving high income tax
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   states.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.360]   Some people are, but not really.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.760]   There's millions and millions and millions of people who are quite happily living in
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.520]   California and New York.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.640]   There are a few people who are fleeing for different places, but there are some businesses
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.200]   moving but not much.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.480]   There are people fleeing the United States, a few people are, but all things considered,
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.560]   not many.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.000]   And so, it seems like the politicians have pretty well dialed in their Laffer curve,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.520]   which they've figured out the optimal amount of tax collection and things kind of continue
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.880]   as normal.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.800]   And so, I don't know which of those arguments to make.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.640]   I think that, although it's paradoxical, both of them are true.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:41.080]   I think that the current schizophrenic arguments and bickering simply serve the politicians
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.520]   because they are able to go to their side and say, "Look, I'm fighting for us."
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.800]   While the changes aren't actually that significant, so people just kind of go along.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.000]   And I know that sounds cynical.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.140]   I try to guard against cynicism, but it's hard to observe the process and come away
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.360]   with anything but.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:07.920]   As far as I can tell, Congress in the United States is broken.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.120]   There's no major legislation happening.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.120]   They've abdicated much of their responsibility for legislation to the courts on important
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.240]   issues and it seems pretty well broken.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.040]   So, time will tell.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   We'll see.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.560]   So, what can you do?
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:29.720]   The first lesson I would say is you should always do your planning earlier rather than
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.900]   later.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:36.280]   One of the things that I think was the most interesting about this particular proposal
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.960]   is the dates that were assigned from it.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.840]   When President Biden was elected, there were a lot of people who were saying, "Okay,
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:51.320]   I need to sell something because I don't want to pay a higher capital gains tax right down
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   the road."
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.160]   But, none of us knew what the date was.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:02.660]   Some people argued that the tax changes would be imposed retroactively.
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.260]   California did that a number of years ago.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.660]   They passed a tax law and then they made it retroactive.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:13.060]   So, the law was passed, for example, on September 1st, but they made it apply all the way back
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.780]   through January 1st.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.500]   I don't remember the exact dates.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.620]   That's what a retroactive tax law is.
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.780]   So, California voters went along with it.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.340]   They weren't bothered by it.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.540]   That's pretty wrong and evil in my opinion, but they did that.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.660]   Some people argued, "Well, it would be a future date."
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:33.380]   But this particular proposal puts the dates down and it was the date that the proposal
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.300]   was released publicly, which was September 13th.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:43.460]   And so, here I am recording this on September 15th of 2021 and it's too late, right?
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.760]   Unless you had a binding contract in place as of September 13th and nothing materially
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:54.620]   changes with that, any kind of sales that you do now are exposed to the higher rate.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.860]   And so, the lesson here is if you think that you see the future, right?
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.940]   If you think that taxes are going to go up, you have to follow through with your convictions
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.460]   and your analysis, even if there's not evidence that you can point to.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.340]   Because when they release that date, it's too late, right?
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.380]   When they make that happen, it's done.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.300]   And so, if you saw that, "Hey, we have a new president, we have a democratic house,
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:25.340]   democratic senate, taxes are going to go up," you needed the conviction to actually follow
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:30.980]   through and make your sales to the extent that you were going to sell things in the
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.940]   previous cycle.
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.460]   Because once it was released, we now see September 13th was the date.
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.460]   That was the date.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.200]   So, the first thing is follow your convictions.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.180]   If you believe that taxes are going up and you should do Roth conversions, follow your
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.180]   convictions.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.360]   If you believe taxes are going up and you should sell assets while they're at a lower
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.320]   amount, follow your convictions.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.700]   Because at this point in time, the prognostication business is quite difficult, so you have to
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.740]   look at the general trend.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:07.600]   The second lesson that I draw from this is we can clearly see there is a legislative
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:14.160]   implementation of the general trend, meaning it was not hard to predict that taxes are
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.140]   going to go up, and here we see the teeth coming out for that actual proposal.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.480]   What will happen politically?
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.180]   I don't know.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:29.400]   I don't know what happens in a reconciliation process, but we see here the evidence that
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.960]   elections have consequences, and if you are living and working in the United States, taxes
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.280]   will go up.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.560]   And so, pay attention to the trends.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.600]   Pay attention to what is happening.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:51.320]   The third thing that I observe is that the government changes the rules, and I want you
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:58.040]   to pay attention to the fact that they are significantly changing here the rules on IRAs,
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:03.840]   Roth IRAs, and things like conversions.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:11.600]   I thought when I was a young man, I thought that, "Hey, law is a law, and it should continue."
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:18.760]   And that's because I equated moral laws with current laws.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.160]   And so I thought, "Well, laws shouldn't change.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.580]   If it's illegal to kill somebody or to murder somebody, it should be illegal to murder somebody
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.580]   no matter who's president.
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.320]   It should be illegal to murder someone no matter what political party is in power."
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.600]   And so I thought there was a lot of stability, and I used to listen to people when I was
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.360]   younger who would say, "Oh, the laws will change.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.600]   Don't trust Roth IRAs, or don't trust IRAs because the laws will change on them."
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.560]   And I thought, "No, they can't change.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.560]   It's a law.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   They said it."
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:52.800]   Well, I have learned over the years that it wasn't wacky to say that things would change.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.840]   You have to look and read the direction, say what's happening.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.760]   And people are using things, they will change.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   And so I've come to be convinced at the current moment, I've come to be persuaded that many
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.120]   of these laws will change.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:15.000]   And all of the laws on things like IRAs, 401ks, Roth IRAs, et cetera, will change.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.800]   Congress keeps a list of what is called tax expenditures, and on that list is 401k tax
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.240]   exemptions, Roth IRA tax exemptions.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:31.120]   And as is so often the case, when Congress passes a law, they call it an incentive, and
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.160]   then when you follow the law that they pass, they call it a loophole.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.200]   And so you're dealing here with people who will change the laws.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:43.520]   And as the financial situation in the United States becomes more and more dire over the
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.040]   coming years and decades, you will see many of these laws change.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.920]   And I think that the way that you will see them change is the way that you see them changing
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.200]   right now.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:04.440]   Nobody today is going to cry over the prospect of Peter Thiel or Mitt Romney or some other
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:09.120]   rich fat cat who's got $500 million in his IRA.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.800]   Nobody is going to cry over that guy paying higher taxes or him being subjected to additional
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.840]   required minimum distributions, which forces money out in taxes.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.500]   No one's going to cry over it.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:26.260]   But what that does is that psychologically primes the population to accept that their
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.940]   taxes will change as well, and that their IRAs will be taxed, and their Roth IRAs will
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.960]   be taxed, etc.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   And so I think that you should assume that everything is going to change.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.840]   I do not assume that my Roth IRA will remain tax-free.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.080]   I look at it and I say, at the moment they're saying that my distributions from my Roth
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.560]   IRA will be tax-free, but that'll change.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.360]   At the moment they're saying that I can maintain the tax deferral on my 401(k) subject to the
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.200]   current rules at age 70 and a half when I get required minimum distributions, but that
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.200]   will change.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.200]   What will change?
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   Well, I don't know.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.840]   They can change the RMD formula.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.960]   They can make the money come out at an earlier amount.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.760]   But these things are not set in stone.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.520]   They're just the current round.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.640]   And they can pass if there's a political consensus, and they can just simply pass a new set of
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.640]   rules.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.920]   Congress gave us the Roth IRA.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.800]   Congress can take away the Roth IRA.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.720]   Congress has power and authority to do whatever they want with these rules, and we're subject
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.440]   to them.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:34.240]   So the first lesson that I use this as evidence is, don't place any kind of long-term trust
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.000]   or confidence into the promises of these government agents.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.560]   Don't trust them.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.320]   Recognize that they will change the law when it is politically expedient for them to change
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.800]   the law.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:53.680]   And they will use whatever tools and means necessary, including leaking personal data
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:59.080]   from the IRS to a journalist article to change the perception of people so that everyone's
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.440]   looking down and saying, "Peter Thiel has a $5 billion Roth IRA.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.840]   That's not appropriate, and so we should change the law."
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.440]   And then you and I might very well be swept up in that law change.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.860]   It's political warfare.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.640]   It's propaganda warfare.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.280]   And so expect it to happen.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:20.720]   Do I have any evidence or proof that the leak was manipulated, the leak was intentional
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.600]   by political actors?
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.200]   I have no evidence or proof whatsoever.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:32.480]   But if you think back, right, for the last few months, leak all the data, all of the
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:41.000]   confidential tax records of the wealthiest people in the United States, leak it all after
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.280]   the election of a Democratic president, after the election of a Democratic Congress, leak
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.160]   it to a journalistic outfit.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.760]   Journalistic outfit starts publishing the stories.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.980]   The stories make their way into the news cycle.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.120]   And here at perfect timing, here is the change.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:00.080]   Now are the politicians responding to what the muckraking journalists discovered?
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   Or is there something more, is there greater collusion?
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   I don't know, but the end effect is the same.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.280]   And I have not yet heard of anybody being prosecuted or any major investigations into
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.960]   who leaked that confidential tax information.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.440]   The end result is the same.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.880]   The end result is now we have legislation proposed, which changes new rules, and we're
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.240]   going to have widespread support for taxing the rich.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.080]   So the means don't matter.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.200]   What matters is the end result.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:38.280]   Now the next lesson that I would draw from this though is while rules can change, you're
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:43.400]   kind of stuck with using the rules as they are for yourself.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.680]   I'm not opposed to making contributions to 401ks, Roth IRAs, etc.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:55.960]   I see that as it's really the only tool that a US citizen has, or a US employee, somebody,
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.820]   a US person who is an employee has to lower his tax rates.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:04.880]   And they work well, and there are many good reasons to use them even if the laws change.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:11.120]   I'm a major proponent of 401k accounts, especially due to their asset protection benefits.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:19.240]   And so you can know simultaneously that the rules will change, but still look and make
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.240]   a good solid decision saying I'm going to use this account because it serves my interests
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.720]   right now.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.520]   And that's the way that I think you should look at things, is not look at things and
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:35.080]   be swept up in this fury of "hey, they're going to change the laws and so I can't trust
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.080]   them."
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.240]   But just simply look at it and say as things exist right now, what serves my interests?
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.680]   I've made contributions to retirement accounts.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.920]   I've taken early withdrawals from retirement accounts that I've talked about on Radical
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.200]   Personal Finance.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.160]   If you have periods in which your income is going to go down, then it's better for you
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:59.280]   to make contributions to tax-deferred accounts when your income is high, even if a year later
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.740]   when your income is low, you take the money out and pay a penalty.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.360]   And so these accounts are not sacrosanct.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.720]   You just look at them and say, "What can I do now?
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.520]   What's the best solution for me right now?"
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.880]   And so I encourage the use of the accounts if they fit your situation.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:20.440]   I encourage people to use Roth IRAs as a place to put their emergency funds.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.080]   It's not worrying and banking on the tax laws of 40 years from now.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.360]   I'm encouraging you to focus on today, on the benefits today, and then we'll see what
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.120]   the tax laws are 40 years from now.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.760]   Good financial planning should allow a lot of flexibility.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.040]   Don't do something if the only reason for doing it is what you're going to get 40 years
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.640]   from now, because that's too uncertain.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.640]   There's no way for you or me to predict what things will be like 40 years from now.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.080]   I believe the system will be completely transformed.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:57.480]   But do something based upon what serves your interests now, and then be prepared to respond
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:03.040]   and to adapt as the legislation changes over time.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:12.560]   So go based upon your personal situation, observe what's right in your situation at
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:18.480]   the moment, and then make whatever changes are necessary along the way to adapt as the
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.240]   laws change.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.620]   You don't have to be an extremist on the issue.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.600]   You don't have to say, "Nobody should participate in a Roth IRA because they're going to change
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   the laws."
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.640]   Neither do you have to say that everyone should put in a Roth IRA and you're a wacky conspiracy
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.080]   theorist if you think that the laws will change.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:41.520]   To me, neither of those extremist positions seem to be the appropriate way to handle reality.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.640]   My opinion, as what seems to me to be the most appropriate way to handle this reality,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.840]   is look at the rules, understand what they are now, take the measure of the wind as far
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.560]   as the winds of political change, the winds of what's going to happen in the future in
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:05.800]   terms of tax collection, tax rates, etc., and then do what seems best at the moment,
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:11.920]   but keep your plans flexible, knowing that you may have to change them and adjust them.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:17.020]   Here are my personal predictions, my current finger in the wind as I dope the wind and
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.080]   try to tell you here's what I think is going to happen.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:30.240]   Number one, over the significant arch, the US government has a major fiscal imbalance.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.640]   Expenses are much higher than revenues, and so the US government needs revenues.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:41.880]   There are four sources of revenue that the US government has.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.920]   Or, any government has.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.760]   Number one is tax collection, number two is borrowing, number three is user fees, and
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.840]   number four is inflation.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:57.760]   So taxes have to be increased in order for some combination of those four has to happen.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.160]   So let's talk about it.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   What's likely?
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:06.240]   I think what's likely is all the major three will all be used, maybe user fees as well.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.400]   User fees is just insignificant, so I'm going to leave it off for now.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:16.120]   Number one, taxes will go up, but I think that there is a cultural restraint against
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.280]   massive tax increases.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:26.720]   I don't think that the US highest marginal tax bracket is going to go from 39.6% to a
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.400]   Swedish 65%.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.560]   It's not going to happen.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.720]   It's not culturally the same.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.480]   The US Americans won't accept that.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:41.660]   So there will be some changes at the margin, it may go from 39.6% to 41% or 41% to 43%,
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:47.240]   but we're not going back to 90% marginal tax brackets like the United States had several
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   decades ago.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.640]   That's not going to happen, in my opinion.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:56.360]   And so tax collection will increase, taxes will increase, but a little bit.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.840]   Rates will go up a little bit, brackets will adjust, the tax collection will go up.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:05.440]   I think the major tools that the US government is going to depend upon are borrowing and
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.440]   inflation.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.240]   Those are the two major tools for increasing revenue.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.320]   And so I think we'll see lots more borrowing and lots more inflation until or unless borrowing
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.360]   doesn't work anymore and/or inflation doesn't work anymore.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.260]   And then I think we'll see significant levels of default.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.600]   That's my opinion.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.760]   But that's over a course of several decades.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.000]   And so there's not going to be any kind of major change right now.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.680]   That's going to be a course of several decades.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.440]   The next lesson that I think you should take from this is you should focus on doing what's
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:46.920]   right for you without regard... and focus on the things that you can control.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:53.600]   For example, the people who win or who have won are not the people who've just piled up
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:58.040]   more money in their IRAs, but rather the people who've taken control of their businesses,
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.520]   taken control of their incomes, etc.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:05.500]   And so I spend much more time focusing on income and business because that makes a bigger
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:10.040]   difference than what the tax rate is in your IRA, your Roth IRA.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.520]   Not everyone is right for entrepreneurship.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.560]   Totally concede that first up.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.960]   But if you're right for entrepreneurship or if you're right for improving your career
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.240]   scale, that's going to make a bigger difference for you from a financial planning perspective
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.000]   than worrying about tax rates.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Always focused.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.340]   Keep the main thing the main thing.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.360]   Always focused on those things that have the bigger impact.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.780]   Do your 2080 analysis relentlessly.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.480]   Practice that analysis relentlessly and don't worry too much about short-term tax rates.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.280]   Focus more on the things that are going to make the biggest difference.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:51.640]   The next lesson I would point out to you is those who can afford to wait always have the
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.320]   most options.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:33:01.280]   The key to good long-term planning is as much as possible have the ability to sit and wait.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.280]   Think multi-decades.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.480]   Think multi-generationally.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.480]   Not just short-term.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:13.440]   A difference between 37 and 39% is not that big of a deal.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.020]   What you need to do is you need to have enough assets that you're sitting on that you're
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.940]   not going to sell for many many years.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:24.020]   One thing that was nice is that to my knowledge, I believe I got this right, is that in the
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:34.400]   current Democratic House tax proposal they didn't mess around with imposing problems
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.100]   on the step-up basis for the transfer of capital gains assets at death.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:46.960]   And so this is a disparity between what the president's proposal was and what the current
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.660]   Democratic proposal is.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.220]   And so the key is have assets that you can borrow against when you need to.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:58.440]   Have assets that you can just sit and wait and take a very long-term time perspective.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.360]   Don't think in terms of three years.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.640]   Think in terms of 30 years whenever you have the opportunity.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:10.440]   I guess the final lesson I would say is I do believe that competition is going to become
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.400]   more relevant in the coming years.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:19.060]   I have worked very hard over the last three years to put in place a comprehensive internationalization
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:23.360]   plan for myself and for my children.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.800]   And three years ago I had nothing.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.740]   I had no internationalization plan.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:37.340]   Today I have a very robust and resilient and diverse internationalization plan.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:43.260]   And it took me three years of work to do but it feels worth it.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:48.480]   And one of my major compelling reasons, I had several major compelling reasons, but
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:57.420]   one of them was looking at this schizophrenia in the political space and just thinking like
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.000]   "wouldn't it be nice to be out of this?
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.060]   Why should I have my life and my children's lives governed by this?"
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:11.620]   And I determined, I said "I'm not going to have a significant portion of my life governed
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.620]   by this schizophrenia.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.700]   I'm not going to do it."
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:21.540]   And so I said "I don't want my children's futures to be tied to the future of the United
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.540]   States."
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:31.340]   And while I'm not as dark in terms of my outlook as a lot of people are, I'm a bit more relaxed
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.500]   in terms of I don't predict worst-case scenarios.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.060]   I decided that it was too big of a risk for me to leave alone and so I started doing what
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.060]   I've done over the last three years.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:46.860]   Well having completed phase one of my kind of long-term internationalization plans, putting
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:53.460]   myself in a situation where my life and my children's life is no longer attached to the
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:58.420]   future of the United States, where I can divorce myself from that country, I can divorce my
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:03.260]   children from that country, they have to wait until they're 18 to do it themselves.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.620]   But I've put in place all the infrastructure that they need.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.660]   Then it does make me feel a lot more peaceful.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:14.500]   And so it just feels like a really good insurance policy to where I look at it and I say "Okay,
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.580]   if I'm wrong and taxes do change dramatically, I don't have to stick around.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.380]   I don't have to stay forever."
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.180]   And I would encourage you to do that as well.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:28.620]   Is recognize that if this stuff bothers you and annoys you, you don't have to stick it
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.620]   out, right?
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.460]   You don't have to stay and be abused by it.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.500]   I think there's a good reason why most people will stay.
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.620]   I'm traveling back to the United States this next week.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.420]   I might stay for a time.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:44.380]   I really love so many things about the United States.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.460]   But you'll feel better if you just put yourself in a situation where you're not stuck with
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.580]   it, and that may give you more peace.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.440]   And so I'd encourage you to do that.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.020]   You have to do it long in advance, right?
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.580]   You have to do it before you need it.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.700]   Don't wait for the last minute.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.540]   The internationalization stuff takes a long time.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.340]   It's always longer than you wish, but you can do it.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:10.580]   So put the pieces in place today that you would need in the future if you didn't want
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.900]   to actually be governed by these guys, if you didn't want to actually deal with their
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.420]   long-term schizophrenia.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:22.180]   Put in place the pieces that you would need to be able to have more options, and I think
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.500]   you'll feel better as well.
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.980]   I have really appreciated that.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.540]   I try to be thoughtful and share with you that it's not for everyone.
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.700]   I've tried very hard to share with you the difficulties.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.060]   I'm very aware of the difficulties.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:39.140]   I appreciate so many things that are easier and better in the United States.
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:45.780]   But I'll tell you, watching the political process, watching this tax stuff change, watching
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:54.140]   the arguments and the fights and the debates makes me much, much—I'm much more even-keeled
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:38:00.780]   and relaxed and less stressed out about it now that I know that I'm no longer a slave.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:05.580]   I know that I'm no longer beholden to them.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.140]   And so that makes me feel better.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.700]   And I want you to have that feeling as well if that's of interest to you.
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.340]   Hopefully these are some useful lessons for you.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.900]   Don't put too much stock in this current proposal.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.660]   Recognize that taxes may go up, and hey, this might be a time where you just simply grow
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.220]   your wealth rather than your income.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.660]   And then when taxes go down in the next round of political things, then that's a time that
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.000]   you take more income.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.180]   If you will build your reserves, you'll always have that option.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.360]   So focus on building reserves.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.940]   Build income streams that don't force you to take income.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.500]   To do that, you'll need to be in an ownership position of a company and/or negotiate better
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.660]   deferred compensation arrangements.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:47.460]   So remember that there are only three basic tax strategies—going back to what, episode
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.220]   four or something of Radical Personal Finance, right?
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.900]   There are only income shifting strategies, income timing strategies, and income conversion
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.900]   strategies.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.980]   And all three of these still apply.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:02.960]   But get control of the timing of your income so that you can stretch it out and defer it
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.280]   to times when taxes are lower.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:11.640]   Get control of the ways that your income—so you can convert highly taxed income into less
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.600]   taxed income.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.520]   And then work on shifting strategies.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:21.840]   How can you shift income from high taxpayers to low taxpayers?
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:27.380]   If you will get into a place of control, then you don't need to worry too much about the
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.380]   current proposals.
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.900]   That's it for today's show.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.900]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.440]   I would remind you that I have started taking private consulting clients.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.860]   So if you'd like to consult with me on tax planning or internationalization planning,
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:45.220]   if you'd like a balanced expert eye to tell you—kind of cut through a lot of the noise
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.400]   and point you in a direction to some things that work quickly, been there, done that can
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.520]   consult with you on either of those topics.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:57.020]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult, and book
