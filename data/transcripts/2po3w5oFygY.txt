[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   [silence]
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.920]   So let's think about dopamine peaks and baselines.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.760]   And let's remember that for every peak, there's a trough.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.600]   What do I mean by that?
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.600]   Well, when you have a wave,
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.720]   you also have the bottom of the wave.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.840]   When you have a mountain, you have the bottom of the mountain.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.840]   When we think about dopamine peaks and dopamine baselines,
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.560]   we have to include that trough because that trough,
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.320]   that is the level of dopamine below baseline,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.040]   really dictates whether or not you are going to feel
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.460]   motivated to pursue something or not.
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.200]   So I'm going to give you a visual in your mind.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.620]   The visual in your mind is an increase in dopamine
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.060]   that's triggered by your desire for something.
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.040]   And really it could be your desire for anything.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.960]   If you're hungry and you're thinking about,
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.520]   I really want a sandwich.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.880]   I really want a, let's think,
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.120]   what sandwich would I want right now?
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.640]   A really nice roast beef sandwich on sourdough
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.400]   with a slice of Swiss, tomatoes, slice of pickle.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.460]   Here I'm describing the sandwich that I would want.
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.160]   So if you're hungry and you're thinking about that,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.480]   dopamine starts rising.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.640]   This is crucially important to understand.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.180]   Dopamine is not just released when we get the reward,
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.680]   when we get the thing that we're pursuing.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.300]   Dopamine is released in anticipation of what we want.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.960]   That increase in dopamine is by no happenstance,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.040]   no mistake, relates also to our propensity
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.320]   and desire to move.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.260]   Remember earlier I told you there's a separate circuit
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.040]   of dopamine that triggers movement
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.180]   and that when it's depleted is causing things
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.520]   like deficits in movement related to Parkinson's
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.000]   or other movement disorders.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.520]   Well, that's not pure coincidence.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.320]   That's because desire and the need to move
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.600]   in order to pursue and reach goals
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.280]   are one in the same process.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.000]   So if I desire a sandwich or I desire a cup of coffee
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.080]   or I desire some water when I'm thirsty,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.680]   there's an increase in dopamine
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.800]   that we could call a little mini peak in dopamine.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.520]   But then here's the key thing.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.420]   Very soon after I realized my desire for something,
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.640]   that peak that was caused by the desire
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.800]   comes down and drops below baseline,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.960]   below the level of dopamine that it was prior
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.000]   to even thinking about the sandwich or the coffee
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.200]   or the glass of water.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.680]   And it's that drop below baseline
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.800]   that triggers my desire to go out and find that sandwich,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.840]   that coffee, that water, or that blank,
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.000]   insert whatever it is that you happen to desire,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.240]   action or substance of any kind or person, et cetera.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.360]   So that drop below baseline is fundamental
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.280]   to the whole process.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.800]   And that drop below baseline was triggered
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.440]   by the preceding peak.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.240]   So let's say that I desire a sandwich,
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.800]   there's an increase in dopamine.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.600]   Then very quickly, it comes down below baseline
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.680]   just a little bit.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.880]   Now I'm in pursuit of the sandwich.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.960]   I'm looking for where I can get that sandwich.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.880]   I can order it, perhaps to be delivered.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.120]   I can go out and find it.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.760]   Now is the stage in which I have to think about
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.000]   what are the different stimuli,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.440]   that is the things in my environment
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.100]   that signal whether or not I'm likely
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.920]   to get that sandwich or not.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.000]   And so for instance, if I were to go into my phone
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.600]   and order food on an app or walk down the street
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.040]   and see the sign for a deli,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   that's a cue that I'm likely to relieve that drop
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.080]   in dopamine and get not just back to baseline,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.840]   but that I'll get a peak in dopamine.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.080]   And indeed that's what happens.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.440]   If I find that deli, I go into the deli,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.360]   they're open, they're making the sandwich that I want,
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.000]   they make my sandwich and great, I get that sandwich.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.620]   And that sandwich will have some degree
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.120]   of inherent reward to it.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.400]   Some degree of my liking it or not liking it.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   So let's say I like it.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.840]   It's not the best sandwich I've ever had,
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.520]   but all I'm doing is comparing my desire for that sandwich
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.080]   to the sandwich that I actually got and ate.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.600]   And chances are, it's going to relieve that craving,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   meaning it will take that dopamine
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.760]   that had fallen below baseline, up, up, back to baseline.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.200]   And if I like the sandwich,
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.060]   it's going to indeed increase that dopamine,
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.480]   again, to another peak.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.160]   Now, if I love the sandwich,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.480]   like it's the most delicious thing
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.340]   that I've ever tasted in my entire life,
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.340]   well then I'll get a big peak in dopamine
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.560]   when I consume that reward.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.160]   However, chances are the sandwich is more or less
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.280]   as I expect it to be, which is pretty good.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.760]   I'll eat it and I'm fine.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.960]   What do I mean by fine?
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.400]   Well, there's a concept called reward prediction error.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.080]   Reward prediction error says that the dopamine
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.920]   that it has experienced, that is,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.660]   that's released from the VTA and nucleus accumbens,
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.980]   is going to be of a certain value.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.120]   And that value is going to be compared
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.860]   to the desire and expectation
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.940]   of what I thought I was going to get.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.640]   So if you take what you actually got
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.960]   minus what you expected, that's reward prediction error.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.600]   So if the sandwich is basically what I expected to get,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.160]   fine, dopamine comes down basically to a baseline level
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.240]   that's pretty standard for me
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.040]   and is basically the baseline level I had
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.840]   before I ever thought about the sandwich at all.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.980]   If the sandwich completely surprises me
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.280]   and is completely amazing, just an amazing sandwich,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.040]   well then, the level of dopamine that I experience
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.320]   when I consume that sandwich is going to be even greater
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.720]   and it's going to be that minus what I expected.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.520]   So there, it's a bigger reward prediction error
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.140]   in the direction of higher peak by consuming the sandwich.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.960]   And then of course, there's the other possibility,
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.360]   which is the deli's closed
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.160]   or the sandwich they make me is lousy
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.240]   or it doesn't taste good or something happened
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.800]   in the consuming of that sandwich
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.900]   that just makes it a bad experience.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.600]   In which case, if we take that reward experienced
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.520]   minus reward predicted from the initial craving,
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.080]   well then it's going to be less than what I expected
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.920]   and therefore the baseline drops below
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.680]   where it was prior to even desiring the sandwich.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.720]   Okay, so all of this might seem a little bit complicated,
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.160]   but it's all very simple.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.720]   Desire for things increases dopamine,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.760]   but then our level of dopamine drops below baseline
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.800]   and it's that drop below baseline
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.520]   that triggers the motivation
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.200]   to bring that dopamine level back up
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   by going and pursuing the thing
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.880]   that you wanted in the first place.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.840]   Now, of course, as this is happening,
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.840]   you're not conscious of your dopamine levels.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.160]   You experience this as context-dependent craving and pursuit.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.540]   Because remember, the prefrontal cortex
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.200]   is involved in context setting and craving and pursuit
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.620]   because it relates to action and movement,
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.200]   which is one of the general features of the dopamine system.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.080]   So you can start to see
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.200]   how this is a beautifully designed system.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.140]   And you can also see how it's a perfect system
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.700]   for desire and pursuit of anything, not just sandwiches,
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.600]   as I'm giving you in this somewhat trivial,
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.260]   but everyday and therefore applicable example.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.840]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.240]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.100]   (upbeat music)
