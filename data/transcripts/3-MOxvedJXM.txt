[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   All right, so I want to go return to a segment we introduced a couple weeks ago, the habit
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.780]   tune up segment.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.960]   The idea here is that I just take a piece of advice from the large toolbox of tips and
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.280]   tricks and rules I've written about or talked about over the years and just focus on it
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.020]   a little bit.
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.080]   And so in particular, today, I want to talk about what I think is the most important piece
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.760]   of productivity software that's out there.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.040]   And I'll give you a hint, you all already have it on all of your devices.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.660]   That's the good news.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.800]   And that is my strategy of using a working memory dot txt, plain text file.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.080]   So I have a couple different names for this.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.160]   A working memory dot txt is one name for this.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.100]   The other is what I call text file or plain text file productivity.
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.640]   Over the years, I've used both of those terms.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.040]   But the basic idea is quite simple.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.940]   You have on the computers you use a blank text file, and you keep it open.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.240]   And it's always open on your desktop.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.140]   I call mine working memory dot txt.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.120]   I'm just using the text editor on my Mac.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.280]   I don't even have rich formatting turned on.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.280]   It's plain text.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.920]   There's no bolding, there's no font size, it's just plain text, and you just have it
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.120]   open.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.880]   And it is literally a way to offload things out of your brain, where you can still see
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.200]   them, look at them, organize and make sense of them, without having to keep all these
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.760]   things in your mind at the same time.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.200]   And what this is recognizing, the reality this is recognizing is that we have very limited
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   working memory.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.540]   So we can only keep so much in our head at a time.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.360]   And as I talk about all the time on this show, there's a real cost of cognitive context switching.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.320]   So if you're trying to keep track of multiple different things at the same time, it's very
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.880]   difficult to sort of go back and forth between them, to see how they trade off, to see how
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.200]   you're going to make these things work, because your mind is trying to switch back and forth
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.800]   between all these contexts.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.920]   If you offload things to a text file, you can just see them.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.820]   It is a huge cybernetic boost to your organizational capacity.
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.120]   So now you can have lots of things written down, you can see them without having to hold
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.080]   them in your head, you can focus on one thing at a time at your head.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.640]   You can also juggle a bunch of things and see their connections, because when you're
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.560]   looking down them all written down and not trying to hold them all in your head, you're
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.600]   not paying nearly as big as a context shifting cost.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.160]   It's a huge secret to my success.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.840]   So there's a couple ways you might use this.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.640]   One would be you're trying to solve a complicated problem.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.880]   You know, okay, how are we going to get we have this visitor coming?
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.240]   How are we going to get the travel logistics?
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.240]   What do we need to do?
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.800]   Man, this seems so complicated.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   Like how are they?
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   Are they going to come?
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   Are they going to need a hotel?
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   How are they going to stay?
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.880]   So like you have a problem that's complicated, it has a lot of moving parts.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.640]   You're not going to solve this in your head, you start typing everything out.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.760]   Like what are all the different things that need to happen?
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.940]   You refine it and you combine it.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.320]   You can start doing visual lexicographic thinking.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.880]   Like, well, let me grab these three lines, copy and paste and put them down here and
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.800]   label them with, all right, this I can all offload to, you know, Jesse to do this I don't
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.720]   know about this, I'm going to move to Thursday, you can start labeling these things and categorizing
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720]   them.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.520]   So there's a very complex organization and thinking here that you would not be able to
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.280]   do very well just in your head.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.040]   The text file helps.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.720]   Another scenario where the plain text file is going to really help you is let's say as
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.040]   you're trying to get through your email, trying to clear out all this email that's built up,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   I have 50 messages and they're all different.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.080]   They're dealing with different issues, all different cognitive contexts.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.680]   Trying to deal with each of those one by one as so many of us have learned can be devastating
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.320]   because you're switching context again and again, email to email and you burn out like
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.000]   I can't do this anymore and you start hunting for easy to reply to messages because your
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.960]   brain is tired.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.680]   The alternative is using your plain text files, you start actually like capturing what's in
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.240]   these emails, what their request is, what you need to do in your text file.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.200]   Just give each of them a different line.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.360]   Now you have 20 or 30 different lines on here.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.200]   You haven't had to solve any of these issues that you've just summarized all the emails
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.160]   with one or two lines on this big text file.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.680]   Now you can start grouping, now you can start organizing, now you can start pulling everything
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.600]   related to one project, copy and pasting and put them next to each other and everything
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.980]   related to this project over here and things you have no idea how to answer over here.
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.800]   You're making sense of the information without having to dive into it, without having to
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.000]   try to keep track of all this stuff in your head.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.560]   And then you go through and you answer all these emails at once, then switch through
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.720]   and put a calendar notice for answering these somewhere else.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.160]   It is really like a organizational superpower once you get really good at using this plain
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.080]   text file to extend and organize what's on your plate.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.880]   It's like taking your brain and making it a much better brain.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.480]   And it's something I swear by, I keep the file open all the time.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   Stuff is just on there.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.160]   If I just have a random thought, I'll just write it on there.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.840]   And you know, by the end of the day, I try to look at that.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.080]   Is there anything on here that needs to go back into a system?
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.800]   Was there a thought I dropped that I haven't handled?
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.240]   And I'll I'll look through and kind of process that working memory that TXT at the end of
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.560]   the day to see what's left on there.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.680]   But it's always there.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.920]   And it's storing all sorts of information and being used for all sorts of different
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.000]   purposes.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.820]   And I cannot overemphasize once you get good at this simple but powerful productivity hack,
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.540]   how much extra capability that it gives you.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.520]   How much extra capability gives you so stop trying to do all this stuff in your head.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.240]   Use a simple text file.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.440]   Can I ask a couple of follow up questions?
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.440]   When did you start this?
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.240]   It's a good question.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.480]   So there if you search, I wrote about it on my blog.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.040]   Back in my MIT days.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.440]   Look for if you want to do a Google search, I don't know if you have that up there.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.080]   Work like me is plain text productivity, working memory dot txt.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.920]   I don't know, but it would have been the original post on this would have been 2008.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.980]   If I had to guess 2007 maybe a little bit later.
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.080]   Plain text productivity is what I used to call this I think or freestyle productivity.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.560]   Yeah, I also used to call it freestyle productivity.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.200]   So like forget, I don't care how you structure this or format this just like get stuff on
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:29.160]   the file and start rock and rolling with there's a plain text dash productivity dot net URL.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.200]   I take full credit.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:37.360]   I say before you go to the website and realize it's actually about like kidnapping children
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   or something.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.520]   So you're doing this in college or was it after college?
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.640]   After college, but definitely or pretty early in grad school.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.480]   And then do you remember how you discovered it?
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   That's a good question.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.480]   2009 freestyle productivity.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.240]   2009 there we go.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.060]   Probably because there's a whole culture of this in computer science and developers.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.800]   So developers, so people who write computer code.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.200]   So I was exposed to this obviously as a computer science graduate student at MIT.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.440]   They are really big on using these text editors like Vim or Emacs because that's where they
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.020]   would write their code and they customize it and they got really big on using these
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.280]   for all parts of their life.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.440]   And probably I came across the original.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.040]   So I'm really just a deep hole.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.360]   I think Danny, I'm gonna get this name wrong.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:35.580]   Danny Lewin maybe gave this famous talk where he introduced the idea of life hackers.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.820]   It's like life hacking as a notion was introduced by a gentleman named Danny something and I'm
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.420]   going to look this up because I've got the actual name.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:51.660]   But anyways, it was this famous talk he gave about life hacking and how computer developer
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.620]   types life hack.
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:08:01.260]   And on I believe Boing Boing, Cory Doctrow, if I'm remembering this right, posted his
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:07.060]   notes from this talk and it was a pretty, oh, Danny O'Brien, not Danny Lewin, Danny
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.060]   O'Brien.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.060]   2005.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:15.460]   So look, I'm looking it up in real time.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.700]   Blah blah blah.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.900]   The term life hack was coined in 2004 during the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.740]   It's coined by technology journalist, journalist Danny O'Brien to describe the embarrassing
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.920]   scripts and shortcuts productive IT professionals use to get their work done.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.340]   And then Merlin Mann ran with that notion.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.580]   Okay, so Danny O'Brien was talking about how IT professionals use these macros and
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.320]   shortcuts in a text editor.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.980]   How they would run their whole lives out of these text editors.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.060]   So real early in this notion of digitally enhanced productivity was this idea of life
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.000]   hacking, which became to encompass everything.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.540]   But when it was first introduced, it was what IT nerds would do to track their life and
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.100]   they would keep track of everything in their life in these text files.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:07.060]   And so I'm sure that's where I was exposed to it through Merlin Mann and 43 Folders in
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.060]   that 2007, 2008 period.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.940]   So I bet that's how I was exposed to it.
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.940]   But that's it.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:18.020]   It's a whole interesting history, by the way, the whole life hack history.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.020]   What about when you're walking around?
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.500]   Do you have like a file on your phone?
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.500]   I don't.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.500]   I don't.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.420]   So it depends on how long the walk is.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.260]   So I'll typically have my bag with me.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.860]   I'll have a notebook in it and I can capture thoughts.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.460]   But yeah, if you're on foot and this is like a productive meditation, right, is working
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.960]   through ideas just in your head.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:44.260]   You're much worse at it than if you're sitting at a computer with the plain text file.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.700]   But it's a really good exercise because A, it expands your ability to concentrate and
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.220]   focus just that discipline of keeping track of things in your head.
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.220]   And B, the walking can unlock things.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.920]   It can unlock creative connections that you don't get sitting down.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.180]   So you almost have two options here.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.580]   And I'm focusing now on trying to have big ideas or like original ideas.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.820]   You can sit at a screen and expand your working memory with a plain text file and try to move
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.580]   ideas around and figure things out.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.580]   Or you can go for a walk.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.980]   You don't have as big of a working memory to work with, but you get the ambulation bonus,
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.380]   this idea that walking can unlock other types of connections.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.260]   So it's sort of like two different types of cognition.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:27.220]   But certainly I am kind of committed or I don't know how to plan anymore, especially
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.260]   planning email, trying to figure out, OK, I have to book my travel for something.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.940]   Those type of seemingly mundane tasks actually have with them seven or eight different things
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.420]   that have to happen that connect and dates that matter.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.380]   I don't know how to do that anymore if I can't have a text file to start moving all this
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.380]   information.
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.380]   Right.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.500]   Part of it, too, is like my next question is when you're writing, do you like and you're
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.660]   working on whatever you're working on, do you and something comes up that's not related?
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.660]   Do you write on that a lot?
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.660]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.660]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.660]   Does that happen a lot?
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.660]   Look, I have my computer open.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.100]   So let me load this up.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.820]   All right.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.220]   So on mine now, it's called WM2.txt.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.140]   WM2.txt was my working memory text file.
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.460]   It turns out when you keep a text file open on your computer for years, like weird stuff
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.580]   happens at some point.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.580]   I don't know.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.020]   I just couldn't access that file anymore.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.860]   So I moved on to WM2.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.380]   And I'm looking at it now.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.380]   The first item is a GU mailbox colon to grade request.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.940]   So there's like two students who are asking for their current grades.
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.660]   And I came across that and I know I need to do that.
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.980]   And so I'm just noting it there to there's another.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.860]   And it's literally just a hyphen, plain text hyphen.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.300]   The next thing says schedule new haircut.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.140]   So I was supposed to get my haircut yesterday.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.140]   My stylist got COVID.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.820]   They're like, I have to reschedule.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.700]   And I was like, I can't do this right now.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.940]   So I just wrote down schedule new haircut.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.940]   And now that's going to sit there and I'll see it.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.940]   I'm not going to forget.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:06.100]   And then I have 330 office hours Zoom because there was, as I mentioned, I was like, oh,
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.980]   at the last second as I was coming over here, a student asked if they could ask me some
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.420]   questions about an exam on Zoom.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.940]   And I told them we could use the office hours, Zoom room, et cetera.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.580]   Boom, it's just on here.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.260]   And I see this every time I open it.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:22.860]   So this is just stuff on my mind is no longer on my mind.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:28.340]   And the other thing I'll do is I'll put equal signs, a bunch of equal signs to make divider
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.480]   horizontal divider lines.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.300]   So if I want to just have a space for just messing around with things, I put a bunch
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.280]   of equal signs and like below it, I'm just messing around with notes.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.980]   And typically at the top of my text file is like things I don't want to forget tasks to
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.460]   deal with or process.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:45.060]   And then if I want to think about another thing, I might put another bunch of horizontal
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:50.220]   equal signs and so kind of create these little spaces where I can just mess around with.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.280]   I guess it's one last clarification question.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.320]   So like when you're walking around, like doing an errand or something and you don't have
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.740]   like your phone or you don't happen to have a notebook, what do you, I guess you always
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.900]   have like a piece of paper.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.100]   So you just write it on that.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.100]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.100]   And if I don't, I just, you know, holding it.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.100]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.100]   Got it.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.100]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.460]   And then you write it down at the end of the day, you look at that notebook and then
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.460]   you look at your file.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.460]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.060]   So if I'm just thinking about something when I'm walking and I just have it in my head,
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.900]   I'm going to write it down as soon as I get back.
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.900]   Got it.
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.900]   And that's another great thing.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.660]   It's an incredibly low friction to just drop it into a text file.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.180]   Just whatever, however you want to summarize.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.620]   That's why I used to say freestyle productivity.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.620]   I don't care how you do it.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.980]   Just get it in there.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.680]   You know what you mean.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.780]   Whatever formatting you want to do, just get it in there and then it's out of your head.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.780]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.100]   So anyways, that is the most important piece of productivity software that you already
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.220]   own, but you're not using is your text editor.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.540]   And maybe in the future we'll have like an augmented reality thing or wherever you are,
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.020]   it's like, boom, you pull up this thing.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.820]   I can just like drop thoughts into it and then boom, like make it go away.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.940]   It's like always kind of there with you with some sort of like AI agent that like help
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.260]   you like a Siri type thing.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.740]   I can see how this goes.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.980]   I mean, we could try, this would be difficult, but we could try to have a high price software
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.620]   project product.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.640]   It's actually just a text file.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.660]   In the meantime, I think we had like really good marketing for it.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.340]   And it was, there was like a really compelling YouTube video where people are getting on
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.900]   private jets and this and that.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.140]   And it's just like a really slick sound effect when it turns on.
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:28.940]   And in the end people don't realize that it's just the text, the text editor for only $49.95
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.940]   a month.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:37.820]   You too can unlock your productivity brilliance with WM2, the most important piece of productivity
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.300]   software, which is true, ever invented.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.820]   And all it is is like a little script that just opens a notebook.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.260]   [Music]
