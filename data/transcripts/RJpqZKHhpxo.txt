[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.000]   in the first chapter of the book of Job.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.680]   And I shall read from verse 20 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:19.200]   Verses 20, 21, and 22 in the first chapter of the book of Job.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:28.360]   Then Job arose and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:36.960]   worshipped, and said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960]   thither.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.440]   The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.760]   In all this, Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:08.560]   It seems to me that there is no more ridiculous, or futile, or indeed puerile attitude towards
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.480]   the Bible, or criticism of the Bible, than that which regards it as something that is
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:28.320]   remote from life, something which is not practical, something which is entirely devast from the
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.440]   practicalities of life.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.800]   Now, there are many people who take that view of the Bible.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.920]   Oh, they say it's a book which has got a good deal of beautiful poetry in it.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.680]   At certain times, no doubt, it's soothing and comforting and very beautiful and wonderful,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.840]   but they say, after all, it's an old book and it's out of date, and it doesn't help
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.960]   us in the practical business of living life in 1953.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.580]   It's all right for those who have brought up on it, perhaps, and who have made a habit
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.800]   and a custom of reading it all their lives, but they just feel that it's, somehow or another,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.080]   far away from life, as it actually and rarely is.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.960]   There are many people who take up that attitude towards the Bible, and that's why they've
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.480]   never read it, and that's why, especially, they've never read the Old Testament.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.260]   They feel that it's something, as I say, which represents a mere stage in the development
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.040]   of men, something which comes from the more primitive stages in the development of men,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   and therefore, clearly, something which has nothing to give us at this present time.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:47.840]   Now, the Bible's own claim is to give the lie direct to that view.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:58.720]   The Bible's claim, indeed, is this, that it, and it alone, can teach us how to live truly,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:10.160]   happily, successfully, and triumphantly in this present world, at this present hour.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.880]   And that is, certainly, the claim which I would make followed.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.360]   That is why I believe it.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.320]   That is why I preach it.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.920]   I want to put that quite clearly, and as forcefully as I can.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:33.440]   The claim which we make for this book is that it is God's book, and that the Bible alone,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.160]   exclusively, is the only book that can teach us, and enable us, and show us the way to
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.560]   live life fully, to live it truly, to live it happily, to live it successfully, to live
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.600]   it triumphantly.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.120]   I say that because the Bible is the only book which enables us to face all the facts of
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.520]   life.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.200]   And again, I'm making this comprehensive claim.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.600]   The Bible, I say, helps us to understand life from every aspect, from every angle.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.720]   There is nothing about life that it doesn't deal with.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.080]   It deals with the origin of life, and of men in life, and in this world.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.640]   It gives us a meaning and an explanation of life.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.000]   It explains the problems and the difficulties, the unhappinesses of life, and all these other
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   things.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.160]   The Bible has explanations of all those things.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.360]   And at the same time, I say, it tells us how we can be delivered and extricated from our
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   involvement in these problems and difficulties and failures.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   And indeed, it goes further, and teaches us not only about life in this world, but our
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:00.720]   life after we've left this world, and go on beyond the veil to that unknown eternity
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.440]   that lies beyond it.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.400]   Now that is the Bible's claim.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:16.200]   All other teachings—and the Bible tells us this also—all other teachings are partial.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.320]   Now I care not what particular teaching you're interested in.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.640]   I suggest to you that it's always a partial teaching.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.200]   To some people, you see, politics is everything.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.340]   Well, politics is very important, but it doesn't deal with the whole of life.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.240]   Politics is all right in its realm and in its sphere, but when you're suddenly face
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.120]   to face with a disaster, or with death, politics has got nothing to tell you.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.480]   Other men are interested in art, and others are interested in science.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.920]   You are familiar with these various interests and these various ways of looking at life
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.520]   that are popular at the present time.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.360]   What I'm saying about them all is that every single one of them is partial.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.720]   It may tell you a great deal about certain aspects of life.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.120]   It may be very helpful to you and very useful to you at certain points, in certain places,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.440]   or at certain times in your life.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:25.080]   But there isn't another single view of life in this world which embraces the whole of
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:36.760]   life, which caters for every conceivably eventuality in life, save the Bible itself.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:44.920]   Now I make bold to make that assertion without any fear of contradiction.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.960]   And it is an assertion I am ready to demonstrate and to defend anywhere.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:58.160]   There is no other view of life in this world tonight facing men, which takes in the whole,
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.400]   takes in everything, save this.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.460]   The Bible, I say, not only tells us how to live life when the sun is shining and when
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.840]   all is going well.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:17.040]   The Bible helps us to face life when everything seems to have gone wrong.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.080]   When the tribulations and the trials and the catastrophes and the calamities come, the
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.800]   Bible still goes on speaking.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.240]   The novels don't help you then.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.880]   The jazz music is no use then.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.960]   All the so-called romance of the films, oh, it seems so tawdry and insulting.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.800]   When you're face to face with these basic and elemental things.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.720]   Didn't you feel it during this past week, how you'd have liked to have changed some
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.760]   of the BBC programs, how ridiculous they seemed when men and women were face to face with
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.600]   ultimate things.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:59.120]   Now I say the Bible tells us that it and it alone can face all these various things.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.880]   And what we have in this particular chapter that we're looking at tonight is the Bible
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:15.120]   helping us and enabling us to face the calamities that come in life, the disasters, the terrible
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.360]   events that happen.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.080]   You remember the description that is given here of them, how these men came one after
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.860]   another to Job with their reports of terrible things that had taken place.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.000]   You remember the last one while he was yet speaking, "There came also another and said,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.440]   'Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.560]   And behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.760]   house and it fell upon the young men and their dead.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.840]   And I alone am escaped, and I only am escaped alone to tell."
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:00.240]   One by one they came, telling him of the destruction of his animals, his wonderful possessions,
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.680]   how suddenly he is robbed of everything, and finally his children.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:13.220]   That's the theme, the theme with which this chapter deals.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:19.260]   Now let me make it quite clear as we come to consider it, what exactly the chapter does
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:25.020]   tell us and what we are proposing to do.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:31.580]   The chapter is not concerned, finally, to tell us or to explain to us why these calamities
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.580]   happen.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.560]   I have no doubt that there are many tonight who are considering that.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.540]   Why do such things take place?
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.420]   Because when terrible things happen, people are very prone to say, "Why does God allow
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.420]   this?"
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:51.180]   Job's wife put that question.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.260]   She said, "What's the point of going on like this?"
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.780]   Then said his wife unto Job, "Dost thou still retain thine integrity?
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:05.620]   Curse God and die."
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.980]   And you will find always at such times that people begin to say, "Well, now if there
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.460]   is a God and if God is a God of love as the Bible claims, why does he allow things like
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.460]   this to take place?"
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.740]   That's the thing they want to have discussed.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.780]   Why do these things happen?
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:27.100]   The Bible is a great deal to tell us about that subject, and yet in a way there is a
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.060]   great deal which it does not tell us about that subject.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.780]   The teaching of the Bible seems to be that if we put the question in the way that I've
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:42.100]   just put it to you now, it is nothing but a sheer impertinence.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.580]   And the last people to have an answer to the question are the people who put it in that
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:52.300]   way.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.820]   This whole question is a great one.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:00.140]   It's an involved one, and it's a difficult one.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:05.420]   And the Bible, I say, doesn't pretend nor offer to give us any final light upon it.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.020]   It does tell us this much.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.320]   The teaching of this particular chapter is, of course, as you realize, that the calamity
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.260]   there was produced by Satan.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.840]   Satan was given certain abilities and powers by God, and here, because of the challenge
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:31.480]   of Satan concerning Job to God, God says, "Very well, then, test him."
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:39.540]   And Satan proceeded to do these things that are here described.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.320]   That is a good deal, as a matter of fact, of the biblical explanation as to why things
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.840]   like this happen.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:52.160]   If you want a brief and a succinct answer to the question, "Why do calamities happen
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.360]   in this world of time?"
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.800]   the essential biblical answer is, "They happen because of sin."
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:07.240]   If men had not sinned, if sin and evil had never entered into this world, then we can
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.840]   be absolutely certain that no calamities and troubles would ever have happened or would
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.720]   ever have been experienced.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.100]   That's the essential biblical teaching.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:25.600]   These things are the direct outcome of sin and evil and men's disobedience of God.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:32.760]   Disease and pestilence and calamities and all these things have resulted directly from
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.240]   men's disobedience.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.240]   God made the world perfect.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.880]   He called it paradise.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.760]   He saw that it was good and nothing like this could have happened in it.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.000]   All these things are the direct outcome of sin.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.840]   So my friend, if you are concerned about this problem, I suggest to you that instead of
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:57.480]   trying to understand God, you'd better try to understand the problem of sin.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:03.200]   That's the essence of the biblical explanation of these matters.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.920]   Let me go further.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:12.500]   The Bible does not promise us anywhere that these things are not going to happen.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.140]   That is why it is an utter travesty of the gospel to say that it is some sort of soothing
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:22.000]   syrup which tells people, "Believe this and you'll never have any more troubles."
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.360]   Or "Because God is a God of love, anything is never going to go wrong."
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.560]   Not at all.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:34.360]   The Bible tells us that there will be wars and rumors of wars and earthquakes and pestilences
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.200]   and calamities.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:42.840]   The Bible tells us very plainly and clearly that while there is sin left in this world,
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.560]   things like this are going to happen.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.360]   So that anybody who believes the Bible and who is a Christian should never be surprised
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.880]   at these things.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.680]   And it is only people who are ignorant of the biblical teaching who seem to think that
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.520]   at last they've got an unanswerable case against God.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.160]   They say, "You proclaim a God who is a God of love, look what happens."
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.920]   The Bible tells you both.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:11.240]   It tells you that these things are going to happen because of evil and because of sin.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:18.480]   Indeed, we can go further and say this.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:25.520]   From the biblical standpoint, it seems to me, the remarkable thing is that worse things
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.780]   don't happen.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.960]   Think what you feel like doing to somebody who does something against you.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:41.200]   Think of the things we've often done to people who've hurt us or offended us.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:48.600]   Oh yes, we all know something about killing cruiser with our mouths.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:56.800]   The amazing thing I say is this, that the holy, righteous, and eternal God tolerates
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.040]   men as he does.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:06.840]   That he long since hasn't wiped men and his entire universe out of existence.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.180]   That is surely the extraordinary and surprising thing.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:18.400]   That God can still cause his Son to rise upon the evil and the good and send rain upon the
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.840]   just and the unjust.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:27.480]   The amazing thing is that God gives such health and strength and prosperity and powers to
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.400]   men who ignore him and who even curse him to his face.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.120]   That's the problem to me.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.800]   That's the amazing thing.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.920]   Not that calamities do happen or are permitted by God to happen at times, but that they happen
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.880]   so infrequently.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:50.240]   And that God is so amazingly good and so amazingly kind to mankind.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.440]   Very well then, I say the Bible teaches us that these things will happen.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.760]   But there will never be a time in the world when they will not happen until the Son of
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:09.280]   God finally returns into this world and once and forever finishes with sin and evil and
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.360]   returns the perfect kingdom to his Father.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   The Bible, in other words, is not so much concerned about that aspect of the matter
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.120]   as this.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.320]   What are we to do about these things?
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.240]   How are we to face them?
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.360]   If I say we are living in a world in which this sort of thing can happen at any moment
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:35.640]   and we know not when, well how can we face them?
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:40.080]   How can we bring ourselves to meet these things?
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.920]   That's the question.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.160]   That's the practical question.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.640]   I say that you and I are never going to understand the problem of evil fully while we're in this
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.200]   life and in this world.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.960]   It's beyond us entirely.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.920]   It's a great mystery in the mind and the heart of God.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:00.120]   But there is a very practical problem and we should address ourselves to it.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.040]   In view of the fact that I'm subject to this sort of thing at any moment, how can I prepare
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:11.320]   myself so that if ever I am met with this sort of thing, I shall never be taken unawares
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.960]   and unprepared, but shall always be ready for it?
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.880]   That's the theme of this chapter.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:26.760]   And I would remind you that it's but a typical illustration and example of what the Bible
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.000]   has to teach us in this connection.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.720]   Job is but one illustration of large numbers which I could put before you, which are to
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.040]   be found in the Old Testament and in the New.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:49.600]   The case of the Bible is this, that in this life and in this world where we are subject
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:56.520]   to all these things, where we are constantly at the mercy, as it were, of these things
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:04.120]   to which flesh is heir, the world can be divided into two groups.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:10.520]   There are people who are completely shattered by them, people who don't understand them,
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:16.840]   who are baffled and bewildered, and who, if they think at all, I say, are utterly baffled,
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.880]   or else perhaps decide not to think at all because thinking is painful.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.960]   There are people who are in some shape or form just defeated completely by them.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:33.040]   On the other hand, there are people like this man Job, who when the most terrible disasters
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:43.280]   happen to him, simply seem to stand like great mountain peaks in the midst of the storm,
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:53.520]   with a dignity and a greatness, a superiority to it all, that is truly glorious and magnificent.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.840]   That's the great theme of the Bible.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.560]   There are people like this who triumph over it all, who can be more than conquerors.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.400]   You've got a great list of them in the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, but
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:10.320]   you can go through the Old Testament and find them for yourselves, and they're all the same.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.160]   The same explanation is true of every single one of them.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.360]   It isn't that one man had a particular secret and another another.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.440]   No, no.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.080]   These men all behave in the same way for the same reason.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:28.160]   It's always the one and the same explanation.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.880]   And the question is, what is that explanation?
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:37.000]   Now that's the thing I want to put to you briefly tonight, as it is put to us in this
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.320]   first chapter of the book of Job.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.480]   And fortunately here, it seems to me to be put in the form of a contrast.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:51.120]   There is a kind of implied contrast in this chapter, as I understand it, between Job himself
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.000]   and Job's children.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.680]   And in Job's children and Job himself, I think you have depicted and delineated in
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:06.920]   a very perfect way, these two final fundamental attitudes to life and all its attendant circumstances
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.320]   and, especially, its calamities.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.800]   And all I want to do, therefore, is to hold these two pictures before you and just comment
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.440]   upon them as we look at them together.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.360]   First of all, let us take a brief glance at Job's children.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.880]   The same thing, alas, was true of Job's wife as was true of the children, in a sense.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.080]   But at any rate, we know this very well about the children of Job.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.600]   We realize very clearly what their attitude was to life.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.520]   It was a thoughtless one.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.960]   It was heedless.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.800]   It was unprepared.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.240]   I am not judging them, I am simply describing them.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:55.960]   It is quite clear that these people, these children of Job, were indeed very typical
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.200]   and representative modern people in many ways.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.340]   Their one idea was to have the so-called good time.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.780]   You can read about them and see their photographs almost every evening in some of the evening
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:14.360]   papers at their drinks and dances and great occasions with their wonderful dresses, how
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.960]   bright and glorious and amazing it seems.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.040]   Well, Job's children were like that, always having parties.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.720]   They seemed to live to plan parties.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.520]   And off they went, they did not think much of anything else but having the next party.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   Whose turn was it?
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.960]   They all went together and there they were drinking their wine and having a marvelous
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.440]   and amazing good time.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.200]   But we are told here, it seems to me very, very clearly, that they did not think much
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:46.040]   about life because their father, who knew them so well, we are told, used to pray for
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.720]   them and used to offer his sacrifices.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:56.360]   He used to say, "It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts."
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.080]   He was worried about them.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.520]   He was unhappy about them.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:07.980]   He could see this typical, thoughtless attitude towards life, this mere living for pleasures
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.600]   and for the next thing that came along and turned up.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.840]   And he said, "Oh, I am afraid of them."
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.640]   In this drunken condition, with this wine of theirs, they may have said something that
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.300]   will lead to an estrangement between them and God.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:28.700]   So he prayed for them and offered his sacrifices.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.320]   That seems to me to be the picture of Job's children.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.960]   Oh, we are given many accounts of such people in the Bible.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.940]   Listen to our Lord himself describing this kind of person.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:48.680]   As it was, he says, in the days of Noah, they were eating and drinking and marrying and
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:58.240]   giving in marriage, building and planting houses, and knew not until the flood came
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   and took them all away.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:05.800]   That is how people were before the flood, exactly as the majority seem to be today.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:12.120]   Eating, drinking, marrying, giving in marriage, planning, settling down houses.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.360]   Oh, marvelous it all seems!
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.000]   Never a thought about these things.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.880]   The flood comes suddenly and it is all over before you know where you are and you have
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:28.760]   time to put yourself right with God or really face the ultimate questions of life and eternity.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:35.120]   It was exactly the same before Sodom and Gomorrah, according to our Lord himself.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.600]   Well, I do not want to stay with this.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:48.640]   But there it is, I say, in its essence, in Job's unthinking, heedless children who
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:56.320]   were just out for a good time, whose whole philosophy was, "Make the best of it while
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.320]   you have got it.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.320]   Do not go to me troubles.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.440]   Do not be serious and do not think.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.440]   Spend all your money.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.240]   Do not consider the next day.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.680]   Live from hand to mouth.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.160]   Just have a jolly good time while you can.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160]   That's it.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.160]   That's the attitude.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:23.040]   I don't want to go on to say that often coupled with that, there is a ridicule poured
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.800]   upon people who do stop to think.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.080]   And those of us who are Christian are regarded as, oh, just out of date and behind the times
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:39.880]   and rather hopeless, antiquated persons, some sort of anachronisms in this modern world.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.360]   There it is.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:47.480]   And suddenly in the midst of the jollification and the feasting, a girl arises out of a desert
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:52.000]   and comes, and before they know what's happened, they're dead.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.920]   That's the picture.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:02.520]   It's not for me to condemn that attitude to life, but I just want to hold opposite
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.200]   to that a most amazing contrast.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   It's the contrast of this man, Job.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:16.720]   Here he is, messengers come in one after another, telling him of the loss of all his goods and
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:24.080]   possessions and finally the death of all his children.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.240]   And then I read this.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.920]   I think it's one of the most magnificent and tremendous pictures which you'll find
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.720]   in any literature anywhere, even in the Bible itself.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:50.560]   As a picture of sheer dignity and greatness and calmness and poise and balance and equanimity,
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.640]   it's unmatched.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:13.240]   And Job arose and rent his mantle and shed his head and fell upon the ground and worshipped
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:24.240]   and said, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:31.240]   The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:37.400]   Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:44.920]   Now I confess there's one thing I can't understand, how anybody can look even cursorily
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:52.040]   and superficially at these two pictures, and not at once and inevitably feel that for every
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.160]   reason the second must be the right one.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.560]   Why if Christianity were not true I'd have to believe it.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.080]   The other seems so hopeless to me, so superficial.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:11.800]   And then there's such a greatness and a magnificence about this.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   But I don't want to leave it as a general picture.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:21.920]   I want to show you how the Scripture itself analyzes the whole thing for us.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.480]   The great question is, how can we be like Job?
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.640]   How can we become such men and women when, though the worst should happen to us and our
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:38.880]   whole world may collapse round about us, we can rise up like a great mountain peak, out
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:48.360]   of it all, and stand there looking to God and to heaven, unmoved and undisturbed?
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:53.600]   Well here are the explanations given in the Scripture.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.880]   What was Job's secret?
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.320]   Well the first thing that I'm told about Job is this, that he had a right attitude towards
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:06.640]   himself and a right attitude towards his life in this world.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:17.520]   You see the first words this man utters are these, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.800]   and naked shall I return thither."
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:29.200]   Now in effect he said this, "Here I am," said Job, "an hour ago I was the wealthiest
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.560]   man in the world.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.800]   I've got more sheep and cattle and camels than anybody else.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.000]   I have these children of mine.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.040]   My world seemed an absolutely perfect one in every respect.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   But suddenly I find myself bereft of everything, all my goods and possessions and my children
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.520]   have gone.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.280]   What is this life of mine?
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.400]   What am I?
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.600]   What is this world in which I find myself?
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.800]   What is it all about?
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.560]   I've suddenly lost everything.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.280]   Well then has everything gone?
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.480]   Have I gone with it?"
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.840]   "No," says Job, "I haven't."
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:16.240]   And he rises up out of it all, and then he immediately thinks of God, so he falls prostrate
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:23.720]   to the ground and he looks up and he speaks and he says, "God I thank thee that thou
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.680]   hast taught me the truth about myself and about my life in this world."
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.680]   What is it?
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.400]   Well it's this.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:38.200]   We come into this world with nothing except ourselves.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:43.740]   That's how everybody's life starts.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.040]   You start with nothing but yourself.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.080]   You haven't a single possession.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.920]   You have nothing except the soul that God has given you.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.440]   That's all you've got.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.040]   You've got this amazing thing that God has given you in your little body.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.760]   That's exactly what you are and all you have.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.440]   You're absolutely naked.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.600]   You've got nothing at all.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.200]   Not a shred, not a vestige of a garment of any description.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.520]   Totally naked.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:18.520]   And it's equally true to say, as Job reminds us here, that every single one of us will
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.840]   go out of the world exactly like that.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   Now I can't understand anybody, I say again, who doesn't realize this.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.740]   I still less can understand anybody who objects to it or wants to argue with it.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:38.800]   The astounding thing is how any one of us can live for a single day without realizing
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.220]   that simple truth.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.720]   But isn't this what happens to all of us?
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:49.380]   We come like that, naked into this world, then immediately we begin to accumulate things.
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:55.040]   I'm given a rattle or a dummy or a doll and it's mine.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.500]   And I don't want anybody else to have it.
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.400]   Then I see another child with one and I want that one as well.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.580]   You're fighting for possessions always.
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:07.260]   If every man in the world realized this, there'd never be another war because people would
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.860]   see at once that nothing's worth fighting about in an ultimate sense.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.460]   You're fighting for possessions always.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.020]   Not only would you and I and our lives be different, but the whole world would very
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.020]   soon be different.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:23.660]   And what's the point of fighting for things that you may be robbed of in a second, things
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:28.780]   that you're certainly going to be robbed of by death at the end?
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.740]   So all jealousy and rivalry and envy because somebody else is getting a bigger wage or
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:39.640]   salary or is more prominent in his profession, all these things would go because a man would
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.900]   say to himself, "There not was it.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.420]   I myself will soon be left with nothing.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.420]   So will all they."
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.420]   No, no.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.420]   There is no hope in conferences.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.420]   There is no hope in marching.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.420]   There is no hope in moral influence.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.420]   There is no hope in legislation.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:55.820]   There is no hope in all the affairs of men.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.820]   But here is a hope.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.460]   Here is life.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.900]   The universe is still God's.
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.180]   God made it.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.820]   And God has not abandoned it.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.860]   The world is going to be changed.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.660]   It's going to be redeemed.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:20.100]   There is to be a regeneration of the whole cosmos.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:25.700]   And it is the activity of this Christ that does it.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.260]   He didn't come to tell us to be better.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.820]   We can't be better.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.620]   He didn't come to give us an example.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.620]   He came to do something for us.
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.300]   And what he has done, I say he has done.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.180]   The world is as it is because of the darkness.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.900]   And he has come to dispel the darkness.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.780]   The light to lighten the Gentiles hath appeared.
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.740]   The day star from on high hath arisen.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:52.380]   The light, the light of God has come into the world.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:58.220]   And the darkness shall be finally dissipated and dispelled.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:05.620]   And Jesus shall reign where'er the sun doth his successive journeys run.
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:20.140]   His kingdom stretch from shore to shore till moons shall wax and wane no more.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.860]   There is no other hope but there is hope in him.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.580]   He is the Lord of history.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.420]   The world is his.
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.860]   The Father has given him the kingdom.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.580]   And he will finish the work.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.580]   He came.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.140]   He did the preliminary work.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.420]   He is waiting until his enemy shall be made his footstool.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:45.700]   He will come again riding the clouds of heaven and destroy his every enemy, his every foe,
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:52.380]   and set up his everlasting kingdom.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.580]   That's what he tells us.
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:02.780]   That is his message about the world this evening.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:07.980]   He is the light of the world.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:13.740]   He is the only light.
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.460]   Man cannot save the world.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.140]   Man cannot change it.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.540]   History is proving it.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.780]   The world tonight is proving it.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.660]   Look at it.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.020]   There is no hope.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:32.740]   But here is the hope, the blessed hope, the coming again of the Son of God to finish the
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:46.980]   work and finally to hand the kingdom perfect and entire to his Holy Father.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:54.660]   That is the message with regard to the world in general.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.780]   What of you?
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.460]   Where do you come in in all this?
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.900]   Are you in that world?
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.460]   Are you in the dark?
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:13.620]   If you are and you die like that, you will suffer the fate of the darkness and of the
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.020]   fallen world.
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:22.300]   But you notice that he indicates there is a way out.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:31.260]   He that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness but shall have the light of life.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:38.340]   My dear friend, you can be rescued and redeemed out of this fallen, sinful, doomed world this
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.860]   evening.
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:45.060]   You pin your faith to world reformation and you'll go down in despair with the world and
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.060]   you'll be lost.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.060]   But you needn't.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:53.120]   Though the world cannot be saved in that sense, you can.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:59.960]   You can be saved out of this present evil world.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:10.480]   The Christ who came to conquer Satan and to dispel the darkness came to save you.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.980]   He not only took human nature upon himself, he took our sins upon himself.
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.140]   He bore their punishment.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.700]   He died our death.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.260]   He has risen again for our justification.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.180]   He has gone into heaven to prepare a place for us.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.500]   That is the message.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.900]   The world cannot be bettered.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:38.140]   It is mastered by this darkness, the darkness of the devil and of hell.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:43.060]   And there is only one light that can set us free from it and show us the way to God.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.580]   He is the one.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.220]   He doesn't tell you to save yourself.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.260]   He tells you that he saves you.
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.260]   It isn't his teaching.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.460]   It's what he's done.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:57.460]   I and I alone am the light.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.700]   He's taken your nature.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.260]   He's taken your sin.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.740]   He's taken your punishment.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.540]   He's been buried in your grave.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.540]   He's risen.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.460]   He's interceding for you.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:13.740]   He, the Christ himself, not slogans, not philosophy, not teaching, not ideas.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:23.540]   I and I alone, the person, am the light of the world.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.620]   Are you following him?
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.500]   Are you walking in his light?
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:39.180]   Are you looking only unto him and resting upon him and his finished work?
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:53.700]   And are you looking for his blessed, his glorious appearing and the final glorious consummation?
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:58.740]   Thank God we are not left to ourselves.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.700]   We are not left to men, however great and noble and wonderful.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.700]   God is interested.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.700]   God loves the world.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:11.100]   God has so loved it that he gave his only begotten son.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:25.260]   But whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.260]   Have you got it?
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.500]   Turn to the light.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:46.260]   Look to him and be ye saved.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:53.540]   Amen.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:57.460]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
