[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040]   - Well, how do we rid ourselves of low thoughts about Christ?
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.320]   Well, we banish them by filling our minds and hearts
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.120]   with the wealth of revelation of who Christ is.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.240]   And that's what we're doing in the month of December
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.400]   leading up to Christmas.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.640]   To this end, I have convinced Pastor John
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.360]   to read a few chapters from his excellent book,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.760]   "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ."
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.560]   This is sort of a first nudge to see
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.640]   if Pastor John will read the entire book
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.440]   and make it his first audio book
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.740]   at some point in the future.
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.640]   To that end, he recently recorded a second chapter for us,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520]   for you, the APJ audience,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.440]   and you're hearing this for the very first time.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.000]   So here now is Pastor John reading chapter two
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.320]   from his wonderful book, "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ,"
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.680]   on the remedy for low thoughts about Christ.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.720]   - Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.960]   John 8, verse 58.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.720]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.160]   and the Word was God.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.480]   John 1, verse 1.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.480]   For in Christ, the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.420]   Colossians 2, verse 9.
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.320]   Chapter two.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.320]   Jesus is the glory of God, the deity of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.480]   Christ does not exist in order to make much of us.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.480]   We exist in order to enjoy making much of him.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.200]   The assumption of this book is that
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.120]   to know the glories of Christ is an end, not a means.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.120]   Christ is not glorious so that we get wealthy or healthy.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.240]   Christ is glorious so that rich or poor, sick or sound,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.540]   we might be satisfied in him.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.340]   The first particular glory that upholds all the rest
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.340]   is the mere eternal existence of Christ.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.220]   If we will simply ponder this as we ought,
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.340]   a great ballast will come into the tipping ship
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.100]   of our souls.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.100]   Sheer existence is perhaps the greatest mystery of all.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.400]   Ponder the absoluteness of reality.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.900]   There had to be something that never came into being.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.160]   Back, back, back we peer into endless ages,
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.920]   yet there never was nothing.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.620]   Someone has the honor of being there first,
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.620]   and always he never became or developed.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.720]   He simply was.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   To whom belongs this singular, absolute glory?
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.800]   The answer is Christ,
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.640]   the person whom the world knows as Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.980]   The apostle John, who wrote the last book of the Bible,
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.520]   received the decisive revelation.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.400]   He quotes God, "I am the alpha and the omega,"
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.780]   says the Lord God, "who is and who was
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.600]   and who is to come, the Almighty."
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.320]   Revelation 1, verse 8.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.480]   This is not Christ talking.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.000]   This is the Almighty God.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.940]   He calls himself alpha and omega,
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.520]   the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.440]   In the alphabet, one cannot speak of anything
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.540]   or nothing before alpha.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.640]   There is no before alpha in the alphabet.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   Nor can one speak of anything or nothing after omega.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.520]   There is no after omega in the alphabet.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.060]   So it is with God and reality.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.840]   There is no before God and no after God.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.880]   He is absolutely there.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.980]   No matter how far back or how far forward you go,
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.660]   he is the absolute reality.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.440]   He has the honor of being there first and always.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.440]   To him belongs this singular glory.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.700]   This is the essential meaning of the Old Testament name,
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.660]   Yahweh or Jehovah.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.420]   It is built on the verb to be.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.160]   When Moses asked God his name,
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.860]   God said to Moses, "I am who I am."
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.500]   Say this to the people of Israel.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.500]   I am has sent me to you, Exodus 3, verse 14.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.620]   This I am is unfolded by God in Isaiah
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.020]   as implying absolute, eternal reality, past and future.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.640]   You are my witnesses, declares the Lord,
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.240]   that you may know and believe me
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.440]   and understand that I am he.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.740]   Before me, no God was formed,
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.740]   nor shall there be any after me, Isaiah 43, verse 10.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.480]   To be I am is to be absolutely the first and the last.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.440]   No before and no after, simply I am.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.040]   God makes this explicit in Isaiah 44, verse six.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.000]   Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.320]   the Lord of hosts, I am the first and I am the last.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.000]   Besides me, there is no God.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.560]   And again, in Isaiah 48, verse 12,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.680]   listen to me, O Jacob and Israel, whom I called.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.960]   I am he, I am the first and I am the last.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.000]   This is his name, Yahweh, the one who absolutely,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.940]   eternally and invincibly is.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.300]   He has the unique honor and singular glory
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.300]   of always having been when nothing else was,
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.680]   nor will he be outlasted by anything.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.920]   This is what it means to be God.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.900]   What then does this have to do with Christ,
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.040]   whom we know as Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.820]   Everything.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.460]   The apostle John quoted Christ
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.580]   near the end of his revelation.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.680]   Behold, I am coming soon.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.620]   I am the alpha and the omega,
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.260]   the first and the last, the beginning and the end.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.260]   I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.200]   about these things for the churches.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.860]   Revelation 22, verses 12 and 13 and verse 16.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.540]   This is Christ talking, not God the Father.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.540]   Now, two cannot be alpha and omega
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.420]   unless they are one.
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.180]   Two cannot be absolutely first and last
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.280]   unless they are one.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.120]   Yet, Christ, who calls himself Jesus,
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   claims for himself the same honor and glory
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.500]   belonging to God the Almighty.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.500]   See also Revelation 1, verses 17 and 18, 2, verse 8.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.020]   Christ even took to himself
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.220]   the uniquely glorious name of God.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.660]   I am.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.900]   Jesus said to them,
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.420]   "Truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am."
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.120]   John 8, verse 58.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.420]   I am telling you this now, Jesus says to his disciples
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.020]   near the end of his life,
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.520]   "Before it takes place, that when it does take place,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.100]   you may believe that I am."
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.080]   John 13, verse 19, author's translation.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.540]   See also John 8, verse 24.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.640]   Nothing greater can any man say of himself.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.600]   It is true or it is blasphemy.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.420]   Christ was God or godless.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.120]   John knew which.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.500]   In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.680]   and the Word was God.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.420]   And the Word became flesh, the only son,
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.440]   some translations begotten, from the Father.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.720]   John 1, verse 1, verse 14.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   Jesus Christ, the Word, was begotten, not made,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.200]   and not at any point in time, but eternally.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   Two persons standing forth as one God, not two gods.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.960]   The Son begotten from the Father, one essential deity.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.280]   This is a great mystery, as we would expect it to be.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.980]   But it is what God has revealed about himself.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.420]   The apostle Paul also knew the unique glory
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.680]   that belonged to Christ.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.080]   He is, according to the flesh, the Christ,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   who is God, over all, blessed forever, amen.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.140]   Romans 9, verse 5.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.980]   Nevertheless, though he was in the form of God,
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.980]   he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.920]   but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.320]   Philippians 2, verses 6 and 7.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   Therefore, in him, the whole fullness of deity
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.400]   dwells bodily.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.320]   Colossians 2, verse 9.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.960]   See 1, verse 19.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   And we Christians are now waiting, not for a mere man,
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.320]   but for the appearing of the glory
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.320]   of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.000]   Titus 2, verse 13.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.040]   See also 2 Peter 1, verse 1.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.760]   This is why the writer to the Hebrews is so bold
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.760]   as to say, "All the angels worship Christ."
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.960]   He is not chief among angels who worship God.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.080]   He is worshiped by the angels as God.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.660]   And again, when God brings the firstborn into the world,
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.660]   he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.560]   Hebrews 1, verse 6.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.200]   For he is the creator of all that is,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   and he is himself God.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   Of the son, God says, "Your throne, O God,
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.040]   is forever and ever.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.640]   You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.020]   in the beginning."
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.740]   Hebrews 1, verses 8 and 10.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.620]   Thus the Father bears witness to the deity of the Son.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:24.620]   He is the radiance of the glory of God
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.740]   and the exact imprint of his nature.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.220]   And he upholds the universe by the word of his power.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.300]   Hebrews 1, verse 3.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.140]   Jesus Christ is the creator of the universe.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.460]   Jesus Christ is the Alpha and Omega,
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.040]   the first and the last.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:49.040]   Jesus Christ, the person, never had a beginning.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.500]   He is absolute reality.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.700]   He has the unparalleled honor and unique glory
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.020]   of being there first and always.
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.020]   He never came into being.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:07.200]   He was eternally begotten.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.200]   The Father has eternally enjoyed the radiance
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.820]   of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.820]   Hebrews 1, verse 3.
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.840]   In the person of his Son.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.660]   Seeing and savoring this glory
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.660]   is the goal of our salvation.
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.660]   Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.880]   be with me where I am to see my glory
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.260]   that you have given me.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.380]   John 17, verse 24.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.680]   To feast on this forever
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:51.960]   is the aim of our being created and our being redeemed.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:59.040]   A prayer, eternal Father, you never had a beginning.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.760]   You will never have an ending.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.060]   You are the Alpha and the Omega.
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.160]   This we believe because you have revealed it to us.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.020]   Our hearts leap up with gratitude
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.080]   that you have opened our eyes to see and know
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.080]   that Jesus Christ is your eternal, divine Son,
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.840]   begotten, not made, and that you, oh Father,
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.840]   and he, your Son, are one God.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   We tremble even to take such glorious truths on our lips
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.260]   for fear of dishonoring you
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.100]   with withering and inadequate words.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.660]   But we must speak because we must praise you.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.900]   Silence would shame us
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.260]   and the rocks themselves would cry out.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.700]   You must be praised for who you are
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.020]   in the world you have made.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.820]   And we must thank you because you have made us taste
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.260]   and see the glory of Jesus Christ, your Son.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.160]   Oh, to know him.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.020]   Father, we long to know him.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:11.020]   Banish from our minds low thoughts of Christ.
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.420]   Saturate our souls with the Spirit of Christ
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.500]   and all his greatness.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.220]   Enlarge our capacities to be satisfied
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.260]   in all that you are for us in him.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.620]   Where flesh and blood are impotent,
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.300]   reveal to us the Christ and rivet our attention
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.840]   and our affections on the truth and beauty
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.900]   of your all-glorious Son.
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:39.820]   And grant that whether rich or poor, sick or sound,
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.280]   we might be transformed by him
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:49.020]   and become an echo of his excellence in the world.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.540]   - Amen, that was chapter two from Pastor John's book,
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.440]   Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.260]   And wherever you're listening in the midst of your day,
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.180]   thanks for joining us.

[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.980]   Well, porcelain nativity sets are a popular choice
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.320]   for mantle decor in the Christian home this time of year.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.620]   But are sets like these forbidden from our places of worship
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.580]   by the second commandment?
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.160]   This is a great and timely question sent in to us
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.140]   by a listener named Lisa, and it's up next time.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.700]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, we'll see you on Friday.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.280]   (upbeat music)
