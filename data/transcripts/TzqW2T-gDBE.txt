[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   A few years back, I had a chance to sit down with some friends of ours at CCEF,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   the Christian Counseling and Educational Foundation in Philadelphia.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   This included Ed Welch, a Bible counselor and the author of a wonderful book
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   titled "Running Scared, Fear, Worry, and the God of Rest."
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Ed has called the battle against anxiety a blessed struggle,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   and I asked him how. How is this struggle against anxiety a blessed struggle?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   The battle against fear is a blessed struggle.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   That sounds a bit odd, doesn't it?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   But I think I've said those very things and thought those very things,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   so there's something to it.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And here's one of the ways to look at it.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   When John Wesley was dying, allegedly,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   he had a group of people around him just speaking and praying
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and reading the promises of God.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And he said to them, "Yes, all these things are true,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   but the greatest is this, God with us."
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And in that, the struggle with fear, if you're prone to fear and anxiety,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   it is a wonderful struggle, because it seems as though
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   the most beautiful things that God says are reserved to people who wrestle with fear.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Psalm 23, it all turns on, "I am with you."
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   "I am with you."
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I think for those who are interested in larger theological matters,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   there are these covenant renewal ceremonies that go through the Old Testament
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   where God rehearses the covenant.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It seems as though what's happening there is there are people who rightly should be afraid.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I mean, the covenant with Noah.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   What's going to happen the next time a cloud comes overhead?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And here's the Lord making promises.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And the promises to Noah, to Abraham, to Isaac, to others throughout the Old Testament,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   they are consistently, "I know you're going to have reasons to be afraid."
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So let me say it again.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Let me rehearse my promises to you once again.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So in that sense, it is a blessed struggle,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   because you anticipate hearing the most beautiful things that God says to human beings.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   That was Ed Welch.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Ed is the author of the book "Running Scared, Fear, Worry, and the God of Rest."
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   He has also written books like "When People are Big and God is Small"
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   and "Addictions, a Banquet in the Grave."
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   We will hear from Ed again next week.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   But tomorrow we hear from another one of our friends at CCEF, Dr. David Powleson,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   on exposing the roots of sinful anger.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   [END]
