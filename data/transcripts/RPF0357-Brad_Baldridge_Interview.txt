[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.920]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.160]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.920]   My guest today is Brad Baldridge from the website, podcast, business called TamingTheHighCostOfCollege.com.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.240]   Brad, do you think that children and paying for children's college is antithetical to
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.320]   financial independence or do you think that you can work out a plan where these two things
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.520]   can coexist?
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.120]   I think most families need to figure it out whether they like to or not.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.080]   Welcome to the show, sir.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.520]   Yeah, I'm glad to be here.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.920]   So we're going to talk about college, which is a hot topic, and we're going to try to
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.800]   give as much detailed information as possible, some real meat for my audience, some ideas,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.040]   both some mainstream ideas and some offbeat ideas.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.240]   But I'd like to start with your background.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.140]   You come from the financial planning world and you've approached this as a financial
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.140]   planning specialty.
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.040]   How did you wind up becoming an expert in the area of college planning?
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.820]   Well, I started like most financial planners and I worked with just about anybody and everybody.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.200]   And I realized that I started resonating with parents and one of their big concerns was
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.200]   college and retirement.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.060]   And as I learned more and worked on it harder, I realized that there's a huge need for families
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.960]   to really understand college as it gets more and more expensive in order to do it and do
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.080]   it well so that you don't mess up mom and dad's retirement, I guess, in general.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.440]   How long have you been practicing in this area?
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.240]   I've been a financial planner for about 20 years and about 10 years ago I started specializing
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.120]   and actually launched a couple of businesses around college planning.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.600]   So let's start with the changes.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.040]   Have you observed any cultural changes in our cultural attitude toward college and college
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.200]   planning in the last decade or two?
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   Absolutely.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.900]   The biggest change was in the economic downturn where up until that economic downturn, most
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.940]   people pretty much said, "I'm going to go to school.
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.820]   I'm going to get that piece of paper and I'm going to get a good job and that's just the
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.300]   way it works."
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.020]   And then when the economic downturn happened and some graduates struggled with finding
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.060]   work, all of a sudden it became, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.140]   Is it really worth it?"
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.740]   And the answer for many is, "Yes, it still is very much is worth it."
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.980]   But not all degrees and not all people should be going to college in my opinion.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.340]   I definitely saw that major change.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.380]   It seemed like, and I guess you're probably right with regard to the timing of it, but
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.580]   it does seem that there was a dramatic shift in the last decade from that cultural idea
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.940]   of college is just the way that you set up a good life to almost a cultural disdain.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.580]   I don't know that we're quite there but at least among my generation, the younger generation,
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.780]   I would say there's probably more disdain than there is admiration for the college path.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.460]   I've noticed a distinct age gap on this subject where when I speak with older people and they
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.140]   say, "Well, why are you so down on college?"
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.820]   You don't understand.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.100]   You're living in the world that existed 30 years ago, some people, but the world that's
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.100]   today is very different than it was for you.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.700]   And so it's definitely been fascinating for me to watch.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.740]   Have you observed the same age gap that I have in working with clients?
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.340]   Michael: Yes, absolutely.
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.740]   I obviously work a lot with parents more than I do with the actual students.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.300]   But even parents today are really examining it because it's getting so expensive that
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.380]   for many families, it's a big item now.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.660]   It's a major decision as to whether or not we're going to spend the kind of money to
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.780]   go to that expensive private school or just go to the state school.
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.340]   For some families, that's the type of decision.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.180]   For other families, it's, "Can we afford college at all?
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.980]   And is it worth it if we can't afford it to borrow that kind of money to make it happen?"
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.440]   And those kind of decisions now are a case-by-case basis.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.380]   It isn't an automatic, "Well, it always makes sense to do this."
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.500]   It's, "Well, it may make sense, but what are you going to do when you graduate?
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.060]   And what's your earning potential?
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.900]   And are you willing to take on debt or not?
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.140]   And is there an alternate path to get to where you're trying to go that doesn't include college
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.980]   or it includes less of college?"
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.740]   So what's actually happening with college costs?
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.380]   What are the actual trends?
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.380]   Right.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.140]   So college costs are going up, especially what I would call the top-line price, which
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:55.420]   is the official published price where Harvard is now over $70,000 a year all in, which is
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.660]   tuition, room and board, books, fees.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.580]   And there's a lot of schools in that realm between 65 and 70.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.820]   That's the high-priced name brand prestigious schools are all up there like that.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.080]   And then we have the state schools where maybe 20 to 30,000 for the flagship state school
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.380]   in your state, maybe less than that at some of the low-cost states and maybe more than
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.100]   that in a high-cost state.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.020]   Then you also have the out-of-state situation where it's more like 40,000.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.540]   So it's not nearly as bad as the high-priced privates.
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:36.820]   And then we have the low-priced privates that are 45, 50 comparable to the out-of-state
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.740]   prices.
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.780]   So there's a lot of different types of schools out there as far as kind of categories and
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.460]   how they work and whether or not you're going to qualify for aid, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.620]   And because it's getting so expensive now, I think most families need to spend a lot
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.180]   more time at it.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.740]   A typical family would spend a lot less time planning for college than they would, say,
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.660]   planning a large family vacation.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.020]   Yet now with college being so expensive, you really need to put some time and effort into
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.100]   it because it is a big decision and there's lots of consequences.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:20.940]   And if you can save 10 or 20% on college these days, it adds up.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.180]   And ultimately, you want to get somewhere.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:30.660]   I always, again, if you could talk about a vacation again, the way college was done in
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.060]   the past was kind of like on a vacation analogy, that would be, "All right, well, guess what,
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.060]   Josh?
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.740]   We've got this week off.
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.300]   So I guess we're on vacation.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.140]   So let's figure out where we're going to go.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.180]   Let's go down to the airport and pick a destination.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.140]   And then when we get there, we'll see if we can find a place to live and then we'll see
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.060]   if there's something fun to do."
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.740]   Most people don't do it that way for vacation because they've got limited time and resources
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.500]   and they want to make the most of it.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.580]   But that's how college used to work, right?
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:06.020]   You'd say sometime in your senior year of high school, "I think I want to go to college."
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.440]   You visit one or two of the local schools, you pick one, you sign up and you just kind
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.820]   of stumble your way through it, which worked for our parents and grandparents.
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.580]   But as we get into it today, we need to do more, in my opinion, again, because it's so
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:31.040]   expensive and you quite literally can lose tens of thousands of dollars because you made
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.180]   a mistake that you weren't aware of when it comes to things like financial aid, choosing
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.100]   the right loan, choosing the right school, or choosing not to go to begin with.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.300]   All those types of things can have a huge impact.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.100]   I'm not convinced that college costs are actually increasing and I'll explain why and I'd love
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.140]   it if you could convince me one way or the other.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.000]   The top line number does seem to steadily increase.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.060]   It's very difficult to argue with that just given the simple data that you cited.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:09.300]   However, the actual bottom line number, I can't figure out a way to actually calculate
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.180]   that because the top line number includes, if Harvard is, what do you say, $70,000 a
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.940]   year, they're including room, board, books, everything in that number.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.540]   But room and board are highly variable depending on where you live.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.060]   Also living on campus and using the college campus room and board is generally a more
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:33.700]   expensive way to live than can be accomplished through other means and mechanisms.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:39.140]   Some of the colleges that have the highest upfront cost or the highest top line number
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:45.740]   also have the most generous student aid programs, the most generous grant programs.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.300]   Plus you have to look at the various scholarship programs, et cetera.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:55.580]   If I wanted to – and if you look at the options, it's never been cheaper.
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.700]   I look at local community college options.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.260]   It's never been cheaper.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.100]   Even if you want to go through the official state college, it's never been cheaper to
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:12.500]   get tuition credits at a local community college if you're just focusing on tuition credits.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.460]   So is there a way or have you been able to pull out the data and figure out what the
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:24.020]   actual increase rate is versus just the top line number that's so easily studied?
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.980]   Are you aware of any data that pulls those numbers apart a little bit?
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.980]   Absolutely.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.540]   The national database, I actually just did this.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:41.220]   I pulled all the net price by income for Wisconsin colleges.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.500]   Obviously people that are listening are all over the country, but I live here in Wisconsin
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.100]   and work with a lot of Wisconsin families, so I chose to do that.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.100]   You're right.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.340]   The top line is going up a lot faster than the net line because at a lot of schools,
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.400]   they're offering scholarships.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.340]   So what's happened at a typical private school, let's say they raised their price in the
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:09.580]   last few years from $45,000 to $50,000, they may have also increased their aid by $5,000
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.420]   as well.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.820]   But the challenge is that $5,000 of aid, they get to choose who gets it and who doesn't.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.140]   So for the students they want, they'll still offer it.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:25.980]   For students that they will accept but they aren't really chasing, that's where the rub
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.340]   comes in.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:32.340]   So I have a lot of families that are looking at colleges and they're saying, "Well, I want
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.340]   to stretch.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:40.740]   I can just barely get accepted at the name-brand school, say Notre Dame.
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.740]   But if I get there, I'll probably have to pay full price because I'm just an average
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:51.500]   student in Notre Dame and their aid is reserved for the top students."
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.720]   That same student could then say, "Well, I could be an above average or a top student
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.780]   at a 'lesser school'."
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.780]   And I don't like the word.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.980]   I mean, there is no good school, bad school.
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.740]   This one's better than that one per se.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.400]   I mean, that's a long drawn-out argument.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.260]   But anyway, just as part of the story here, you could choose a school where you're a stronger
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:20.700]   student relative to the average class and go to maybe a more local private school and
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.240]   get a $10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000 scholarship.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.260]   And then, of course, if you really shop around, you might find a school where you're a rock
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.260]   star, right?
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:37.820]   Where this school over here has relatively low cost and offers very generous scholarships
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.020]   for top students and you're a really strong student at that type of school.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.860]   But again, it doesn't have the name recognition.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.300]   It's not a top-tier school.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.720]   There's many students and parents who essentially say, "Well, we've worked too hard to consider
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:56.080]   going to the 'no-name school' just because it's very low cost.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.260]   We'd rather spend the money and go to Notre Dame or whatever that college might be."
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.440]   Which is fine if you have it.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:08.160]   But if you don't have it, then the question becomes, should we borrow it?
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.320]   Are we going to put ourselves in that much financial jeopardy just to get to Notre Dame?
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.480]   Or is another path a reasonable path for our student?
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.880]   Well, get to the planning question.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.880]   I want to spend some time on that student loan question in a minute.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.200]   Before we do that, let's continue on this theme of name-brand schools versus non-name
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.280]   brand.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:38.320]   If I'm seeking to do an objective economic analysis, meaning I don't care that my dad
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.720]   went to this school or that I'm a fan of this football team.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   I'm just interested in the nuts and bolts of the economic analysis.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:50.040]   And one of my primary goals for college is the income potential.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.480]   There are lots of people who don't fall into that.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.400]   They say, "Well, I'm trying to learn something else and earning potential and career potential
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.000]   is only one of the benefits of college."
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Got that.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.360]   Set that aside.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.400]   Are you aware of any objective data that would indicate to me a way that I could make the
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:14.600]   decision criteria between choosing an inexpensive, non-name recognized path versus a name brand
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   expensive path?
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.400]   Yeah, I don't know that that type of data.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.240]   They're working on that type of data.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.400]   But all that data is relatively useless because it's all averages, right?
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.560]   You look at, well, if 100 kids graduated from this school and did this and 100 kids graduated
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   from that school and did that, great.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.360]   But that doesn't really matter because you're not 100 kids.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.280]   You're one.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:48.520]   And I think it has a lot more to do with how your student applies themselves and the majors
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.520]   they choose and how hard they're willing to work.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   So there's obviously some data skewed at these high-end schools, as an example, because they
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.240]   only accept the best and brightest kids.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.080]   Well, you know, so is Harvard a good school or they just have the privilege of accepting
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.760]   only the best kids?
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.680]   And I think the second answer is true.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:16.560]   They accept the best kids, give them an average or maybe even an above average education.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.480]   And in the end, what they turn out is some very productive, you know, high earning potential
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.200]   type graduates.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.320]   But they got to take the cream of the crop.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.320]   And if you happen to be the cream of the crop, well, then you can maybe consider going that
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.680]   path or an alternate path.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.240]   But the cream of the crop, I think, is going to do well whether they go to Harvard or the
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:43.720]   local state school or no college at all, potentially, because they have what it takes to get out
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.680]   there and do it, whether it's with formal education, informal education, on the job
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.480]   training, owning a business, all the different things that, you know, tend to create wealth,
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.880]   I think are potentially just because of the way the student acts and behaves.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.880]   Right.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.000]   You face that and I appreciate your point about it's a big issue to me is that you have
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.600]   to deal with selection bias at every stage of this, whether it's at what type of student
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.280]   is here or I'm of the opinion that you face that even in terms of the earnings record.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.320]   What is the fact when you get to somebody earning a higher income amount on the average,
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:29.920]   is it because they learned something in college that allowed them to earn a higher income
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:35.960]   or is it because the college process was tailored to that type of person and they were the ones
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.760]   who were the kind of person who goes through and finishes things and does what they're
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.860]   supposed to do and that type of person has the skills to succeed and be more financially
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.160]   productive in the world of work than many other people.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.040]   It's challenging to get good data.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.120]   Same thing, another one that really bugs me when looking at the numbers, it's my understanding
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.840]   of student loan debt and the amount of people – the earnings record and things like that.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.720]   Many people when looking at it don't factor in the reality that – it's my understanding
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.200]   that about 40 percent of college students never graduate and so you don't just have
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.360]   to deal with what are the problems of student loan debt for those who graduate.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.120]   You got to deal with the fact that 40 percent of students don't graduate and so those
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.960]   – their stories are often filtered out of the data that you're looking at and you're
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.640]   only looking at the 60 percent who actually graduated and you're making advice and recommendations
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.160]   without factoring in the fact that almost half of the students never actually fulfilled
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   the requirements.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.040]   And thus, they may have student loans or may have spent a few years of their life without
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.720]   getting the benefit of actually having the degree.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.720]   Right.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   That's all true and that's where – again, when we're doing research as is college effective
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.280]   and what do you recommend.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.440]   But again, when you start using that broad stroke, there's all kinds of things.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.080]   As an example, what majors are available at that particular college?
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.560]   If it has an engineering school, guess what?
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.020]   They have a lot of graduates that go off and do well and make good money, especially right
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.600]   out of school because the average engineer starts substantially higher than the average
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.040]   social worker as an example.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.040]   Now that's all averages, okay?
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.600]   And it's kind of like saying, "Well, I'm going to be a musician."
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.640]   Well, are you going to be a starving artist musician or are you going to be a rock star
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.640]   musician?
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:26.240]   And there's a very drastic difference to the lifestyle, the income potential, etc.,
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.280]   etc.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:35.240]   And whether or not you can do it is based on the individual in my opinion most likely,
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.680]   not the college you attend.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:44.120]   Let's walk through two scenarios because one of the biggest values that I think you
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.200]   can bring to my audience is talking about the framework of the decision process.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.040]   So first, the scenario.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.120]   I come into your office.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.600]   I'm a young father.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.120]   My wife and I, we have two young children.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.160]   We both have college degrees and we're concerned about planning for college.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.960]   That's the extent of the data you have on this case.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.960]   But I have a one-year-old and a two-and-a-half-year-old.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.320]   And I'm sitting and saying, "Brad, I want to plan for my kid's college."
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.880]   Walk me through the framework that you use to give clients good advice with regard to
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.880]   what to do.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   Brad O'Reilly Right.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.720]   Well, you actually – and I happened to listen to a show that you created where you talked
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.880]   about it and I think you and I are on the same page in that if you're young and starting
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:32.280]   out, if you're maxing your Roth IRAs, maxing your retirement plans at work, and you have
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.960]   extra money that you want to save for college, knock yourself out.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.520]   For everybody else, get your own financial house in order.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:48.680]   Do the best you can so that when you get to college 10 or 15 years from now, and theoretically
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.320]   your earning potential is high at that time, right?
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.120]   You've had a couple of promotions at work.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.280]   Your small business is now not quite so small, whatever it might be, and theoretically you've
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.960]   got more to work with.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.000]   At that time, you can make some decisions as to how much you might want to commit to
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.400]   college.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.840]   And if you're thinking, "I'm probably going to want to pay for college," well then bake
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.680]   that into your plan, but not necessarily a specific investment.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:22.960]   So if I know, if my wife and I agree or your wife and you agree that, "Hey, I'm going to
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.200]   contribute quite a bit to college.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.960]   I want to be there to help," that's fine.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.400]   Then when you're making your car buying decisions, don't spend so much money on cars.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.200]   When you're making your housing decision, don't spend so much on a house so that you
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.280]   have more free cash flow over your lifetime.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:47.000]   And then you can tap the college out of your net worth as it makes sense when you get there.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.480]   But it's really hard to plan for a one and a three-year-old because I think the system
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.480]   is going to change between now and then.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.120]   I don't know how.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:04.680]   So to base your decisions now on what we have now is probably not very useful.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.720]   On the other hand, if you just say, "Well, we're going to grow our net worth.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.320]   We're going to have, by the time we roll around to college, we're going to have $400,000 in
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.120]   our 401ks and we're going to have $200,000 in our Roth IRAs.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.080]   And we're going to have $100,000 in investments.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.560]   And our house is going to be half paid off and all our cars are paid for.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.660]   And we'll have an extra $2,000 a month coming in that we don't know what to do with.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.120]   And if we choose to spend it on college, we can."
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.220]   Well, you're in a great position.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:38.240]   Then when you come to me with a high school sophomore or junior, we've got things to work
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.200]   with and we can make it work.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.600]   Where I see what you want to avoid is the opposite of that plan, which is you learn
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.800]   how to spend everything you earn, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.080]   And I see these people all the time.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:58.480]   They're earning $100,000, $150,000 a year, which disqualifies them from most aid.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.520]   Yet they need that $150,000 to cover all their lifestyle.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.880]   The kids are doing dance.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.680]   The kids are in sports.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.880]   We take family vacations that are expensive.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.880]   We've got nice cars.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.000]   We've got a nice home.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.080]   We've got credit card debt.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.640]   And our budget is such that we need to earn what we earn just to cover our budget.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.840]   And now you want to put college on top of it?
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.080]   There's no way.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.680]   Well, guess what?
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.880]   I've seen families earning $75,000 easily cover college.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:33.520]   And I've seen families earning $150,000 just crumble under the pressure of college.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.600]   And it has nothing to do with who qualifies for aid.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:41.760]   It has everything to do with what their financial mindset was as they moved into the college
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.760]   years.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.000]   It has to do with how they prepared.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.240]   And again, not necessarily having a specific college fund set aside, but having the cars
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:58.920]   paid off and having some free cash flow to be able to do what you need if you choose
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.920]   to do it.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.080]   And then of course I have parents that are across the gamut as to whether they want to
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.080]   do it.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.080]   Some parents say, "College isn't my problem."
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.520]   Other parents say, "We're paying for it all."
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.120]   There's no right or wrong there.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.720]   But if you say you want to pay for it all, realize it could potentially be expensive
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.640]   and you need to plan accordingly as you're raising your kids.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.480]   Another big one would be that private school, private high school, as an example.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.320]   I've had families say, "Well, we spent all our money on private high school instead of
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.340]   college, because we thought that was a, you know, and now he's going to go win a bunch
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.280]   of scholarships and ta-da, college is paid for."
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.840]   It's like, yeah, maybe, but there's a whole lot of kids that go to private schools that
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.400]   aren't in any better position than kids that went to public schools.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:55.980]   Could you think of the scenario in which, so obviously we're in agreement on that, and
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:02.200]   to me when looked at that way, that plan of paying for kids' schooling by attending to
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:10.000]   everything else brings so much more flexibility for a future that's very uncertain, especially
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.200]   for younger kids.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.480]   I understand if you have a 12-year-old who's seemingly very interested in engineering and
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.840]   you come from a background of MIT and you say, "Well, MIT is interested in them.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.840]   They're working on that."
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.960]   I get the planning at that point.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.320]   But for many young families, which seems to be the situation where you get the question
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.080]   as a financial advisor, you get the question, "Hey, what do I do for my one-year-old?
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.400]   I want to go ahead and open a college account for them."
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.840]   I just think the plan that you laid out there and that I've discussed elsewhere is so much
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.360]   more flexible.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.120]   But let's contrast that.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.360]   Could you design a scenario in which you would, or what would be the scenario in which you
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.540]   would actually say, "No, a college savings plan is the way to go.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.920]   What you should definitely do is go and open and fund a college account of some kind."
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.040]   What would be the scenarios, what would be the facts that would lead you in that direction
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.560]   of advice?
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.480]   Being relatively financially sound in retirement, et cetera.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:16.720]   So again, I have some young professionals where they just got married and they're both
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:23.000]   earning 80,000 each or high six figures or whatever it might be, where all of a sudden
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.520]   they take their two households and they merge them and they go, "Man, we've got 4,000 a
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.640]   month that we used to have two rents and car payments and all that stuff and that's all
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   gone.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640]   We've got 4,000 a month.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.640]   What do we do with this?
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.440]   And we're already doing well in our retirement.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:44.080]   Well, by all means, go ahead, put some of that into college."
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.320]   I deal a lot with parents of high school students.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.720]   So I have a lot of parents come to me with 25,000 or 50,000 in a 529.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.280]   And I've got some that come to me and say, "Well, 100,000 in 529s."
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.880]   And they're also the ones that are saying, "By the way, I plan on sending both kids to
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.960]   high end school.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.160]   So yes, 100,000 is a good start, but I need to come up with another 300,000 to make it
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160]   all work."
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.040]   So let's jump to that scenario because that was going to be the next scenario I was going
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.040]   to present.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.720]   I'm now the parent of a couple of high school students.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.760]   Both of them seem appropriately qualified for college.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:25.200]   It seems like college would be an appropriate decision for them of some sort or another.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.000]   What's your decision framework for giving advice in that circumstance?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.840]   Pretend I've got $25,000 in a college savings plan and it's not enough.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.280]   Now you're trying to give me some advice.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.080]   How do I approach that?
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.080]   Right.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:44.400]   So what I recommend people do is they lay out their other goals and say, "Are we on
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.400]   track for those?"
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.440]   So a typical family that I see, they've got two goals.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.760]   Figure out college, work a few more years, and retire.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.320]   That is a very typical.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.120]   And then, you know, we'd like to have some family vacations, but they're not as critical.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.680]   We'd like to do some other things, buy a boat, place up north, whatever it might be.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:13.520]   Might be, you know, I wish I could, but that's, you know, that's, we'll drop that in a heartbeat
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.940]   to get these two goals done.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.880]   So that's the typical family.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.640]   And again, if you've done your planning well and you've already, you know, you've got that
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:28.840]   half million tucked away in your 401k or million or whatever it needs to be, and you're sitting
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.520]   pretty good, I've done an analysis quite often where we say, "You know what?
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.560]   In order for you to be able to retire, you need to continue to save about 10 or 15% into
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.040]   your 401k, which you've been doing all along.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.480]   And that works great.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.600]   And you're on track.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:52.360]   Now if you want to pay for all of college, we need another 1500 a month."
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.000]   And the parents look at each other and say, "Yeah, I just started a new job.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.720]   I got a raise that covers that."
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.720]   Done, right?
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.560]   Now, it's just a matter of, we've got it.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.720]   How do we do it efficiently?
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:08.640]   Should we use saving, you know, 529s or Coverdells or Roth IRAs?
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.360]   How are we going to, you know, let me get into the details.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.800]   And doing that planning is important as well.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.000]   But for the typical family that I'm seeing, I'm telling them things like, "Well, you need
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.120]   1000 a month to make this work, or you need 1500 a month to make this work."
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:30.240]   You're at the high end and sometimes maybe it's, well, what you want to do is 500 a month.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:36.120]   And if you can do your other goals and hit that nut, and again, it really boils down
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.800]   for most families is they say, "We're here.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.240]   College is important."
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.320]   And I have to say things, "Well, is college as important as that $10,000 a year you spend
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.320]   on family vacations?"
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.320]   "Oh, college is much more important."
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.560]   "Okay, are you willing to stop the vacations?"
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.080]   "Well, yeah, probably.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.920]   The kids are grown and gone and they're off doing their own things.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:59.840]   So you know, a big family vacation is a thing of the past anyway, or it becomes a family
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.400]   camping trip or whatever."
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:08.280]   But yeah, from that standpoint, I think a lot of families, you know, I have a lot of
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.280]   examples.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.880]   I think about the other day, I had a dad in my office, four kids.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:21.440]   His oldest is a performing artist, wanted to get into New York, got accepted to NYU,
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.440]   did great, got lots of great scholarships.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.640]   So the net cost for college was about $35,000.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:33.720]   Now dad is looking at that and saying, "Well, $35,000 times four years, that's $140,000
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.020]   times four kids.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.980]   That's a big number."
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.440]   And then we started talking about, "Well, if you do it for one, does that by definition
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.200]   mean you're doing it for all?"
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.560]   I mean, some parents say, "Well, we'll teach their own if they need more or less, that
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.400]   you know, we're not going to, doesn't have to be equal as far as dollar amounts."
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.000]   You know, we're going to, our idea of fair is different than that, and which is fine.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.760]   You do it however you want, but it's got to be part of the plan.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.680]   How are you going to be fair or do you even care if you're fair?
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.480]   You know, I've had parents say, "Well, this kid earned it.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   They've worked hard.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.000]   This kid has never tried, never worked hard.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.720]   You know, I don't care that they don't get as much as the one that has been going, you
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.000]   know, working hard at it."
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.920]   But that's again, kind of the scenario we're looking at is now in dad's situation, he was
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:31.240]   doing well at work and we were able to squeeze a couple thousand a month and with loans and
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.560]   everything and his current savings and investing, we could make the plan work.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.040]   It would probably delay his retirement by three years.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:45.240]   And he was good with that because it was within what he was willing to do to make it all happen.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:51.640]   How would you decide, if I come up short for college, how would you decide if student loans
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.020]   are a good idea?
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.560]   And if we decide the student loans are a good idea, how would we decide whether it should
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.120]   be the parent borrowing money or the child borrowing money?
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   Right.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   All right.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:08.800]   So, and again, the families I'm working with are typically not qualifying for a lot of
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.660]   aid, although they do get some sometimes.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:17.900]   But families need to realize that the student can typically only borrow 5,500 under the
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.340]   direct loan as a freshman.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.980]   Any borrowing after that, mom and dad are involved.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:28.100]   So these kids that are quote unquote graduating with hundreds of thousands of debt or a hundred
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:34.960]   thousand of debt, that was facilitated by parents or it was grad school or some of those
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.900]   types of things could cause that as well.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.520]   You know, becoming a doctor or MBA, that type of thing is.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:48.440]   But a typical undergrad can only borrow about $30,000 all in over four years.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:54.440]   So anything beyond that, mom or dad has co-signed a loan or somebody has co-signed a loan, which
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:00.000]   in the private industry, private loans, or mom or dad have taken out a plus loan from
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.400]   the federal government.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.040]   Or mom and dad are the bank somehow.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.520]   They choose to take their own assets and lend them to the student or they choose to pay
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:15.560]   for college or mom and dad borrow the money on a home equity or from their 401k, which
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.560]   I'm not recommending.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.720]   But somehow mom and dad raise the money provided to the student.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.380]   And then mom and dad can say, here's the money you're going to pay us back.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.360]   You can say, here's the money you're going to pay us back.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.320]   Here's a contract to sign.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.320]   Here's the money.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.560]   We hope you pay it back, but we probably will never see it.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:40.280]   You know, that's kind of the family dynamic that's often challenging.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.520]   So that the reality of it is, is choosing the right loan.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.520]   Kind of two questions.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.720]   Are you trying to save the family money or the parents money as an example?
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:57.320]   So parents might be able to borrow on a home equity for three or 4%, which is a really
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.640]   good rate.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.880]   However, that loan is now in the parent's name and they're responsible.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:10.840]   Whereas if they co-sign a loan, maybe it's at 4% variable and likely to go up.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.280]   But that interest is paid by the student.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.520]   The loan is in the student's name and it's only going to cost the parents something if
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:24.640]   the student defaults and the parents have to step in and clean up the mess.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.520]   So again, you look at it and say, well, I don't care if my student pays 12% for this
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.680]   loan because they're paying it.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.320]   It doesn't cost me a penny.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.440]   Now most parents are going to look at that and say that, you know, we want to protect
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.620]   our family and if that's what it's going to take, maybe we will consider using the home
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:47.680]   equity or some other way to get the cost down where they can.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:53.400]   So that, I guess, is part of the process is who's going to pay the interest and are we
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.720]   worried about the family as a whole or are we worried about mom and dad's costs versus
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.840]   the student's costs?
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.160]   You wrote an article on your blog that I thought was excellent.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.120]   It was the top 10 college planning mistakes.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:13.520]   And about five of these I want to talk about for a moment with you because they're specifically
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.200]   financial and I think there are some interesting little radical strategies contained therein
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.920]   that my audience will benefit from.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:28.560]   So your number one mistake that you listed was to assume that you won't qualify for need-based
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.560]   aid.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.360]   Your point was that it's hard to know in advance whether you'll qualify for need-based aid.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:39.960]   You've seen families with a high income qualify, as high as $250,000 qualify.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:43.720]   But you've seen families earning $75,000 not qualify.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:49.480]   And so you need to test it out with actual calculations.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.320]   That one's relatively simple.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.520]   But in your number two, you said the biggest second biggest mistake, starting your planning
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.280]   too late or not at all.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:06.240]   And you point out that the base year for financial aid calculations starts in the middle of the
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.020]   junior year of high school.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.080]   And so there might be things that you need to do in sophomore or early junior year before
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.240]   that base year starts.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.760]   Talk about the base year and why that date is important.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:24.440]   So the base year is the year that they use, and it's the tax year that they use to calculate
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.420]   how much aid you're going to qualify for.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.280]   So that base year, you want to behave.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.600]   So you don't want to do anything that would artificially inflate your income.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:41.360]   And that would be things like selling assets at capital gains or selling a rental property
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:50.080]   or taking bonuses at work or exercising stock options, adjusting what you put into your
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.920]   401(k) could have an impact depending on the type of investment.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:35:00.520]   So there's things that cause your income to go up or down, and you want to do that consciously.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.480]   Now another important thing to realize is since that article has been written, they
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.000]   actually change when the base year is.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.440]   They have what's called the new prior prior rules.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.720]   So that means a typical family, the tax year that they're going to use for your first year
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.240]   of college starts in the middle of your sophomore year of high school and goes through the middle
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.000]   of your junior year of high school.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.120]   So that's so as an example, if you have a student starting college in 2017, so they're
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:37.360]   a rising senior, you're going to be filling out financial aid using 2015 taxes.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.980]   So it looks back a long ways.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:46.680]   So now it's even more challenging that you do what you need to do in order to make it
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.680]   work out.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:55.240]   So the idea here, because I see some potential for a segment of my audience with this knowledge,
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.360]   and it does get complicated with the fact that you're saying two years.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:06.600]   The idea is in this year, if we can lower our income to the maximum amount that's tenable,
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:13.120]   we will look on paper as though we are more needy and this will help the need-based financial
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.400]   aid calculations to come out in our favor.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:22.200]   This could be a substantially high benefit if you just calculate – let's say you're
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.680]   going to get a need payment of $20,000 per year over four years.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.040]   This could be a very high offsetting amount.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.940]   So a couple of questions to clarify.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:38.640]   This prior, prior year, are these calculations done one time or are they done each year while
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.240]   the student is going through college?
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.080]   Yeah, they're done each year, so they continue to look back.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.320]   So the first year would be that tax year.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.800]   So again, if you have the senior, they're going to be using 2015 taxes.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.480]   But in the next year, you're going to do it all over again using 2016 taxes and then 2017
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.400]   and then 2018.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:05.600]   But a big advantage to that now is you'll use your 2018 taxes to calculate aid for your
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   senior.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.280]   So 2019 taxes will never be seen, assuming you don't have other students and they're
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.880]   going to graduate in four years.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.120]   But 2019, now the colleges are never going to see.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.160]   And in 2019, your student is still only a sophomore or junior.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.520]   So in that year, that would be the year where you could blow things up, where you don't
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.520]   see anything.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.720]   So that's the year that grandma gives you money.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.640]   That's the year that you exercise some stock options.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:37.600]   That's the year that, you know, that you can increase your income, have it available for
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.720]   college, but it's not going to show up on any forms because you're not ever going to
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.400]   have to fill out financial aid again.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:52.000]   And these, the data here, we're talking about the data that's going to go on the FAFSA.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Is that correct?
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   That's correct.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And/or the CSS profile.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.080]   So there's two financial aid forms out there.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   Okay.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.640]   The FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, and then CSS.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.040]   Does that have an acronym that I should know?
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   It does.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.040]   It's like IBM.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   I don't remember what it is.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.400]   It's a company, college something, data service or something like that.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.080]   Now, what is counted as income?
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.500]   Is it using the adjusted gross income number from the tax return?
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.500]   What is it counting?
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.500]   All right.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.120]   Well, now we're getting into some technicalities.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.920]   So the FAFSA looks at your adjusted gross income, which is the bottom of the first page
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:31.520]   of a typical 1040, and then they add back in certain types of untaxed income.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.480]   So they would add back in, as an example, contributions to 401(k)s.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:41.760]   So if you've got a family earning $50,000 a year and they choose to put 10,000 in their
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.880]   401(k), it's not going to help them when it comes to aid because what they do is that
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   the government says, "Well, what's your AGI?"
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.720]   And it's going to be 40 because of the contributions.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.960]   But then you say, "But what did you contribute to 401(k)?"
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.600]   That you're going to say 10,000, and they're going to add it back in.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.920]   So you're right back to 50 where you were.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:08.280]   So contributing to retirement doesn't help or hurt you when it comes to aid for the typical
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   family.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.320]   But they do add that back in.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.040]   The other things they would add back in are things like child support that often families
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.760]   receive tax-free because the other parent pays the taxes, and things like investment
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.600]   income that's tax-free, like municipal bonds, disability payments, a few things like that.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.200]   So they try and capture all your income, whether it's taxed or not.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.760]   And then they also look at the assets of the family.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.760]   So let's come to assets in a moment.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:41.000]   But as far as income, so if I wanted to skirt this, and it's hard when you get into multiple
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.640]   kids because we're talking about a planning scenario where you're trying to reduce your
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:49.800]   income on paper for multiple years while your student is in college.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:54.320]   And if you have multiple kids, this could be just not practical.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.640]   But it's kind of a fun thought experiment.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:03.440]   So the first thing that occurs to me is, number one, if I'm a radical personal finance hardcore
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:09.480]   person who's saving a lot, and if I've got plans for, say, a mini retirement, then it
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:14.160]   would be really good to line up my mini retirement with these years that these financial aid
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:19.240]   calculations are going to be done if college is important to me, just to naturally reduce
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.560]   the income.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.160]   And that would be the time to plan that round-the-world sailing adventure, or whatever the appropriate
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.480]   version is for your life.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.760]   As far as income that's not countable, the big one that stands out to me is debt.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:38.000]   If I can structure debt income and pay my bills from debt, whether that's, say, a real
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.720]   estate transaction, refinancing a mortgage, something like that, then that will not be
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.880]   reflected under my AGI number.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:52.960]   But yet, taking out debt is still money that I could use to pay my bills and fund my lifestyle.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.120]   Can you think of any other creative strategies that we could use to still be able to fund
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:01.600]   our life without having it reflected there on that FAFSA AGI number?
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   Right.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.080]   Well, I mean, you can just use your assets, too.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:09.840]   If you have built up $20,000 in the bank, and then you're just going to bleed that down
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.320]   instead of having income.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:19.060]   So yeah, a lot of small business owners and people that have control over their tax forms
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:24.680]   and their income can do some things that are relatively creative.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:29.360]   So I've seen small business owners buy a lot of equipment and drive their income down.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.260]   You know, so another recommendation in your situation is to pick the years where you have
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.960]   two kids in college and say, "Well, those years, I'll get double the benefit for having
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.960]   low income.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.400]   So those are the years I'm going to focus on."
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:49.080]   And maybe use the other times to spend whatever else is going to count or whatever it might
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   be.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:55.120]   So that would be another tactic that we use a lot is a lot of times with one kid in school,
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.200]   it's not going to make much difference if you do your financial aid planning.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.560]   But if when you have two or three in school, that's the year you really want to focus on
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.880]   because you're going to put that number on three different financial aid forms and you
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.120]   could potentially get benefit three times.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.520]   Now you said the FAFSA is different than the CSS.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.800]   Right.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.520]   So the CSS profile is operated by the more prestigious schools.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.360]   As the government makes the FAFSA easier to complete and they make, you know, there's
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.200]   less data on it and it's just getting easier and easier.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:33.760]   The colleges that hand out substantial scholarships want more information to verify that if they're
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:39.040]   going to give you, you know, 30,000 a year times four years in scholarships, that you
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.500]   in fact deserve it from a financial standpoint.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:51.360]   So you know, things like your real estate are not on your FAFSA.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.080]   Small businesses under 100 employees don't show up on the FAFSA.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.200]   A number of things like that.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.840]   Whereas the CSS profile asks about all those things and it asks about your retirement plans
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:08.080]   and they want to know if you've got a 50 million dollar IRA, which you would never show up
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.600]   on a on the FAFSA.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.800]   Whether or not they would count it against you is a different question, but they at least
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.120]   want complete data.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:20.800]   So they can choose on a subjective basis how they're going to count the assets?
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   Well the FAFSA...
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   On the CSS, I mean.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.760]   Yeah, the FAFSA has federal rules, federal guidelines.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.620]   They have to do it the way they want, the way the government says it has to be done.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:34.640]   When it comes to Harvard offering aid, they can do whatever they want.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.640]   It's their money.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.040]   They can say, "I like you."
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:42.120]   And as long as they're not discrimination with the official discrimination rules, you
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.320]   know, they can say, "We like redheads."
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:48.240]   And since redheads is not a protected class and they say, "I give a thousand dollars to
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.680]   every redhead," that's fine.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.040]   I mean, they can't, again, minority status and disability and those types of things,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.400]   they can't break those laws, but they can do it however they want.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.640]   I mean, it's their money.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:05.760]   And now from a practical standpoint, although they can do it however they want, they want
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.160]   to make it look like at least that they're, as they're handing out the money, they're
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.320]   doing using some sort of system.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.720]   They don't just want it willy-nilly because then that gets to be the political problem
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.280]   of, "Well, you know, this guy got more than I got and it's not fair and you're discriminating."
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:27.840]   And, you know, from a long-term viability, they don't want to get into the, like they're
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.040]   selling used cars and some of those types of things as well.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:37.720]   So, the other planning idea, and I want to see if it would be invalidated on the CSS,
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:43.360]   the other planning idea of the way that you decrease your income in order to get aid is
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:48.040]   to focus on building a capital asset during the years that you need a low income.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:52.720]   And so that could be as simple as somebody who's handy moving into a fixer-upper, they
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:59.400]   buy it cheap and they spend their time increasing the value of that asset by working on it during
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.520]   the years that they, or year that they need to show a lower income.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.960]   That increase in the value of the capital asset is not going to be reflected on an income
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.060]   number or this would be a good time where you're going to start your business.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.360]   And so your business has a very low value in the beginning, but you're pouring yourself
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:19.400]   in to building it as a capital asset, thus you're having a low income.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:26.680]   So what you're saying though is that capital assets are more capturable by the CSS data
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:27.960]   than by the FAFSA.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.960]   Is that accurate?
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   Yes.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:30.960]   Okay.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.780]   That is in general accurate.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:41.320]   Even on the, both the FAFSA and the CSS profile would count anything beyond your primary residence.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.920]   So if you had a rental property or apartment buildings and that kind of stuff, that would
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.280]   be the net value of that would be applicable.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:51.600]   How is the primary residence counted on these forms?
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:57.400]   So the primary residence for FAFSA is not included at all.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.640]   They don't care about the value.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.640]   They don't care about the debt.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.040]   They don't care about the big mortgage payment.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.040]   They don't care about the equity.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.920]   So none of that shows up.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.120]   Whereas on the CSS profile, you report it all.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.120]   They want to know what you paid for it when you bought it, what it's worth now, how much
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.040]   do you owe on it.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:16.000]   Now what the colleges do with that data is a case by case basis.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.160]   Some colleges say we're just going to count it as an asset, the net value of your real
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.160]   estate.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:25.840]   Others, you know, especially that California colleges where there's people that are sitting
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:31.040]   on tiny little homes worth a million and a half and they can't borrow that money because
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.640]   they can't afford the repayments on it.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:38.240]   I mean, they have this huge asset, but they can't tap it in any way.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.880]   So some of the California schools will say, well, we'll limit your, you know, that asset
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.060]   to two times your income.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.840]   So if you're only earning 75,000, but you happen to have that paid off house that you
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:55.320]   bought 50 years ago or 30 years ago, and it was in a great neighborhood and you got lucky,
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.440]   we're not going to count it against you up, you know, except for up to two times your
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.800]   income.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.040]   Other colleges, they count the whole thing.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.840]   And so, and that's a case by case.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:11.240]   Again, with the CSS profile, you fill out the data and the colleges use the data however
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.240]   they want.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.560]   And they typically would use some sort of formula, but some colleges, you know, around
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.960]   the edges, they all do it similar.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.560]   But you know, some will include your home equity, some won't.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:25.540]   Some will do this with your business, some will do that with your business.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:31.760]   And what they actually do is not even published or, you know, not knowledge necessarily.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.600]   They don't have to disclose how they came up with their calculations.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.640]   But the CSS is only used by higher end schools, you said.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   Right.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.920]   There's about 300 colleges, the name brand schools, you know, the Harvard and Yale's
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.600]   and Stanford and Notre Dame and Harvey Mudd and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:52.760]   So if someone were trying to plan for, say, state school, you know, local, well regarded
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:58.500]   state school that's strong in their area, probably the CSS wouldn't be reflective.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:04.060]   So they could use some of these planning ideas in order to generate a higher amount of federal
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.060]   aid credits.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.060]   Correct.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.060]   That's great.
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.060]   Yes.
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.060]   I like it.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.100]   Next one on your list, number three, biggest mistake is putting assets or savings in the
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.100]   student's name.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.940]   So explain here how people get this one wrong.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:17.940]   Right.
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:22.140]   So as I mentioned, financial aid in general, there's five major factors.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:28.420]   It's income and assets of mom and dad, income and assets of the student, and the number
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.420]   of students that the parents are supporting.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.060]   And this is all predicated on the typical 18 year old going off to college after high
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.060]   school.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.940]   If you're a returning student or, you know, 40 year old returning or whatever, the rules
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.180]   are different.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:47.280]   But for the typical parent dealing with a 18 year old student, those are the five factors
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.380]   that have the biggest impact.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:54.300]   Now a lot of times the student assets are zero and the student income is zero or nearly
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.340]   enough that it doesn't really have much of an impact.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:00.940]   So now you're really dealing with mom and dad's income and assets and the number of
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:01.940]   students.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:08.620]   And then occasionally parents over the years have put assets in the student's name.
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:12.100]   In the past it was done for tax benefits, but those benefits have gone away, but we
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.460]   still see the accounts out there.
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:19.340]   So it's called an UGMA or an UTMA account would be typical or maybe a bank account with
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:24.120]   the student's name or the student gets an inheritance from grandma or grandpa or something
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.180]   where they now have substantial assets in their name.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:35.580]   In any of those cases, they assess student assets much more heavily than parent assets.
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:40.780]   So parent assets are assessed on a sliding scale up to about five and a half percent.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:45.660]   So if you have a hundred thousand dollars in the parent's name, the biggest impact it'll
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:50.640]   have is 5,500 reduction in aid.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:55.020]   If you had that same hundred thousand dollars in the student's name, it's assessed at 20%.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.780]   So that's going to have a $20,000 swing in aid.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:03.040]   So that's a $15,000 difference.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.360]   So if you can, you get that student asset to zero.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:11.780]   So depending on what it is and how it's structured, you know, if it's parents putting money into
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:17.020]   the student's name on purpose, we'll stop it and reverse it.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:21.140]   Start using that money for student expenses and other things.
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:29.980]   I had a grandmother pass away and leave the student about $250,000.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:35.740]   That student was accepted at Northwestern and mom's single and earning a decent living,
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:42.600]   but it's 65,000, something like that, but not great by any means.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.800]   And because he was accepted at Northwestern, which will help that school meets a hundred
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   percent of your needs.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.480]   So if you demonstrate need, they've got a scholarship for you.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:57.560]   Well, because of that $250,000 in a trust, he's the beneficiary labeled for college,
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.560]   essentially.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.680]   We had to report it and he essentially got zero aid.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.720]   He spent $250,000 of his inheritance on college.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.360]   Could he have disclaimed it?
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.120]   Perhaps, I don't know if there was a contingent or where it would have gone.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.280]   I wonder where it would have gone.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.280]   But that was heartbreaking.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.200]   Yes, that's water under the bridge.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.040]   Had that money been in mom's name, it still would have counted against us.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.960]   But because of the difference in the formulas, he might have been eligible for $10,000 or
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:32.160]   $20,000 in scholarships each year.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.760]   So I mean, you spend half of it instead of all of it.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:41.320]   Are there some assets that are generally not reflected on, that some people have that are
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:45.360]   generally not reflected either for the student or for the parent?
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.360]   Yes.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.000]   So not all assets are counted against you.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   And the major categories that do not count would be, and we've already talked about home
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   and home equity.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.060]   So that's out on the FAFSA, maybe on the CSS, just depending.
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:02.920]   But also in general, most colleges will not count retirement against you.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:07.320]   So your 401(k)s, IRAs, Roth IRAs, pensions, profit sharing.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.000]   How about retirement accounts for the child?
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   Same thing.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   They're out.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.280]   Now, most students don't have it because you need to have earned income in order to have
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.680]   money in a retirement plan.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.840]   But yes, I have had.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:24.960]   That's a strategy that we use quite often, where if a student is working part time, their
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:31.560]   Roth IRA gets funded to the maximum that they can when we have extra cash flow.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:36.480]   So yes, so most retirement is out.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.240]   Another big category is small business.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.280]   We've already talked about that.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.600]   Small businesses generally don't count.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:46.660]   As long as there's less than 100 employees and more than 50% owned by the family.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:51.400]   So you can exclude, you know, the typical doctor's and dentist's office and the realtors
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:55.480]   and the small manufacturers and the restaurants and all those types of things.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:59.760]   So the entire business, the business investment accounts, all that stuff is out.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:05.800]   So anything that's part of the business, the working capital, etc.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:10.960]   Annuities and life insurance generally are out.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.280]   They're not considered an asset.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:20.040]   Now I'm sure you've had life insurance shows in the past, but there is, you know, on a
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:23.840]   side, there are life insurance agents out there that will sell you life insurance and
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.220]   tell you that's a great way to plan for college.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:30.340]   That strategy does work, but it works in very limited cases.
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:37.060]   I've, you know, I've helped about 180 families now directly plan and I've used life insurance
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.420]   three times, I think.
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:44.120]   I could never get the policies to, I could never get the return high enough on child
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:49.740]   policies to make it work and make sense from the perspective of using the life insurance
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:53.500]   policy as the funding vehicle.
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:59.740]   I always wound up, and I think they, I mean, I guess in theory it's possible and I never
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:04.340]   researched this to the extent where I could find it, but I heard that some life insurance
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:08.660]   companies were offering policies that were specifically designed for it.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.380]   But for whatever reason with the mortality tables, I could never get a life insurance
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:20.060]   policy to show enough return, you know, over even 18 years to make it worth it.
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:25.660]   But that didn't mean that the life, but where I went to in a few situations was to say,
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:31.140]   "Okay, consider the life insurance policy as a component, but plan it so the premiums
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.940]   disappear.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.020]   And if you're funding it heavily, just plan it so you don't have life insurance premiums
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:44.060]   during those years and then pay for the college out of earned income, pay the expenses out
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:45.280]   of earned income.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:49.660]   Then you've got some of the assets sheltered aside and you need more than 18 years for
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:54.940]   that asset to make it worth it, but you've hidden it to some degree on the financial
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:59.100]   aid forms and then you can make up the difference in cash flow."
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.740]   That was the best way that I could see to use them around that.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:06.380]   Do you have additional ideas surrounding using life insurance?
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:07.380]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:11.740]   So in general, where I've seen it work too is it has nothing to do with the child policies.
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.660]   The child policies almost never work that I've ever seen.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:21.140]   In my opinion, they're a complete waste of money because yes, it would be terrible if
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:29.700]   a child died, but economically there's no real good reason to have life insurance.
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:33.420]   Where I've seen it work is where we're putting quite literally hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:40.820]   into a large contract on mom or dad who already have a need for two million of insurance and
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.100]   we're sheltering huge sums.
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:46.820]   And then when you look at the fixed costs of a policy, a typical policy might have a
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:55.380]   hundred dollar policy fee and a $5 a month this and a $2 a month that, premium taxes.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:59.980]   So if you're spending a couple hundred or a couple thousand dollars in fees and you
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:05.420]   only have 10 or 15,000 in the policy, it eats the policy alive.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:09.000]   When you've got a half million and you're spending a couple thousand dollars, now you're
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.880]   spending a half a percent of the policy value and that's where I see it works.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:22.100]   But now you've got a major asset that you really need to understand and manage because
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.980]   it can blow up on you.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.860]   It's not as simple as a basic mutual fund portfolio or something like that.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:32.060]   You've got to make sure that you have the right types of insurance and you don't break
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:34.820]   the tax rules and all that kind of stuff.
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:40.320]   But again, for the high end estate planning or those types of things, that's where I've
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:46.440]   seen insurance work well is the bigger dollar amounts.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:50.200]   I'm going to put in $5,000 a year for the next 10 years.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.200]   Use a Roth IRA.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.200]   Right, right.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.200]   It's simpler.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.200]   Right.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.280]   It's simpler, it's cleaner, it doesn't have all the overhead expenses and then just buy
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.280]   some term insurance.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:04.540]   I do think, by the way, on life insurance, I think parents, especially if they're funding
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:09.560]   their children's college, I think parents should all buy a term insurance policy on
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:14.840]   their 18-year-olds of at least a couple hundred thousand, $100,000, $250,000, something like
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:20.360]   that in case their child dies during college or at an older age.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:24.940]   Setting aside the fact that most people have a difficult problem with that emotionally,
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:26.880]   do you agree with me on that piece of advice?
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:32.120]   Well, yeah, especially if you're cosigning loans, you need to understand what the loan
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.840]   provisions are.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:39.400]   I know federal loans typically are forgiven if the student dies and it's in the student's
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.400]   name.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:44.960]   So you don't have to worry about those loans.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:49.160]   And under disability, they're also forgiven potentially.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.560]   But it's the private loans, you have to read the contract and really understand, well,
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.960]   what happens at death and disability.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:58:01.560]   And you know, to that exact example, right, you have a student that graduates from college
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:06.720]   and one year into their life that after college, they get hit by a bus and now who pays back
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:12.480]   the loans that they're no longer earning money to pay back, etc., etc.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:16.680]   And yeah, you might want to get some and it would be very low cost on a young, healthy
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.680]   person.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.840]   Yeah, I mean a young male or female, 18 years old, a couple hundred thousand dollars, especially
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:27.040]   if you get something like annual renewable term and we're talking $150, $200 a year for
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.120]   a couple hundred thousand dollar contract.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.360]   I mean, it's pretty negligible.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:39.240]   By the way, Brad, do you ever feel bad for the bus drivers that are always hitting all
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.240]   these people?
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.240]   I don't know.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.440]   I guess I never thought of it that way.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:50.440]   I feel bad for bus drivers that we're always insulting their driving abilities, referring
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.080]   to all the people they're hitting with their buses.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.120]   Excuse me, I couldn't resist.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:01.200]   Next thing on your list, number four, we covered number four, which is increasing parent income
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.200]   in the base year.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.760]   We talked about that enough.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:09.400]   One point you made here that I think is important that when you're trying to adjust your income,
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:13.920]   you only want to adjust the income that you can adjust without the fear of losing it.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.040]   So when do you actually have constructive receipt of the asset?
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:21.800]   Sometimes there are ways if you control your own – and you can't do this when you have
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:26.640]   a salary, but if you have a business or you're timing a real estate transaction or something
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.400]   like that, those are the things you want to control.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:34.760]   You point out that if you're going to receive a $20,000 cash bonus, you just take the cash.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:38.360]   Much more value to have $20,000 in the bank than to give up five and a half percent of
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:41.480]   that as far as a student aid credit.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.880]   But I think that was a good point.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:43.880]   But let's go on number eight.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:48.240]   Well, let me just read number five, failing to plan for the cost of college, relatively
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.120]   self-explanatory that you need to actually plan with it.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:55.840]   Number six, overuse of college savings plans, getting too much money in there.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.960]   Number seven, missing financial aid deadlines.
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:03.680]   It can be very expensive to miss that.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.960]   Number eight is one of the other two that I want to focus on, which is neglecting your
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.080]   debts.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:14.320]   Your point here is consumer debts such as credit cards and car loans are not reported
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:19.300]   for financial aid, but bank accounts, savings accounts are counted against you.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:23.840]   So sometimes you might want to go ahead and reduce your assets by paying down your debts.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840]   Expand on this, please.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.720]   Yeah, and that's right.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:33.200]   I mean, they will count any asset, but they don't generally count any of your consumer
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.200]   debt.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:38.080]   So if a debt against a specific asset like a home, then you can net that out for like
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.080]   rental property.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.760]   But if you just have credit card debt or a boat loan or something, they don't count the
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:51.200]   boat as an asset and they don't count the debt as a negative towards your net worth
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.200]   either.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.160]   So what you may want to do, again, if you've got $100,000 sitting idly in the bank earning
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:02.760]   zero percent and if you pay off those loans, will you get more aid?
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.860]   If the answer is yes, then you go ahead and do it.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:11.100]   But all of this planning that we're talking about as a quick caveat here is generally
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.820]   you don't want to do something that doesn't make sense.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:18.060]   I mean, I can say this correctly.
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:23.420]   So if you're going to make a financial transaction and it makes sense for tax purposes or retirement
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:28.620]   or all those things, and it'll benefit you for college, great, go ahead and do it.
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:33.140]   If on the other hand, you're going to do some transactions with the sole goal of getting
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:38.060]   more aid, as an example, you need to make sure that after it's all done, that you in
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:40.220]   fact will deliver on that aid.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:45.060]   Because I've seen a lot of families where you can increase your eligibility for aid
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:49.980]   and not get any benefit or only get a loan that you didn't want anyway.
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:56.700]   So as an example, I've had families going to a state school, their EFC comes in at $15,000,
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.540]   so their actual financial aid...
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.300]   - EFC is their expected family contribution.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.300]   - Correct.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:05.660]   So their actual need or financial aid that they need is $10,000.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.740]   And a typical state school is going to say, "Yes, you need $10,000.
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:14.300]   Unfortunately, all we can offer you is that $5,500 loan that we've been talking about."
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.780]   Now you go through a bunch of hoops and you rearrange your assets and you increase your
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:23.500]   need from $10,000 to $15,000, you get the same answer from the school.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:29.220]   It's like, "Yes, you need $15,000, but all we can give you is that $5,500 loan that,
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:31.440]   you know, the direct loan."
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.220]   So nothing changed, although you went through the effort of, you know, planning and increasing
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.060]   your need.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.660]   So if you're going to go through the planning and increase your need, you need to be reasonably
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:49.060]   sure that it's going to provide some benefit if that planning is going to cost you something,
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.060]   right?
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:55.780]   If you shuffle assets around and pay off your debts and now you have less flexibility or
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:59.980]   there's a negative to that, now you're trying to compare the negatives of what you did to
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.460]   the positives.
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:05.660]   And if you say more financial aid is in the positive column and you're wrong, well, then
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.620]   maybe you shouldn't have done whatever it is you did.
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.620]   Right, right.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.380]   I think it's a valuable point and I appreciate you making it.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:16.180]   And then to add to it, you also still have to make sure that the use of the time and
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:21.100]   the money in the first place is best spent on college and is best spent on this particular
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.620]   school.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.300]   What's the opportunity cost for the student going to this school?
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:30.420]   Are you rearranging things when in reality it might be better off to just give the student
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:34.380]   $10,000 and say, "Here, you should invest this in yourself some way and if you want
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.300]   to use it for college, do it or don't."
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:43.060]   But you don't want to engage in creative planning without benefit.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:48.140]   It's just for those circumstances, for those people who are in a situation like this, then
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:52.820]   some of these creative ideas could potentially be employed in advance if they are certain
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:56.380]   on what their goals are, which is where we started with what are your goals.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:57.380]   Right.
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:00.700]   And to clarify again, planning kind of falls into three categories.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.620]   There's planning you can do that it's just a net benefit no matter what, right?
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:09.540]   Even if the college falls through or whatever it might be, getting your debt in order, you
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:13.180]   know, saving for retirement, those types of things are going to help no matter what.
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:17.500]   So it doesn't, you know, it's not just for college that you're doing it.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:22.940]   And then you have planning that's around college.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:25.080]   But you've got it nailed down.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.060]   You know the school you're going to attend, you know what it's going to cost, you know
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:33.400]   how the aid works, and you know that if you do this, you'll get that.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.060]   And that's where I spend a lot of time again working with parents of high school students
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:44.740]   where colleges, it's not a should we go to college or it's which college are we going
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.460]   to and how are we going to pay for it.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.180]   The college decision is already done.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.180]   It's going to happen.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.180]   Right.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:53.340]   Now, how do we do it in the most cost-effective way?
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:54.340]   Right.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:59.900]   So I think that's important that, you know, and once you land on a particular path, just
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:04.500]   like, you know, people might say that, I don't know, a vacation home is a good deal or a
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.660]   bad deal, doesn't matter.
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:10.020]   If you're going to do it, now figure out how to do it in the best way.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.020]   In the best way.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.020]   Right.
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.020]   Right.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:18.180]   So one just very simple example that came to mind with using this debt principle, consumer
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:23.860]   debt can certainly be considered, you know, for a simple way to utilize that is if you
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:30.060]   have $20,000 sitting in the bank and you have $20,000 in a car, assuming you can't leave
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:35.660]   yourself in a cashless position, but you also have a car payment, if you can use that to
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:40.700]   pay off the car as a capital asset, you clear the $20,000 from your bank account and you
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:45.180]   eliminate a car payment, which allows you to lower your income and be able to get by
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:49.900]   with a lower income because you've cleared out the need for that income.
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:54.420]   That would be one simple way that in some circumstances could be approached.
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:06:00.060]   Or another one, Brad, what about I have a mortgage, I have lots of cash in the bank,
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:03.940]   let me go ahead and just move the cash, pay off the mortgage, and then I'll go ahead and
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:07.660]   just set up a line of credit on the house so that I still have access to some of that
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:11.340]   liquidity if I need to by being able to pull from the equity.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:15.340]   But because it's going into my primary residence and because I'm getting rid of cash, that
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:19.220]   could for some people make a big difference or at least make some difference in their
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.220]   form.
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:21.220]   Are those good examples?
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.580]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:29.020]   And then allocating debt between your primary residence and your rental property as an example.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.620]   So explain that one.
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:34.500]   Well again, on the FAFSA, they don't care about your home, your home equity, or your
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:35.500]   debt.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.940]   So you can have a paid-off home and it's not counted against you.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:42.100]   You have a paid-off rental property and it's very much counted against you.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:47.980]   So if you're going to owe $200,000 on a mortgage and you get to pick which property it's going
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.740]   to be on, well, put it on the rental property from a college perspective.
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:54.140]   Yeah, that's a great point because generally I would go the other way.
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.820]   I'd rather have the debt on my mortgage and have my rental property clear.
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:02.620]   I mean, obviously, to look at the specific financing terms, but that's a good point that
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.140]   if you have the choice, you're looking at college coming up, now might be a good time
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:11.860]   to adjust your portfolio a little bit, clear off the mortgage on your primary residence
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.540]   and move the debt over to the rental property.
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:16.500]   Great example.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.940]   Number nine biggest mistake, poor communication with the schools.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:23.740]   I find this is one I think that affects many people.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.940]   Poor communication with anybody.
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.540]   It costs people a lot of money.
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:30.860]   In general, if you just pick up the phone and call people or communicate, you can usually
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.140]   get better deals on many things.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.140]   So good point.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:37.840]   Number 10, reporting your retirement plans as an asset.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.780]   And so again, just to emphasize this, you write that you're not required to include
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:47.100]   any sort of retirement plan as an asset when you fill out financial aid forms.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:51.100]   It's not made very clear on the actual form and many people make this mistake, often inflating
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:55.420]   their assets by hundreds of thousands of dollars unnecessarily.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.820]   Expand on that, please.
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:57.820]   Right.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:04.500]   So, every year, I find myself cleaning up after someone that tried to do it themselves
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:08.660]   and then things blew up and they're trying to figure out what went wrong.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:12.500]   And a lot of times what I see is someone's, there's three blanks on the FAFSA.
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.780]   What do you have in the bank?
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.900]   What are your investments worth?
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:17.540]   And what is your business or farm worth?
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:22.660]   So people, again, if you don't spend the time to understand what you're getting into, people
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:26.140]   will say, well, geez, I've got a million dollars in all my retirement plans, so I'll put a
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.940]   million dollars in that blank.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:28.940]   And guess what?
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:32.340]   And all of a sudden you don't get any aid, pretty much no matter what.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:36.300]   And it's because you took an asset that didn't belong there and reported it and it was counted
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.100]   against you.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:45.500]   So I see that a lot where people will put assets in the wrong spot.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.780]   And again, it's not hard per se.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:50.780]   It's kind of like taxes, the devil's in the details.
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:55.660]   You got to pay attention and make sure you understand what you're doing and do it properly.
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:00.420]   And that type of mistake can greatly inflate things.
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:05.420]   And I've seen it probably a couple of times a year for the last 10 years.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.540]   Brad, how is real property counted on these forms?
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:12.100]   You're talking about...
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.100]   Consumption property.
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:16.500]   I got an $80,000 boat and I got an RV, those kinds of things.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.820]   How are those factored in?
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:18.820]   Right.
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:22.620]   So generally speaking, all stuff that you're going to depreciate it and throw it away at
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.460]   some point is not considered.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:34.060]   So things like your furniture and your cars and your appliances and your toys, your ATVs
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:39.620]   and sports cars and boats and jet skis and all that kind of stuff, all that stuff is
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.540]   not an asset.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:46.640]   And the debt against it, if you happen to have it, is not really considered either.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:51.260]   So then you may want to take a real asset like a bank account and pay off that debt,
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:53.220]   as we mentioned earlier.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.820]   So the reason I ask that is because often I think this is something useful.
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:03.260]   Before I give my example, just to clarify, is that the same for the student and for the
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.260]   parent?
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.260]   Yes.
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.260]   Okay.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:13.220]   So I clear out, I take and give my child a $20,000 car for their high school graduation
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.220]   present.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.860]   Now we've taken a bank account and turned it into real property.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:22.820]   And then if somebody is looking to say, "Hey, I want to take my trip, but I've got all this
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:23.820]   money saved up."
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:29.580]   Well, if it makes sense, again, I always go to travel because it's just an interest of
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.340]   mine and I find a lot of people have that interest.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:35.020]   If it makes sense, this is the time that you might want to go ahead and buy the motorhome
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:41.220]   or buy the sailboat, buy the real property, pay off the personal house, pay off your personal
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.740]   residence.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.380]   You might rent it out.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:49.380]   But the point is, take the assets that are counted and consider putting them into something
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:51.980]   that's not counted, like the personal property.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:56.300]   So if you need to buy the RV to take the year-long trip to all the national parks, then go ahead
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:02.480]   and do it and use the cash from the bank so that you have less cash to report on the financial
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.480]   aid form.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.480]   Right.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.860]   And then to leverage that even further, spend the student's asset in the bank instead of
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:12.340]   the parent's asset in the bank, if the student happens to have one.
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:17.380]   So you have a student with $10,000 in the bank and mom and dad have $10,000 in the bank
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:19.900]   and you're saying, "We need a car to send Johnny off to college."
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:23.740]   Well, little Johnny buys the car.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:26.700]   And now his asset disappears.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:32.580]   And as from a family, you could say, "Well, that really would have been our money, but
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.020]   we just did that for planning purposes."
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:39.620]   Well, then you take your $10,000 and spend it on whatever to replace whatever Johnny
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:40.980]   would have spent it on.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:41.980]   Right.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:42.980]   Absolutely.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:48.960]   And you can do that easily enough with just the verbal discussion in the family without
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:54.280]   actually conveying the property, which would make it Johnny's asset.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.620]   So awesome.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.220]   Anything else, Brad, that you think is great must-remembers from my audience?
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:04.700]   I think this has been really fun to get to some of these useful ideas.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:11.960]   And I guess getting back to point number one is planning and starting early.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.980]   The biggest challenge with college planning is college is paid for with time, money, and
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.120]   emotions.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:25.560]   And if you don't start early, if you put it off as long as you can, and most families
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.640]   inadvertently do, that means you're going to have to do that much more in the time you
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   have left.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.720]   And that gives you less opportunities to buckle down and find the strategies and find the
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.840]   right schools and do all the work that's necessary.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.480]   And you end up just by default.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.840]   I have many families talk about scholarships, but they never actually do them because they
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.760]   run out of time, as an example.
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:50.440]   And I'm not saying that you should do scholarships or shouldn't, but it was their intention to
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:55.180]   do it, but they didn't know what they were getting into soon enough and they didn't have
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:58.920]   a plan to budget their time, not just their money.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:06.700]   So it's a busy process with school visits and testing and test planning and students
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:10.840]   doing AP this and prom and all the stuff that they have going on.
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:16.420]   I mean, the typical parent of a high school student has got a busy life and you're going
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:22.880]   to have to carve out some time and do it sooner than later because as you start learning something,
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:28.240]   you'll realize, "Oh, there's something else I need to pursue along the various planning
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.240]   opportunities, etc."
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:35.480]   So I recommend, again, as an example, read a book or two on the subject, plug into a
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:44.760]   podcast or two, do whatever it is that, however you like to learn about it, go do it on purpose.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:50.560]   I'll second that and on your time, money and emotions discussion, I'll just expand on that
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.080]   for a moment.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.960]   I've tried to keep our discussion today fairly mainstream.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.480]   I oftentimes turn people off with my kind of hardcore opinions about it.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:05.200]   So I've tried to keep our discussion fairly mainstream that's of help to many mainstream
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.840]   people in the idea that we want to go through the traditional four years of college at a
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.400]   traditional school.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.560]   These strategies matter.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:18.920]   But I'll just point out that if you're planning for financial strategies, usually you're dealing
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:24.080]   with the hardest thing to plan for in any area of planning, retirement planning, college
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.720]   planning, etc.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.880]   Dealing with figuring out what asset goes on your FAFSA is a lot more difficult than
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:36.760]   encouraging your child to take six CLEP exams this summer and walking away from the need
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.360]   to do an entire semester of school.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:45.880]   It's a lot easier to get the same education at an inexpensive school than at an expensive
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:52.880]   school than it is to figure out how to adjust your tax returns to try to look poor on paper
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.560]   so you can get more financial aid at the big expensive school.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:02.360]   I see so many students and parents – I like your thing about time, money and emotions.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.560]   Talking about time, you're better off – I see so many parents just miss all of the many
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.340]   scholarships that they and their students could apply for.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:12.680]   They miss the opportunity to do CLEP exams.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.840]   They miss the opportunity to take the AP CLEP classes.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.080]   They miss the opportunity to dual enroll in school.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.200]   I know somebody here locally who is dual enrolled for their high school.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:27.200]   It's a high school, government high school and government state college program and all
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.680]   of their credits are college credits but they're being paid as though it's government school.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:37.040]   So there are two years basically of free tuition simply because it's a dual enrollment opportunity.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:44.520]   It was a merit-based program for academically skilled and highly qualified applicants but
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:51.160]   it's essentially enabling the student to at the age of 18 have their high school diploma
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:58.040]   and the first few years of college done at an official local state university.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:02.140]   So there are all kinds of these programs and it's far cheaper.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:06.540]   Those are more expensive in time and emotion but they're far cheaper in money to pursue
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.880]   many of those other strategies.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:11.360]   So plan wisely with all of them.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.820]   Brad, I'll give you the last word.
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:14.720]   Any final thoughts you have and then tell us about your website.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.540]   You have a podcast on this subject, your blog, your planning services.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:23.440]   Please share all of the action points that you'd like my audience to take to connect
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.120]   with you further after this interview.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.440]   All right.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.700]   Yeah, again, I guess the bottom line is just do it.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:33.420]   Find out what's going to work for you.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:36.120]   Obviously you and I were partial to the podcast because we do that.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.680]   We create them but there's good books.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.120]   There's visiting schools.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.520]   There's all kinds of ways to learn and you're probably going to have to do many of them
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:50.360]   but I do have a podcast at tamingthehighcostofcollege.com and it's also available obviously wherever
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:56.880]   you consume your podcasts and that's a great way where you can plug in and while you're
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:02.560]   driving around to the soccer moms going back and forth or the whatever it is that you do,
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:06.600]   dads that are traveling or whatever, you can just start dripping a little bit of college
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:11.360]   knowledge into your head, you know, starting your freshman year of high school instead
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:19.080]   of your late junior year and so that you know what you're getting into and that's one strategy.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.360]   I also have a blog.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.680]   There's a couple of calculators at my website.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.880]   So tamingthehighcostofcollege.com/efc as an example.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:33.000]   I've got a great resource there where you can calculate how much aid you may be eligible
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.080]   for and then do some what ifs.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.680]   Well, what if I change this to that?
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.160]   How do the numbers change?
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:46.360]   As well as some videos that explain what goes in what blank and introduction to the aid.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.920]   So it's not just a calculator but it's a okay now that you have this number, what does it
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.960]   mean and what do you do with it?
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.680]   Scholarships, tamingthehighcostofcollege.com/scholarships.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:03.520]   There's the free parent guide to scholarships there.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:08.000]   It's designed for busy parents who need to learn enough about scholarships to know if
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.680]   you're going to pursue it or not.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:14.720]   The right answer for scholarships for some families is ignore it and move on.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:18.960]   For other families, get in there and work hard at it but figuring out what it should
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:24.200]   be for you so that you can make an informed decision, that's a resource.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:29.480]   So again, we've got lots of resources, just plug in and take advantage of them.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:34.040]   If you do want to contact me directly, if you have specific questions, I do work with
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.360]   families one-on-one as well.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:41.280]   If that seems like something appropriate for you, get in contact through the website, give
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.280]   me a call.
