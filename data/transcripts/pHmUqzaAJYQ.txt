[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.900]   - Well, 2021 is nearly done.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.200]   2022 is nearly here.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.040]   It's amazing.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.920]   And as we change out the calendar,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.080]   Pastor John shared some thoughts recently
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.260]   that I wanted to share with you here.
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.440]   He was speaking about our aims at Desiring God.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.440]   What do we aspire to do?
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.560]   What do we want to be?
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.900]   What do we want to be known for?
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.520]   What kind of reputation do we want?
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.520]   We think about these things
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.760]   because the Bible calls us to consider these things.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.440]   And for our answer,
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.980]   I want you to hear from Pastor John directly.
[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.440]   Here's what he said recently.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.360]   - At Desiring God, we love truth.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.460]   That's how we love people.
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.320]   Because Jesus said,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.320]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.800]   He said, "When the spirit of truth comes,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.080]   he'll guide you into all truth."
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.480]   He said, "The Father is seeking those to worship him
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.600]   in spirit and in truth."
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.280]   The Apostle Paul said, "When you go out to battle the devil,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.200]   put on the belt of truth."
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.440]   Jesus said, "You'll know the truth,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.920]   and the truth will set you free."
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.920]   And he prayed, "Father, sanctify them in the truth.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.720]   Your word is truth."
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.480]   And there's the key for us at Desiring God.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.520]   Your word is truth.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.360]   If you love the truth, you love the word.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.640]   If you measure everything by the truth,
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.360]   you measure everything by the word of God, the Bible.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.200]   We have a 10-year vision at Desiring God,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.200]   and we break it down into 10 facets of a fruitful future.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.120]   And number one, the very first one goes like this.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.920]   We intend, we dream, we hope, we pray,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.520]   we aim that Desiring God will be among the first ministry
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.680]   that people think of all over the world
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.400]   when they are asked the question,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.160]   "Where can I go for resources that never apologize
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.080]   for any teaching in the Bible?"
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.240]   That's what we wanna be.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.520]   And the teaching that is right at the heart of Desiring God
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.720]   is the glorious teaching, the glorious reality,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.560]   God is most glorified in us
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.120]   when we are most satisfied in him,
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.800]   most happy, most joyful, most treasuring of Jesus
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.960]   right through all the sorrows and pains of obedience.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   So we aim to be a truth-driven, Bible-saturated,
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.200]   Christ-exalting, obedience-advancing,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.320]   joy-deepening ministry.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.080]   If you love this vision, would you put us to the test?
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.040]   Would you see whether we are found faithful
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.320]   to be that kind of truth-driven ministry?
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.200]   And if you find us faithful,
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.600]   would you consider being a monthly ministry partner with us?
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.440]   We would be so encouraged with that level of support.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.640]   So thank you for considering it.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.960]   - Yes, amen, thank you for considering it.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.800]   This aim of ours reminds me of Paul's command
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.080]   to a young pastor named Timothy to, quote,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.840]   "not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord."
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.400]   In 2 Timothy 1.8, Paul himself, of course,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.680]   said that he was not ashamed of the gospel in Romans 1.16.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.000]   And it's this idea of not being ashamed,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.040]   that idea reminds me of Jesus' stark words in Mark 8.38
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.980]   when he said this, quote,
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.000]   "For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.280]   "in this adulterous and sinful generation of him
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.960]   "will the Son of Man also be ashamed
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.400]   "when he comes in the glory of his Father
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.840]   "with the holy angels."
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.200]   We must never be ashamed of God's word.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.040]   We must make no apologies for what has been revealed to us.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.240]   That's our calling.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.600]   And if that resonates with you, if you love this vision,
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.800]   consider becoming a monthly ministry partner with us.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.280]   To do so, go to give.desiringgod.org.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.980]   That's a web address, give.desiringgod.org.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.500]   We really appreciate it.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.540]   Pastor John is back with me in studio on Friday,
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.860]   New Year's Eve already.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.820]   Man, it went by so fast.
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.060]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you on Friday.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:52.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
