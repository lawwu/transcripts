[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300]   what questions you have for me, the natural next step might be to say, how
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.740]   many hours do we work here?
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.060]   Right now you're coming across as a needy person trying to understand.
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.140]   It's hard for me to say this, but if you keep asking questions, you come across
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.540]   as an inferior versus saying, now tell me about the hours at work here.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.540]   Talk a little bit about what's expected from us in our off hours.
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.940]   Talk a little bit about how we connect to each other in the company instead
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.280]   of, so how do we connect to each other?
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.340]   So what you're doing in this is one example is directing the person.
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.260]   Directing gives them the confidence that you can lead them, that you could lead
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.420]   them through the conversation and also that you can lead at the job.
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.520]   And so that's a good example of me saying, shouldn't be a question.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.900]   Sometimes you just need to make a statement, take control.
