[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.300]   underway. You're about a thousand dollars a month short, but you do have a credit card,
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.140]   which is available for you, and you could use it to cover your thousand dollars of expenses if you
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.140]   need to. So assume for a moment now that you start borrowing a thousand dollars per month on your
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.180]   credit card, just until you can get another job and get your feet back underneath you. Assume that
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.620]   happens. So you do that for one month, then you do it for another month, three months, four months,
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.620]   five months, and then you do it for the next month. So you do that for a month, then you do it for
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.620]   three months, four months, five months, and then you do it for the next month. So you do that for
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.620]   three months, four months, five months, and then you do it for the next month. So you do it for
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:23.640]   six months. And then after six months, you are now able to be re-employed, you get another job, and now you can start paying your bills again, and you no longer have to borrow money on the credit card in order to pay your bills. But over time, you've accumulated a total of six thousand dollars of debt. Perhaps some of that is grocery expenses to feed your family. Perhaps some of that is paying for your electric bill and your water bill. Perhaps some of that is
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.160]   do

[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.480]   You may set out a goal for yourself of paying off your debt very quickly and very aggressively. Perhaps you do it in six months. But what that means is for a total of 12 months, your choices were severely affected by the pandemic.

[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.480]   And so what happens is your income is already beholden to someone else paying off your debt. And so yes, you had six months of trial of your being without work. But unfortunately because you go into debt, that six months of trial is not a good thing.

[00:28:51.120 --> 00:29:00.500]   Well, unfortunately, my staff came in and I was able to lighten my burden.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:06.380]   But instead of taking that extra time and putting it into those higher dollar activities so that I could make more money,
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.840]   I just took more time off and I didn't make any more money.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.500]   So I didn't make any more money, but I was going into debt to pay my staff.

[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:33.600]   contrue? I felt dumb. I felt worse than dumb. I felt foolish. And worse than that, I had nothing to show for it. Because those lazy afternoons and lazy evenings when I could have done a little extra work and not been in debt, now I was going to have to lay off my staff and redouble my work in order to pay that debt off.

[00:30:43.460 --> 00:31:13.460]   A lot of people regret it, but at least they still have this thing, this shiny flashy thing that they borrowed for. A lot of people regret it when they buy a nice trip, a nice family vacation, put it on a credit card and debt and a year later they're still paying it off. But at least they can go back and look at the memories, the pictures and have the memories of the great family vacation. But I'll tell you what, there is almost no form of debt worse than to spend months and I don't remember how many months have passed.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:43.480]  , I don't remember how many months have passed.
