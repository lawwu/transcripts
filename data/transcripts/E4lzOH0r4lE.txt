[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.160]   Welcome to Portfolio Rescue, where we're always happy to hear your comments and questions.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.480]   Remember, our email here is AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.740]   Today's Portfolio Rescue is sponsored by Innovator ETFs.
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.200]   This week's Wall Street Journal had a story about buffered ETFs, which anyone who's been
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.520]   watching this program knows about.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.520]   So here's what they said.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.360]   "A popular set of exchange-traded funds that claim to guard against investors' losses up
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.400]   to a point by limiting potential gains.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.080]   These buffer funds have attracted $6 billion of inflows this year, already doubling last
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.240]   year's record of $3 billion in inflows."
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.400]   John, throw the chart up here.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.300]   Do a chart on of the assets here.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.300]   Just piling in.
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.440]   You can see people want some more defined outcomes.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.320]   They also mention Innovator ETFs in here.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.960]   They say, "The J.P. Morgan Hedged Equity Fund won, and the U.S. Equity Power Buffer ETF from
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.280]   Innovator Capital, two of the biggest funds in the space, are easily beating the market
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.000]   this year, down 6.3% and 5.7% respectively."
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.440]   John, do a chart on of the performance here, which kind of shows.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.960]   You can see both of these hedged funds beating the equity market this year.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.960]   They said, "During the first half of the year, both of these funds were down about 11% compared
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.280]   to a 23% drop from the S&P, but then after the market bottomed and rose a little bit,
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.680]   they didn't quite catch up the same," so that's kind of the trade-off here, is that you get
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.400]   a little downside protection, but you don't always go up as much when we have these bear
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.800]   market rallies, at least that's what they seem.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800]   Pretty interesting.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.880]   Innovator tells me that they're closing in on $10 billion in asset center management,
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.320]   which is a relatively new firm still.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.320]   Pretty interesting.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.320]   They've brought in $3 billion this year alone, which is crazy.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.400]   To learn more, remember InnovatorETFs.com.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.200]   Duncan, a couple weeks ago, I mentioned that I didn't necessarily want the stock market
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.280]   to race back to all-time highs.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.720]   I said, "I don't like this rally very much, because I want people to be able to invest
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.720]   at lower prices."
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.640]   I wasn't making a prediction, per se, but maybe more of a request to the market gods.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.080]   And it looks like I got my wish.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.040]   I think sometimes an extended bear market is good.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.480]   So, we're on month eight now.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.360]   It's September, the market peaked the very first day of the year.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.080]   I think it's pretty safe to say we're on an extended bear market.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.880]   John, let's do a chart on here.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.960]   This is every S&P 500 correction since 2008, when one got over.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.000]   So, you can see, this is the number of trading days that they've gone.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.840]   And the blue line you can see here is 2022.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.320]   The only one that took longer to recover is 2011.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.080]   So, I guess if we recover in the next couple weeks, we could still beat that one, potentially.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.440]   But 2011 stocks were already going back up at this point.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.640]   Right now, they're going down again.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   We're in an extended bear market.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.200]   You can see all these other corrections that we had in bear markets in the past had already
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.480]   made their money back up and gone back to all-time highs.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.840]   You can see, even the 34% drop from 2020, at this point, at this length of time, had
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.560]   already gone down that 34% and made money back to all-time highs.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.300]   So, this is an extended bear market.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.560]   On last week's Animal Spirits, Duncan, I know a lot of people don't go in the YouTube comments.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.640]   I put my hazmat suit on and I go into the comments, because I'm a man of the people.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.640]   Right?
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.600]   I'm not one of these coastal elitists that won't check the comments.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.880]   I look at them.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.820]   And someone said, "You guys are way too bearish lately."
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.240]   Now, this is the first time in my life I've ever been called bearish.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.680]   I've been labeled a permable before, but never bearish.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.560]   And I think what we're doing is, we're just kind of reporting what's going on around us.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.460]   Because the Fed has said, in the last two weeks, they're openly rooting for the stock
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.460]   market to go down.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.460]   Interest rates are rising.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.460]   Inflation's at 9%.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.080]   There's plenty to be negative about right now.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.720]   My whole thesis on life, though, is that we get through stuff, and this, too, shall pass.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.400]   And I wouldn't even consider myself being bearish, I'm just trying to be realistic.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   But I think my whole thing on this is, it's okay to be bearish.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.760]   It's not okay to stay bearish.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.200]   That's the problem for too many people, is they get bogged down in the negativity and
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.320]   negative headlines, and it seems like there's a lot of negativity these days.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.600]   I think the problem is when you get stuck in that mindset and don't realize that we'll
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   get past this.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   We always do.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.980]   But I think the longer-term bear market, it's good if you're saving money.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.980]   Just keep putting money in.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.840]   I mean, you're pointing out negatives in the market, and the market has a bunch of hurdles
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.840]   to face.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   It's not like you're shorting the S&P or anything.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   No.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   I'm still following my rules.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   I'm still following my plan.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Same thing.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   Just kind of trying to point out what's going on.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   Right.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   Okay?
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.280]   This is probably the only time I've ever called bearish in my life, so I'm just going to take
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   it.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.960]   Maybe I'm going to read Zero Hedge today at lunch.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   I don't know.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   We'll see.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   First time in a while.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.960]   Let's read the first question.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   Maybe we have you do the next show wearing a bear suit.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   All right.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   First question.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   Okay.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.640]   Up next, or up first today, we have a question from Will.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.180]   This is a long one, but a good one.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.440]   What do we need to think about in downgrading to one income?
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.080]   My wife and I welcomed a pandemic baby, which I didn't know that's what people were calling
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.080]   them, but I guess that's the thing.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.080]   Makes sense.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.480]   We welcomed a pandemic baby almost a year ago.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.000]   I work at home and have some childcare help from grandparents, but we are thinking of
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.240]   having me go part-time or less in order to care for the kid.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.200]   Work from home with an energetic one-year-old is way different than work from home with
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.500]   a baby that spends half the day napping.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.920]   We also hope to be blessed with one more kid before we hit 40.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.020]   I worry that these are my prime earning years, but watching our child grow up is priceless
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.600]   and childcare is fairly expensive in our area.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.620]   I can also support my wife's career, which she finds meaningful.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.000]   My career is in spreadsheets, and while it doesn't make me want to throw myself off the
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.200]   roof, it's not particularly exciting either.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.280]   We also started having kids late, age 37, so we are fortunate to have a nest egg, $150,000
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.080]   income, $40,000 to $50,000 of spending a year, 2.5% mortgage.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080]   Look at that.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.080]   That's pretty nice.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.700]   That's $50,000 for retirement and a six-month emergency fund.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.180]   I had dreams of retiring early and this would slow it down.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.900]   What are your thoughts?
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.580]   My wife and I went through a similar decision-making process during the pandemic.
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.820]   When we had our twins in 2017, that's when she decided to go part-time because we already
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.140]   had another child, so twins was a lot on our plate.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.340]   She'd always kind of thought about retiring to take care of the kids from her job, and
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.620]   the pandemic kind of forced her hand because it was so difficult going on and off and on
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.700]   and off with school and all this stuff.
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.000]   So she quit about nine months into the pandemic.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.760]   This person's at a different stage in life than we were, but I understand where they're
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.760]   coming from.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.640]   We've talked about the high cost of childcare on the show before.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.860]   This is actually the first year all three of my kids are in public school.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.580]   My birthday was a couple weeks ago, or last week, I guess, and two weeks ago, and someone
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.140]   had said, "Happy birthday," and they said, "Are you celebrating?"
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.280]   I said, "No, I'm celebrating the fact that my kids are not on daycare, I'm not paying
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.280]   anymore."
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.280]   That was more important to me than my birthday.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.140]   I've got to have priorities here.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.920]   Assuming the grandparents can't stay full-time with childcare, your decision basically boils
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.740]   down to, are we a one-income family or daycare, right?
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.380]   And you said it's fairly expensive where you are, so it's pretty easy to do the cost-benefit
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.380]   there, right?
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.460]   And for a lot of people, childcare can be almost as expensive as one parent's income,
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.000]   depending on how much you make.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.220]   And you told us, again, it's expensive where you live, so I mean, this could obviously
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.220]   tack on a few years to your early retirement, but I don't know, are you really going to
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.700]   regret spending more time with your child if you do this?
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.700]   I don't think so.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.020]   I don't think my wife regrets it.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.460]   Here's a few things to consider that we went through in this process.
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.780]   Number one is benefits, right?
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.660]   My wife had really good benefits at her former employer.
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.020]   She had a really solid 403(b) match, and we had to give that up, and so that's kind of
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.020]   tough.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.380]   So you have to think through what are your benefits, what that change is going to be
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.900]   like if you leave your job.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.900]   Do you think you'll be able to get another full-time job when kids go full-time or maybe
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.900]   part-time?
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.380]   Do you want to go back to the working world maybe when the kids go back to school?
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.380]   That's something to consider.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.220]   Do you even want to go back to work, or is this going to be a full-time thing?
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.020]   Have you tried living on your wife's income and being a one-income family for a couple
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.020]   months?
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.020]   Try that for a few months.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.300]   See if it works, and just bank your money for now as savings, because you're going to
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.300]   have to do it someday, right?
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.300]   Might as well start now.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.660]   And then the other thing is, psychologically, are you okay giving up on the working world?
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.540]   Because you're going to be asked some insensitive questions, right?
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.980]   You know, "Oh, you decided to stop working and your wife's working."
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.580]   It shouldn't be that way, but it is that way.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.380]   And for any parent who does this, my wife gets asked all the time, "Well, what are you
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.580]   going to do when the kids go back to school?"
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.260]   And her answer is, "I'll do whatever I want, whatever I need to do to get done," right?
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.740]   And so I think there's a lot of insensitive and sometimes inappropriate questions people
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.300]   get asked on this, but my answer to that is screw them.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.460]   You do what works for you, what works for your family.
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.940]   Don't worry about what other people think and if other people are going to judge you.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.660]   I think it helps that you already have your finances in order.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.660]   You obviously have a high savings rate.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.580]   If you're spending $40,000 to $50,000 a year and you have $150,000 income, you're doing
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.820]   pretty good in terms of your spending-to-income ratio.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.460]   So it sounds like you're as ready as anyone to pull this off if you can, if you want to,
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.860]   but those are just some things to consider.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.420]   Yeah, no, I mean, I think you hit the nail on the head there.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.020]   It sounds like they've thought it through really well and they're just kind of wanting
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.540]   some encouragement to do what they want to do.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.300]   But yeah, like you're saying, this is bigger than just the...
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.460]   This is bigger than the financial side of things.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.100]   Yeah, if you have the financial stuff taken care of, it's probably the emotional and psychological
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.700]   impact is bigger than anything, but I don't think this is something that you're going
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.980]   to regret in the years ahead.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.340]   So if you have to rip the bandaid off, do it, but I just make sure you can live on one
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.340]   income for a while and try it out and again, bank your money so you have some more savings.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.900]   Let's do another one.
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.380]   Okay, up next we have a question from Martin.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.580]   My wife and I just had a baby and we live in one of the nine states that offer a prepaid
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.060]   college plan.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.460]   By making either a monthly contribution or a lump sum payment, we can walk in the current
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.980]   cost of in-state tuition, which is about $30,000 in Florida.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.580]   If our son chooses not to go to college, the money can be refunded.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.980]   Do you have any thoughts on this type of investment?
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.340]   How do you expect the cost of college to inflate in comparison to potential compounding growth
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.540]   in a 529 or brokerage account over 18 years?
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.220]   This one's triggering me a little bit, right, because we know the direction college tuition
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.220]   seems to...
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.460]   Yeah, John, throw the chart up here.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:49.140]   This is the CPI of college tuition and fees versus the regular consumer price index.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.340]   This is since the late 1970s.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.220]   You can see college has basically doubled it up on an annual basis, like 6.5% almost,
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.340]   to roughly 3.5% for the CPI.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:02.020]   You can see in the early 2000s it just took off like a rocket ship and went even higher.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.340]   I don't know.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.340]   Can this growth continue?
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.500]   It can't go on like this forever, right?
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.500]   But I don't know.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.660]   My dad said people said that 20 or 30 years ago, and it still did.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.380]   There's a lot of financial problems like this that you're trying to plan for that don't
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.380]   have a perfect answer.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.380]   How much do I need to save for retirement?
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.420]   Well, I don't know, how much do you spend?
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.020]   What returns should I expect to earn in the market?
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.020]   Well, I don't know.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.020]   Who knows going forward?
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.460]   What should I set as a baseline for inflation expectations?
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.780]   This past couple of years has told us that we don't know anything about that.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.180]   What will my future tax rates be?
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.180]   I don't know.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.180]   What is the government going to do?
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.180]   What are the politicians going to do?
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.300]   So, this is another one where how much will college cost when my child reaches that age?
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.980]   It's impossible to know, right?
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.540]   And here's the other thing.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.220]   College probably isn't going to be as expensive as you think, depending on your situation.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.380]   So, Ron Lieber wrote this book called "The Price You Pay for College."
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.620]   He had a few stats that kind of blew me away.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.460]   The average first-year full-time student, this is in 2019 and 2020, got a discount of
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.380]   52.6% off the list price.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.900]   So, we see these huge list prices in the sticker shock you get.
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.900]   Most people don't actually pay that.
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.420]   The average grant for public universities is more than $4,100 per student.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:10.140]   89% of students at private colleges get a needs-based or merit-based discount on tuition.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.660]   And so, the people who end up paying full freight are mostly international students,
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.220]   very rich people, and then people who want to attend more selective schools.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.300]   So, the average price people pay for private colleges, including room and board, is like
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.300]   $24,000 a year.
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.300]   For in-state public universities, it's around $15,000 a year, a couple years old for these
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.300]   stats.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.180]   So, it's not nearly as bad as you might think.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.460]   So, I think a lot of this boils down to how much certainty do you want?
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.700]   Like, how important is it to pay for your child's education?
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.340]   I know for some people, this is a huge priority.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.660]   Other people say, "I'm going to do my oxygen mask first, and I'm going to save for retirement,
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.140]   and then the kids can figure it out either through working in college, or getting a scholarship,
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.060]   or going to a lower-paying college, or a community college, or whatever it is."
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.860]   It sounds to me like this is probably a priority for these people, so, I mean, I don't know.
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.500]   One of the worries people say, "Well, what if online education is much bigger in the
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.700]   years ahead, and it's cheaper?
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.900]   And what if your child doesn't want to attend that public university in Florida?
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.260]   And what if the government actually does something about the cost of college?"
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.580]   So, a lot of this depends on how much do you want to plan?
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.540]   Because no one knows what it's going to be in the future, but if you can lock it in now,
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.060]   and that certainty is more important to you than for your financial planning than anything,
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.020]   and you can get that refunded, if that's a priority, I don't see a problem with it if
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.180]   you're taking that uncertainty, if the uncertainty is a big problem.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.300]   Because I know a lot of people say, "Well, who knows what college is going to look like
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.460]   in 15, 20 years, or whatever it is?
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.060]   So I'm just going to roll the dice and see what happens."
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.620]   If you want to take that uncertainty off the table, I can see the appeal of that.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.660]   Well, I've never heard of this before, but I'm guessing it's not all or nothing, right?
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.560]   You can put whatever amount you want in towards the college, right?
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.340]   It's not like you have to pay the full tuition price right now, or do you know?
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.340]   I honestly don't know.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.940]   We don't have this in Michigan, for sure, so that's a good question.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.580]   Yeah, I've never heard of this, so yeah, kind of a cool idea.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.300]   Someone send us an email and let us know if they know us more on this.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.300]   I honestly don't know.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.300]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:04.620]   Up next, we have, "Recently, my father passed away, leaving roughly $150,000 to me as an
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.620]   inheritance.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.220]   I'm trying to figure out if I should save or invest it.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.820]   I'm 26 years old and served four years as an Army officer.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.700]   I will be separating honorably soon, where I will go back to school and may need to access
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.820]   these funds.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.200]   I also may need to use them to buy a future house or get married.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.140]   I'm afraid of investing the funds short-term, less than three years, due to market volatility.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.860]   CDs and some bonds seem like low returns when interest rates are rising.
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.340]   Shouldn't I wait to purchase a CD if interest rates continue to rise?
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:39.020]   I did purchase IBONS with a 9.62% interest rate, but I still don't like the idea of the
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.600]   rest of my money sitting in a savings account yielding almost nothing.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.700]   Is sitting in cash the safest bet short-term?
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.260]   Sorry for your loss, and also, thank you for your service."
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.820]   Two weeks in a row of inheritance questions.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.520]   Again, I said this was going to be coming, and we got another one this week.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.300]   This is obviously a follower of Portfolio Rescue, because they're in the IBONS.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.140]   They listened to us there.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.920]   As we know, there's a cap on there.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.300]   The good news is, this person has their risk profile and time horizon figured out.
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.620]   They know this is short-term money.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.700]   They don't want to take a huge risk.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.860]   They want to earn a little bit of yield, but they don't want to risk.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.300]   And again, we talked about the emotional baggage behind this.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.060]   Because this is an inheritance, it could have a little more to it behind it.
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.580]   So, this person sounds like they got the good first step.
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.340]   The bad news is, for a lot of investors, the Fed is raising interest rates, and they're
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.140]   trying to bring the stock market down.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.340]   But the good news is, for savers, those interest rates mean higher yields that you can earn.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.680]   So, John, do a chart on the Treasury yield curve here.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.780]   You can see, especially on the short end, interest rates have come up a lot.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.380]   So, at the beginning of the year, we're talking a handful of basis points for 3 months Treasuries,
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.420]   which is basically the short-term T-bill rate.
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.460]   It's like 3% now.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.940]   It's gone up almost a full 3% on the year.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.600]   A lot of short-term yields for Treasuries are now yielding more than long-term.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.220]   And that is the biggest bang for your buck right now, because the Fed is raising rates,
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.940]   and long-term rates aren't going up as high.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.220]   So, the reason this matters is because short-term bonds have much less interest rate risk than
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.220]   long-term bonds.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.020]   In the past, investors were being forced out on the risk curve.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.540]   That's not the case anymore.
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.700]   Now it's the opposite.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.540]   Rates are higher on short-term bonds than long-term bonds, and it's like you're being
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.980]   paid to take less risk.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.420]   This is a good thing if you're looking to save cash or cash equivalents, especially if
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.260]   you're looking for safety of principle.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260]   So, here's some simple options we've talked about before.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.540]   SHY, ZI Shares, 1 to 3-year Treasury ETF.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.540]   I looked today.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.420]   The average yield to maturity is 3.5% on that fund.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.780]   That's higher than the rate you get on TLT, which is a 20-plus year bond market, which
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.720]   is down 20% or 30% right now from the highs.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.540]   You could also look at muni bonds, like the iShares Short-Term Muni Bond Fund.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.100]   I think it's SUB.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.380]   That shows an average yield to maturity of 2.4%.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.420]   So, depending on your tax rate, we could do a tax equivalent yield where we back it out
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.020]   if this is in a taxable account.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.620]   We're talking probably 3% to 3.5% on a tax equivalent yield, depending on your tax rate.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.220]   Marcus, the one that I use for an online savings account, now yields 1.7%.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.740]   I think Ally, I looked today, was more like 1.85%.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.260]   Capital One 360 is 1.75%.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.500]   I think those will go up as the Fed continues to raise rates, assuming they do.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.020]   So, savers can finally earn some yield on their cash.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.700]   You can't exactly move to the beach and live off the interest on this anymore, but at least
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.340]   it's something, compared to the past, where you're basically getting nothing.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.140]   So, you're right, you don't want to put it in a brick-and-mortar bank, where you're still
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:18.500]   probably earning 10 to 20 basis points, which should, frankly, be criminal, if I'm being honest.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.940]   The fact that the banks still don't pay anything.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.540]   They're earning 6% on mortgage rates, and they're paying out 10 basis points on their
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.540]   savings accounts.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.540]   Share the wealth.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.540]   Seriously.
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.740]   I mean, you do still have to deal with a high inflation rate, but compared to the 0% you're
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.940]   earning years ago, I'd say don't accept anything below 2.5% to 3%, if we're talking short-term
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.940]   bonds.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.020]   And again, you could match up the duration of the bonds now with your actual maturity
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.460]   of when you want to spend this money.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.020]   So, like I said, there's a one-to-three year treasury.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.020]   You can kind of match it up.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.420]   So, anything below 2.5% or 3% today probably doesn't make sense if you're looking for a
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.740]   short-term something or a CD.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.740]   My question for another day is, with stocks and bonds both down double digits in the last
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.260]   year, will more investors now start allocating to cash or short-term bonds?
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.180]   I think that'll be interesting to see.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.420]   That's a question for another day.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.820]   But there's another element here.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.420]   This person is leaving the military.
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.740]   And so, why don't we bring in our favorite former armed service member, Bill Sweet?
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.620]   Because there has to be something else going on here.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.740]   Bill, any other special considerations for someone who's leaving the military in terms
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.740]   of their finance?
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.660]   Because I have to imagine there's a lot of stuff that I don't even know about.
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.300]   So, what do we got here?
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.660]   A lot of great, great things that could potentially help.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.460]   I want to start, though, saying I was decked out for this show, pre-show.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.620]   And Duncan made me change my shirt.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.340]   He told me I can't wear white before or after Labor Day anymore.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.220]   I don't want to get canceled.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.220]   So I changed.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.220]   You had like three days.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.220]   You could have still stayed in white.
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.220]   I know.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.620]   And again, Ben, I know you claim to be a man of the people, but maybe you've got something
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.620]   going on there with Duncan.
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.620]   Duncan runs a tight ship here.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.620]   I mean, just don't mess with him when he gets in your wardrobe.
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.620]   I know.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.620]   Duncan, I'm not going to call you what Michael said yesterday.
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.620]   Oh, my God.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.620]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.620]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.620]   But I'm also happy.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.620]   So, yeah.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.620]   So, thank you very much for your service.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.620]   Do we have a name for this listener?
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.620]   I didn't catch it.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.260]   Actually, it got lost in the copy and paste.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.260]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.260]   Sorry.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.260]   So, but thank you very much.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.100]   And again, my brother, for taking on arms, especially the last couple of years.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.500]   I think it's been a very difficult time.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:14.100]   But no, I think the number one thing that popped in my mind was post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.500]   And Ben, I don't need to get too much into details, but I did about six years active
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.500]   duty.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.060]   And I'm qualified for like 40% of tuition to a public university, and they can subsidize
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.380]   some things.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.020]   The really neat thing about the GI Bill is that you also qualify during your school time
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:33.100]   for BAH, Basic Allowance for Housing, which is this tax-free benefit for military personnel.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.620]   It's a very powerful thing.
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.080]   So I definitely look there, but I do want to give the listener credit.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.080]   They're prepared.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   They're thinking about all the right questions.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.140]   Ben, I love your answer.
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.380]   If you're getting 5% for corporates and taking corporate risk and about 3% for munis, it's
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.300]   really hard to argue there.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.540]   And I would say for any taxpayer, if we're going back to school, I'm guessing there's
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.700]   not going to be a lot of income in that year.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.620]   Standard deduction this year is almost $13,000, right?
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:03.060]   And so if you're putting that 150K and you're earning 3%, that's about $4,500 a year.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.060]   And in theory, if your income is low enough, that comes all tax-free, right?
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.160]   Treasuries are completely state tax-free.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.200]   The only other thing I would mention is about IBONs.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.160]   I know that you guys did this in the past, but one of the things that's interesting about
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.480]   them, the limit is $10,000 per person per year, right?
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.840]   We're about four months today from the end of the year when you can refund that with
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.240]   another 10,000.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.420]   If you happen to be married, you can have one for your spouse.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.480]   You can have a spousal account.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.840]   If you have two kids, you can have a child's account too.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.200]   And the really interesting thing is for LLCs, trust, basically anything with their own EIN,
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.900]   you can also fund up to $10,000 for IBONs.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.600]   So there's a bit of cost-benefit analysis.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.720]   Is it going to cost more to put up an LLC just to invest in IBONs?
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.640]   But there's nothing that we can tell that would prohibit you from doing so.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.000]   Obviously, consult with your legal and tax advisors.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.140]   But Ben, I think you pointed them in the right direction.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.040]   One other thing I want to add here that I can't believe you didn't do because it's a
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.040]   layup.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.040]   So they have 150 grand.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.400]   I think they're not going to spend it all.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.520]   I think you take, what is it?
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.920]   What's the max limit for IRA?
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.920]   6,500?
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.920]   7,000?
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.920]   No, 6,000 this year.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.360]   So take 6,000 of that and max out your Roth IRA, right?
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.360]   Yeah, 100%.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.520]   Because if you realize later you need all that money for the wedding, you can still
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.520]   take your contribution out.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.880]   So I think you should probably, especially as a young person, max out that IRA for a
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.840]   year and at least get that out of the way and help yourself there get that started on
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   the right foot.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.280]   And the other nice thing, so Roth IRAs didn't pop into my mind, Ben, because that's more
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.560]   of a long-term vehicle, right?
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.440]   There's no qualified distributions until age 60.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.600]   But if you get a little bit over your skis, A, out of the total inheritance, that's a
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.760]   small amount, right?
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.760]   That's less than 5%.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.800]   It's about 5%.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.420]   And then you can take non-qualified Roth distributions, get your basis back tax-free.
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.320]   So if you get over your skis, you find the perfect house, you can take that distribution
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.400]   early from a Roth.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.720]   So I think that's a great answer, Ben.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   Yep.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   All right.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   Duncan, one more.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.720]   OK.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.480]   Up next, we have a question from Dave.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:58.200]   My mom is retired and receiving about $1,100 a month from Social Security.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.920]   She has about $50,000 saved and is interested in investing the money.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.680]   Unfortunately, she doesn't have an IRA, and I read that she can't open a Roth as a retiree
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.360]   without any earned income.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.040]   I was looking at opening a brokerage account for her, but I have some questions.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.280]   Will the investment income from this account be tax, dividend, and equity growth?
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.120]   I read that if her Social Security benefits plus additional income don't exceed $25,000,
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.800]   she doesn't have to pay taxes.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.280]   Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.380]   All right, Bill, this is your time to shine.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.380]   This can happen.
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.380]   You mentioned that standard deduction.
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.020]   It was someone who has a low income and not a lot of assets.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.840]   She could potentially pay zero taxes in retirement.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.240]   Is this true?
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.240]   It is true.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.240]   It is true.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.160]   And I think that they brought Social Security to the top of the question.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.160]   I think that's a smart place to start.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.040]   And the listener is correct-- Dave is correct-- that if your income is below a certain threshold,
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.800]   I believe, for individuals around $30,000, $40,000, your Social Security benefit is 100%
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.800]   tax-free.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.400]   And so that ends up being a pretty powerful thing.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.260]   Average Social Security benefit in the US is about $1,200, $1,300.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:03.300]   And so ultimately, if you can get $12,000, $13,000 tax-free, and then stack other income
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.720]   on top of that to take advantage of that standard deduction, which is actually higher for seniors,
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.140]   it's about $15,000, $16,000, you stack those benefits up, and ultimately, mom's in a great
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.700]   position for that.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:20.080]   So even if we're talking 5% to 8% on that $50,000, and she's getting that back in capital
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.340]   gains when she sells, or in interest income or dividends, probably with that standard
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.500]   deduction, still not going to be paying any taxes in retirement, right?
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.500]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.500]   I would think so.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.700]   And the listener's specific question is, what should I do with mom's assets, right, because
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.100]   I don't want to mess up this really perfect tax picture.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.180]   I think where they're going is the right thing to do.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.820]   You probably don't want to generate a ton of current income.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.420]   And so I think some sort of-- I mean, the IBON is perfect for this, because ultimately,
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.060]   all that interest compounds until the year of distribution.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.780]   So therefore, you have a little bit of control over when that income gets realized.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:55.460]   But I think the absence of that, which is just-- it's this perfect sweet spot of Treasury-protected
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.420]   high interest income, I think some sort of brokerage account where you can control when
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.820]   the income gets realized makes a lot of sense for this listener.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.380]   And for $50,000, that $10,000 limit is going to be 20% of the account, right?
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.380]   Correct.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.380]   So it's actually a meaningful amount here.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.380]   Correct.
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.380]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.380]   And going back to the prior question, that popped in my head too.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.000]   Like, so let's say the individual's going to school.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.100]   They don't have any earned income.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.300]   You cannot fund a Roth IRA.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.520]   You cannot fund a retirement account if you don't have earned income in the present.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.540]   So I think the suite of options is kind of limited for this question, listener.
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.540]   I would, again, point to IBONs.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.260]   I think that's a great place to start.
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.760]   And then after that, look at a brokerage account.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.660]   This could be just the government does weird things.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.820]   Here's something I don't understand.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.420]   So we pay into Social Security taxes.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.140]   Why is it taxed when we get it back?
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.700]   Why do they tax it again?
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.700]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.780]   Logic and reason need not apply when it comes to federal benefits.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.780]   Don't ask these questions, Ben.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.780]   Come on.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.780]   I'm just a simple man here.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:44.780]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:51.740]   I think the concern is that if you're below a certain income-- so it's this means-tested
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.740]   thing, right?
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.540]   The federal government in the last three years, I believe, has spent somewhere in the neighborhood
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.380]   of $3 or $4 trillion more than it's taken in.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.420]   So that's part of the answer.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.940]   I think the other part of the answer is, like, why not police?
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.940]   Why not firemen?
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.500]   Why not folks that work for the government?
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.520]   Why is their income taxed?
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.660]   It's all part of the same system.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.420]   And I think the general answer is you probably don't want to create a lot of privileged classes
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.420]   within society, right?
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.220]   I think that's probably the right answer.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.100]   And ultimately, it is tax-free if you're below a certain income.
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.540]   I don't really philosophically have a problem with the means test on tax.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.220]   It doesn't hurt me.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.340]   Progressive taxes are a pretty good thing for society, I think.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.340]   Bill Sweet, a man of the people.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.340]   All right.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.340]   Duncan, another question.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.020]   Also, Bill just said the name of what his podcast would be if he was doing options trading.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.180]   I think you said the suite of options.
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.180]   Suite of options?
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.180]   I like that.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.180]   Would that be good?
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.180]   I bet.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.180]   Not my thing.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.180]   I'm a low-cost index fund.com guy.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.180]   OK.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.180]   But God bless you, day traders.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.180]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.180]   I think we have some watching, usually.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.180]   So yeah.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.180]   Love it.
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.180]   Shout out day traders.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.180]   Great work.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.180]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.180]   All right.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.180]   Great to be back.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.220]   I was listening to your episode on real estate being an inflation hedge, and I heard Bill
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:02.060]   Sweet talk about the tax advantages of doing a 401(k) rollover into a Roth account during
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.500]   a market downturn.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.220]   If I were to do a rollover with my self-directed 401(k) and I currently have unrealized capital
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.700]   losses, how would those losses be treated on my taxes?
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.920]   Could I use that loss to offset any capital gains I might have from other investments?
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:22.020]   If so, would offsetting be treated differently for short-term or long-term capital gains?
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.020]   All right.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.020]   Bill, the people are listening here.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.620]   They want that succulent tax-free withdrawal from a Roth.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.500]   Now I assume people who have just started making contributions in the last couple of
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.700]   years, those are the people who are going to have some losses, and they're the ones
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.200]   who want to roll them over.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.860]   So how does this work?
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.940]   Because it's all-- you think it's segmented, but it's all one pool.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.060]   So how does this work for offsets and other stuff here?
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.060]   Very succulent.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.100]   Again, this is a dangerous episode here.
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.980]   We're hitting some really uncharted territory when it comes to taxes.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.500]   But Ben, we've got to back the truck up.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.220]   When we're talking about tax accounts, there's really two different types in the world, right?
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.660]   There's tax-qualified, and your Roths go in there, your 401(k)s, your traditional IRAs
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.660]   go in there.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.780]   The theory there is any income, any distributions, any capital gains, anything that's going on
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.220]   in the account doesn't get taxed until you distribute the asset.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.640]   Meanwhile, you have a non-qualified account in your second bucket.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.060]   Non-qualified is what we were talking about a second ago.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.820]   You open a brokerage account.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.900]   If you sell or gain at a loss, you have capital gains, you have losses.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.700]   But the difference is everything happens in a current tax year versus before bucket one
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.700]   is deferral.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.660]   So again, bucket one, deferral, bucket two, taxable.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:32.740]   I believe what Zach is asking about is 401(k), and a 401(k), there's no capital gain to be
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.820]   discussed there.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.800]   More than likely, Zach took a tax deduction.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:41.180]   He did not pay on any tax when he funded that 401(k), and so any distribution, including
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:45.500]   unit conversion, is going to be taxable based on the value of the conversion, not based
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.860]   on the gain in the account.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.920]   That's a very important distinction to keep in mind here.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.580]   And then ultimately, what we get from that is tax-free growth in the Roth, right?
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.860]   So there's a trade-off.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.620]   But the ability to-- Right, so the taxes are paid either way, whether
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.620]   those gains or losses.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.620]   That's what I'm getting at.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.620]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.140]   So I don't think capital losses in a 401(k) are a thing at all, because the benefit there,
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:09.100]   the benefit of using these tax-deferred vehicles, including Roths, is you're not paying tax
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.580]   when the income's received.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.980]   Therefore, the capital gain is probably moot, and therefore, this question is not terribly
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.580]   relevant, unless we're talking about funding a Roth IRA from non-qualified assets, which
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.580]   I don't think was the question.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.580]   Right.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.220]   So the point is, if you're going to do that rollover, you're just going to want to make
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.460]   sure you're having the ability to pay the taxes that you already deferred in the first
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.460]   place.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.460]   That's it, 100%.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.980]   And point of privilege, when you're doing this, if you are doing a conversion from a
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.220]   401(k), from a traditional IRA to a Roth, you really want to make sure that you're paying
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.260]   the tax from outside the account.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.500]   Because ultimately, if you're paying tax, if you're doing a tax withholding on the conversion,
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.620]   that just means you're not converting the whole balance that you possibly can.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.200]   Just do a smaller amount, right?
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.100]   So if you're thinking about, "Okay, $10,000 is what I can afford, I'm going to pay out
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.100]   $2,500 in taxes."
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:57.780]   Convert over $7,000, do the lower conversion, and then pay for that with non-qualified assets.
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.100]   Do not tax withhold on a Roth conversion, if you can help it.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.300]   Also, credit to Duncan here.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.300]   He's paying attention.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.620]   He asked, he said, "I think this person's thinking about it the wrong way when they're
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.620]   doing this rollover."
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.300]   Duncan spotted this one beforehand.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.300]   He did.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.300]   He smelled it.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.300]   Yeah, I know.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.300]   We're proving Michael wrong.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.300]   He's 50,000 miles away.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.300]   Nice work, Duncan.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.300]   All right.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.300]   One more question.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.300]   I took a practice.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.740]   What is that intro exam that you have to do for finance, the S-I-E or something?
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.740]   I can't remember.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.740]   I took a practice one recently.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.420]   I got like a 50.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.420]   Wow.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.420]   That's great.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.420]   All right.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.420]   Three years.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.420]   Three years at the firm.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.420]   Last week.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.420]   Congratulations.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.420]   We're getting there.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.420]   Okay.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.420]   So last but not least, we have a question from Kendall.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.980]   And this one is going to make a lot of us that live in very expensive places very jealous.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:44.780]   "I'm 22 and live in rural Missouri, one of the cheapest places to live in the United
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:45.780]   States.
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.240]   Not to brag, but my rent for a studio apartment is $300 a month.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.420]   I max out my Roth IRA, which is my sole retirement account, and will fulfill my retirement goals.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.580]   No 401(k) option at work.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:02.980]   While it is great to think of all my retirement money that will be tax-free in 45 years, should
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.320]   I be setting aside part of my IRA contributions into a traditional IRA?
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:13.460]   My thought behind that question is if I have no taxable income in retirement, my deductions/credits
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.020]   would be going to waste every year after I retire.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:21.660]   Would setting aside, say, $500 on my max contribution for a traditional IRA be something to consider?"
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.660]   They've kind of lost me on this.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.660]   So I'm curious to hear what you have to say.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:28.100]   The impressive thing here about them maxing out the Roth IRA is that their Roth IRA contribution
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.220]   every month is bigger than their rent.
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.220]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.220]   Right?
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.220]   This is impressive.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.220]   It's amazing.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.220]   Pay yourself first.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.220]   I love it.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.220]   This is the second person that's looking to minimize taxes in retirement.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.220]   This is a big Roth guy.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.420]   We've already established that.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.540]   But what do you think about diversifying your tax base if this person wants to have some
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.740]   diversification in retirement?
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.820]   Does that ever make sense in your mind?
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.820]   It does.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.140]   However, let's talk about Kendall's situation.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:55.140]   So just like Ben, Kendall's looking down on us with his Midwestern bias and his low rent.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.140]   But leaving that aside, I love this idea.
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:01.920]   I would advocate for diversification in tax, diversification of portfolio.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.180]   But talking about tax, there are three types of accounts you can have.
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.100]   And I would argue for you want all three of these.
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.980]   When you hit your 60s, you want to have a traditional IRA bucket, right, or 401(k).
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.820]   You want to have some taxable income that you can manage.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.420]   You want to have a Roth bucket that's tax-free.
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.440]   And you also do want to have this non-qualified bucket that we just referenced a minute ago.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.700]   You want tax diversification in retirement.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.500]   But Ben, man of the people, Ben, when you were 22 compared to where you are now around
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.500]   your 40s, right?
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.020]   So I'm guessing that was a full 18 years in the rear view mirror.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.980]   Are you earning less or more today than you were at age 22?
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.660]   Not to brag, I'm earning more money now than I was at 22.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.660]   God bless you.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.660]   Nice.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.660]   I wish that for Kendall, too.
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.100]   I would say on average, people's incomes tend to increase through over time, right?
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.500]   Unless you're an NBA player, Kendall, unless you're a Jenner, more than likely what we're
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.460]   talking about here is your career earnings are going to increase over time.
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.660]   I wish that for you.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:55.300]   Therefore, Ben, are you paying more taxes or less compared to age 22 today?
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.300]   You're my tax guy.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.300]   You know I'm paying more.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.300]   A lot more.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.380]   I would advocate that your tax rate is exponentially higher.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.460]   And therefore, I would argue in your 20s, your income is the lowest, your tax rate is
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.280]   the lowest, the Roth is beautiful, right?
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.300]   Because you're paying tax on that income before you contribute it.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.300]   Now let's fast forward.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.340]   Let's get into our 30s.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.620]   Kendall is no longer paying $300 a month rent.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.380]   He's paying $3,000 a month rent for like those of us.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.660]   And that's a bargain, by the way, in New York City right now.
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.460]   And now at that point, when you're making 60, you're making 70, you're making $100,000
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.460]   a year.
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.140]   God bless you if you can make it that far.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.180]   Now your income is being taxed at 30%.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.580]   Maybe you move to New York, it's getting taxed at 40%.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.380]   That's the time when you want to do this traditional IRA because your tax rate's higher.
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.380]   Do the Roth early.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.940]   Kendall, you're doing it right.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.380]   Max fund that puppy to the extent that you can.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:43.580]   Focus on traditional IRA contributions later in life when you can take that tax deduction,
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:44.580]   when the tax deduction-
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.380]   And if you have some extra money, put it into a taxable brokerage account, maybe start building
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.380]   that up.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.380]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.380]   I love it.
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.380]   Especially if it's like an index manage.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.180]   Let's say it's something that's doing taxless harvesting for you, absolutely, Ben.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.500]   The buckets matter, but now's the time to do the Roth.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.500]   Duncan, I'm telling you.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.500]   You have the beard.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.540]   It fits in Brooklyn, but it also could fit in Missouri too.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.540]   Just think about it.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.540]   Yeah, I'm considering it.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:04.540]   All right.
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.540]   Bill, we have one more question to you from one of us.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.540]   I'm not going to say who.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.540]   One of us on this show completely paid off their student loans.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.540]   One of us-
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.540]   Wow.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.420]   No, one of us had some of their student loans forgiven.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.240]   That person wants to know, is this a taxable event for them?
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.500]   That is a great question.
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.000]   Per the CARES Act law, which I'm going to detect in 2021, any student loan forgiveness
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.180]   abatement at the federal level, and this is important at the federal level, is not taxable
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.220]   through, I believe, year 2025.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.220]   The answer is no.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:39.700]   Assuming this Biden program survives the courts and legal challenges, then no, it will be
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:40.700]   not taxable.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.300]   However, and there's always a catch, there are a bunch of states that de-conformed with
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:50.160]   the federal law, and so it's possible in up to 14 states right now per early analysis
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.380]   that the state may apply tax unless the legislators change-
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.100]   How about New York?
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:33:01.260]   New York complies generally, and so I believe that New York will not be taxable as income,
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.960]   but follow up with me on that in December.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.960]   I'll be back-
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.960]   Score it down.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:05.960]   ... on a rescue.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.960]   Okay, cool.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   I've already spent that 10K on a Ford GT.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   That's great.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   That's why I was making sure.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   I love it.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.960]   I love it.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   Let's move to Missouri.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   Also, I found out-
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.960]   What are we doing here?
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.960]   God.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.960]   Our question three, our army officer is Richard.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960]   Richard.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.960]   Thank you, Richard.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.960]   Richard, thank you very much.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   Sorry about your dad.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.960]   Sorry to hear about that, but Richard, thank you for keeping us safe.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.960]   All right.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   Thanks, everyone.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.960]   Thanks, as always, to everyone in the chat.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.580]   We appreciate you guys following along, making comments.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.580]   Thanks to Bill, as usual.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.580]   Like Ben's dad.
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.580]   Honest Dave is here with me in New York.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.580]   Big Abe Lincoln fan.
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:36.660]   Happy Labor Day to those who celebrate, too, and are bringing kids back to school.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.660]   I am.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.660]   It's good times.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.660]   Perfect.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.660]   Yes.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.660]   Is that what it's for?
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.660]   That makes sense to me.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.660]   It is.
