[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.020]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode we're gonna talk about how to predict a stock market bottom like Nostradamus
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.760]   Now I think everybody everybody is wondering when will this stock market bottom?
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.060]   We have seen massive violent corrections more on the downside than on the upside
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.860]   I mean we're talking 4% 8% 10% moves
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.240]   Every day for a couple weeks and it's so exhausting and I hope none of you guys are watching too closely
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.040]   Because it can really put a damper on your mood
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.180]   Unfortunately for me given I'm in finance. I write about finance
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.980]   I have to look at these market moves and I do want to help you guys think about
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.100]   How to invest for the future and I also want to help you guys calm your nerves if you're feeling a little bit jerry
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.940]   So regarding a stock market bottom, nobody knows for certainty
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.420]   When it will be and at what level it will be but we can make some highly educated guesses and as rational
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.220]   Investors, which I think are all of you who've been reading and listening to financial samurai all these years
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.180]   It's important to educate ourselves in this time of chaos
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.140]   The first thing we got to do is look at history
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.660]   How have previous bear markets performed and then maybe we can get an idea of how this one will perform
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.260]   We know from history that the average bear market lasts about 17 months and corrects about
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.980]   35% from the peak
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.980]   therefore the S&P 500
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.380]   could bottom at about
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.860]   2200 in
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.200]   2020 or 2021 second we can look at valuations
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.900]   We can just look at normal PE valuations forward or current valuations. We can look at the CAPE ratio
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.960]   It doesn't really matter so long as you consistently look at the valuation over time. So let's just look at
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.060]   PE ratio
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.220]   we know from history that the median PE ratio is about 15 times and when the S&P 500 was at
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.460]   2530 just days ago
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.020]   The PE was at 19 times. So if we see a mean reversion
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.900]   the S&P 500 could fall down to
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.500]   2000 and that's a higher from
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.740]   3386 now the final way to predict a stock market bottom is my favorite way and that's making educated estimates on
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.300]   Quarterly earnings percentage declines in a bear market to guess the total earnings change for the year
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.340]   After all the S&P 500 value is made up of its annual earnings times multiple now
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.020]   I want to remind you that this whole earnings estimate exercise is to help you find
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.820]   Entry points into when you want to invest I'm assuming all of you guys will want to continuously invest in a bear market
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.180]   Because history has shown that the market has always recovered whether it's in 17 months 24 months or whatnot
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.420]   Over a 5 10 20 year period chances are you're probably gonna be higher and making money
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.100]   The other reason for this exercise is to calm your nerves because right now when it feels like the whole world is ending
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.260]   People just go crazy and get really freaked out and just start selling everything
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.060]   Like you see with the US Treasury bonds people just selling selling selling
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.420]   They just want cash and maybe cash under the mattress of things get really really bad
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.940]   These things do happen and it's important to have a calm and rational head
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.780]   So let's go through and talk about earnings estimates with the corona virus really starting to scare folks in America since early March
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:48.040]   2020 we can make an estimate that March earnings will decline by 100% now that is an extreme estimate
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.340]   But let's just do it. Anyway, therefore just doing a little math first quarter earnings will decline by 33%
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:02.220]   For the S&P 500 now, let's make another extreme guess that the second quarter 2020 earnings will again decline by
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.980]   100% due to absolute paralysis
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.420]   Nobody's spending any money. We're all on lockdown
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:17.620]   Grocery stores are closed. It's just shutdown mode and survival mode not even toilet paper online is available because the world ran out
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:25.220]   Now let's make another guesstimate that third quarter 2020 earnings will decline by 30% as the economy recovers
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.900]   but not to its original expectation at last hand sanitizer supply becomes more readily available in stores and
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.960]   hoarders like that one guy in Tennessee who bought
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.380]   17,700 to upsell at 10 to 20x to make a profit man
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.620]   I understand trying to make a profit and taking care of your family, but we're in an epidemic brother
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.060]   And if you're gonna gouge people because you want to make 10x to 20x. I just don't think that's right
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.180]   It's probably illegal, right?
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.340]   And then this guy goes on the New York Times with his picture and his name and says what he's been doing
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.620]   He's trying to gain
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.420]   Sympathy from the public. I mean that has to be a sign of being a sociopath not getting what he was doing
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.880]   Was wrong or probably not going to be looked favorably among and this is something else for folks of you who want to get media
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:27.220]   Attention and so forth. You got to kind of be careful with what you say and tell journalists because journalists know how
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:35.700]   Probably their story will be received. So just be careful what you say you could get really pummeled in the media
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.380]   Okay, sorry about this tangent now fourth quarter earnings. Let's talk about flat
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.660]   We're back to our original spending amounts, which could prove to be conservative given the phenomena of revenge spending
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.580]   It's quite interesting revenge spending it's happening in China right now where people were just shut out
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.940]   Well, they're quarantined in their apartments for two months or so
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.020]   And then now that they're able to go out and the stores are opening right Starbucks is opening
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.980]   The fancy malls are opening everything is back to almost normal in China. They're spending their catch-up spending and they're spending like no tomorrow
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.280]   They're they want revenge for having to to be cooped up in their small apartments for so long
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.560]   They want to buy things to make themselves feel better. And I think that could happen in America, but we shall see
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.100]   now the baseline assumption is
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.000]   Quarterly earnings equals one where one is the market assumption of earnings
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.660]   It does not matter what the actual earnings numbers are folks
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.740]   You don't have to know that, you know, the quarter number is $42 or whatever
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.140]   Everything is relative in finance and I'm trying to simplify this thing for you
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.020]   And the other assumption is that the market trades based on expected earnings, right?
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.100]   For example by the time you see the number of new coronavirus cases, you know decline drastically
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.940]   The stock market will probably have moved up 10 20 percent. Well, depending on how much it fell
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.540]   So you always got to try to think ahead of the curve
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.520]   this is really tough for I think most people do but I've always encouraged everybody to
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.140]   forecast their misery
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.820]   Forecast the future to try to build their wealth and also protect themselves from sadness and be happier
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.500]   Right, that's at the end of the bottom line is to live a good life and be happy
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.380]   So let's go through the numbers first quarter down 33 percent
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.900]   One turns into 0.67 second quarter down 100 percent one turns into zero
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.260]   third quarter down 30 percent one turns to 0.7 and
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:37.200]   Fourth quarter 0% change one stays at one. So you add up these quarters you get a total of
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:45.780]   2.37 out of 4 which means a 41 percent earnings decline and now you take that 41 percent and you chop that off
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.780]   the all-time high of
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.160]   3386 and you get a scenario where the S&P 500 will bottom at
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:59.060]   2000 now it's up to you to ask yourself whether these earnings assumptions are conservative
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:07.680]   Optimistic or realistic in my mind. They're a little bit conservative even for this dire movement founder
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.060]   There's no way second quarter earnings will decline by a hundred percent
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:17.540]   Therefore let's make some further better educated guesses about quarterly estimates. We do know that the travel
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.820]   Hospitality food and entertainment industry is going to take a major hit right Airlines
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.780]   cruise ships
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.820]   Those earnings are probably gonna go down 80% maybe 90%
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.560]   however, the consumer discretionary sector, which is what
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.780]   This industry is only counts for about 10% of the S&P 500 in 2020
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.260]   the largest sector weightings in the S&P 500 are
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.940]   technology 24% health care 14% financials 12% and
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.660]   communication services 11%
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:55.340]   These sectors account for more than 50% of the S&P 500 and you can see how technology would probably outperform
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:03.980]   Probably because technology is kind of what drives the world and it's not as if technology will be shut down if you're at home
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:10.620]   At home, you know spending money online or using, you know, zoom or whatever it is health care at 14%
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:16.040]   I think you can see a case where maybe health care earnings stay flat or maybe they go up for some companies
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.340]   Because we're in a global health care pandemic scare
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.180]   communication services similar
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.260]   Financials, yeah, not so good
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:31.100]   Therefore instead of forecasting a hundred percent decline in the S&P 500 earnings for the month of March
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.660]   Let's forecast a 50% decline and as a result
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.300]   First quarter 2020 earnings will decline by about 15%
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.340]   Now, let's forecast a realistic
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:48.620]   70% decline in second quarter 2020 earnings as citizens realize how serious the coronavirus really is and
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.140]   Because we're on lockdown. We can't do anything
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:59.700]   Although consumer spending will shift online and the utilities and health care sectors may see flat earnings. Let's just stay conservative and
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:07.620]   Then third quarter 2020. Let's forecast a 30% decline as people gradually start spending again as a number of
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.140]   coronavirus cases and deaths decline or at least the pace and
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.260]   The fourth quarter, let's just keep it flat again because I think
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:20.820]   After three quarters of spending less than normal, you're gonna see some catch-up spending
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.940]   Holiday season consumers are thankful to have made it through a scary time period and a bear market
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.740]   So in this more realistic scenario in my opinion
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:38.780]   The total earnings will be 2.85 out of 4. So that is a 29% decline in earnings
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:45.460]   If valuations stay the same the S&P 500 will decline by roughly 29% from its peak level of
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.600]   2.86 in other words under this earnings scenario the S&P 500 will bottom at around
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:58.800]   2400 now given the S&P 500 has already declined past 2400 intraday. It was like around
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:06.700]   2300 it was like on March 18th a believer of this earnings model can either think the bottom is already in or
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.500]   We'll be buying the S&P 500 index under
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:18.060]   2400 again personally, I think there's gonna be closer to a v-shape recovery in demand at some time during the second half of 2020
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:24.020]   I don't know when but I think the fear of the pandemic will fade will pass
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.180]   I mean, we're gonna hear more and more cases more and more deaths, unfortunately
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:34.500]   But every day you hear it you just suddenly I don't know not suddenly just eventually start getting in there just like
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:40.340]   All the deaths you hear in the news from a car accident or whatever and I'm not saying they're the same thing
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.500]   I'm just saying it's just the way we are
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:47.820]   We are on this hedonic treadmill where we get used to great gains and great wealth
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:55.000]   And then we when we start losing things and we start suffering we start kind of getting used to the suffering as well
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.660]   It's just on the up and the down we kind of adapt
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:03.540]   And I do believe that in the second half American consumers will start spending like there's no tomorrow again
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.460]   I mean the US consumer is a mega spender, you know, we save
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:14.280]   Four to six percent of our income. We like to spend more than we make usually sometimes
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.380]   I don't know. Look at the credit card data
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.980]   I mean, why are people putting stuff on credit card at a 24% APR and keeping revolving credit card debt?
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.460]   That's crazy
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.020]   But you know that happens and that is going to happen again
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:34.020]   And I think you just can't count out how much we consume how much we eat how much we consume or whatever it is
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:41.300]   Therefore I think maybe my third and fourth quarter earnings estimates of a 30% decline and no decline
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:48.420]   Might be conservative and then one of the many silver linings to emerge from the corona virus pandemic
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:54.940]   Maybe that those people who had full-time jobs and kept their full-time jobs throughout the crisis
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.940]   Will have more money in their savings account due to the lack of spending opportunities
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.460]   So with more savings, they should have more financial security
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.180]   They should be better prepared to weather the next black swan event
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:15.780]   They might even start practicing more sound personal finance habits and they might have more money to invest for the future
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.980]   another potential reason for optimism is the massive
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.380]   fiscal stimulus plan and the monetary stimulus plan already
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.060]   So the Fed is kind of I'd say 90% out of bullets, right?
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.340]   They cut their Fed funds rate to 0 to 0.25%
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:39.460]   They're buying back a lot of treasuries now the federal government the fiscal stimulus
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.780]   It's probably where it's gonna be most effective and one of the biggest fiscal
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:49.420]   Stimuli, is that what you say stimuli is to start sending households a thousand dollar a month
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:55.020]   Checks as a form of universal basic income until the pandemics under control
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:03.020]   so maybe it's a thousand dollar or more hopefully in April and then another thousand in May and maybe it's
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.820]   Like a graduated level like people who make less than I don't know
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.740]   65,000 get a thousand people make less than a hundred thousand get 800
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.340]   People who make more than whatever it is
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.500]   a hundred hundred fifty two hundred thousand get nothing that that sounds logical to me and then
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.100]   People with kids because kids are so expensive and there's no school
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.900]   Might get I don't know
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:32.460]   $500 per kid who knows UBI is probably the most effective way to support Americans immediately and
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.820]   Directly and we got to get this done and we're gonna get a bigger
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:42.260]   Deficit as a result, but you know what the deficit who cares about the deficit now when there's a global pandemic
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:49.300]   We got to help our people who are hurting the most now and we've got to support our small businesses in our communities
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:54.700]   The one thing we can all agree on is those executives who were making mega millions
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:01.540]   Better not get any mega million bonus packages for getting bailed out this time around and another thing
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:06.280]   there's like this whole argument about no bailout packages for airlines and
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:12.500]   Cruise ships because they spend a lot of their free cash flow buying back stock and enriching the executives. Yes
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.380]   I totally get that argument
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:20.980]   But these industries employ hundreds of thousands of people and if you don't bail these companies and industries out
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.700]   More people will suffer as a result and that's not good for the economy
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.260]   so obviously there has to be some kind of delicate matter where we
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.620]   Bail out and help the people who are most affected, you know, the hard-working Americans
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.940]   They're making 50 60 70 thousand 80 thousand a year the median household income
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:46.340]   Not you know, the the whatever the airline executive who has a ten million dollar bonus when you know the airline industry
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:53.800]   Artificially propped up its share price and then underperform the S&P 500 by 10% I mean that's come on. Everybody knows that's BS
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:00.500]   But people these executives they don't think it's BS because money is too
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.780]   Too attractive too alluring to decline when it's that amount to do the right thing
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:12.060]   So I think the federal government is gonna get it right this time around. They're gonna prop up the money market funds
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.980]   They're gonna bail out
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.420]   Very very consciously and I think things gonna be better this time around
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.060]   And guess what folks I do admit with the whole world shutting down
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:30.380]   It's very hard for me to believe that 2400 or a 29% decline in the S&P 500 marks the bottom of this bear market
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.700]   Especially since the average decline is closer to about 32 to 35 percent
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.340]   Everything feels hopeless now
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.580]   It really does but it feels exactly like it did in 2000
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:47.600]   I was right there on the trading desk and in 2008 and 2009 when I was in my early 30s
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.620]   And I had a decent amount of exposure to risk assets
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.700]   Everything felt hopeless. It always feels hopeless
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.900]   until you see
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.900]   things suddenly change
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.660]   We also know that the market tends to overshoot on the way down
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:08.840]   Therefore it wouldn't surprise me and it shouldn't surprise you if we see closer to 2000 to 2200
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.420]   bottom for the S&P 500
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:16.900]   Mostly due to extreme fear if you look at a lot of companies man the way they are priced
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.100]   They're priced like they're going out of business
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:25.140]   their price like the cash on their balance sheet is gonna run out way sooner than later and
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:33.540]   It's just buh-bye. And yes, unfortunately, there's gonna be buh-bye for many companies who are not well capitalized
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:39.780]   But I think there's gonna be companies the majority of them who are gonna survive and I think things are gonna recover
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:47.340]   Like they always do I believe we will flatten the curve with social distancing and come out of this crisis stronger than before
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.360]   And I believe because of the quickness of the downturn
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:57.560]   I think the positive is that it's gonna be a quick upturn given. It's a consumer shock
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.180]   Where nobody wants to spend any money or nobody can spend as much money
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:10.660]   So wherever the S&P 500 is when you listen to this podcast, it doesn't matter when it could be in 2020 2025 2030
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:17.580]   Whatever. I encourage you to calculate backwards the implied earnings estimates and see if they make sense
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:24.420]   If they don't make sense, then you should take action obviously at your own risk to try to profit in
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:29.100]   Finance we call this back of the envelope calculation and I think it's effective
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.540]   It's an effective way to calm your mind
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:38.260]   Just like writing is an effective way to calm your mind and it's effective way to figure out when to deploy more
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.980]   capital on the way down now, I
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.040]   Personally am going to be holding my nose and buying more
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:52.740]   S&P 500 and various other stocks about 10% of my holdings are individual stocks whenever the S&P 500 is below
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.700]   $2,400 because I believe in the earnings model that I created
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:06.060]   So if you would call me Nostradamus, I'm gonna say the bottom of the S&P 500 is 23 to 2400 and I'm a buyer
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.120]   But don't listen to what I'm doing because my situation is different from yours
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:16.700]   Remember people have made fun of me for a couple years now that I've been too conservative with my investments
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:23.620]   My main goal has been to try to earn about a three times rate of return on the 10-year bond yield
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.380]   So last year when the 10-year bond yield was at
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.600]   Two and a half three percent. I was trying to get a seven and a half percent to ten percent rate of return
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.140]   Now this year now the 10-year bond yield is only at 1%
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.440]   So I'm trying to get a 3% rate of return, you know, honestly, I'm trying to get more than that
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.860]   But I I don't have a job folks. I don't have steady income
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.380]   I don't have a wife who has a full-time job or is freelancing
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.860]   I'm just a stay-at-home dad who's trying to make the best of things just like many of you guys
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:57.180]   So I don't have that ability to take more risk and this is why I'm spending so much time
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:02.820]   Thinking about entry points thinking about asset allocation. I think a lot
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:09.140]   Because it's important you've got to think about your finances. Otherwise, you're gonna blow yourself up
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.220]   You don't want to be you know
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:18.660]   the person who's gonna be retiring in the next three years with 80 90 100 percent of their net worth in the equity market and
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:24.180]   Then it's just done. So you've got to work probably five three to five more years
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.420]   You need to think about this and it reminds me of the situation
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:33.900]   I remember in school where the people who would raise their hand to ask question to ask the teacher to clarify
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.780]   Were made fun of they were made fun of by the people who didn't take things seriously
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.940]   We got to take this seriously folks, and this is why I will continue to write
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:50.980]   Continue to record and continue to try to slice through this chaos to help myself and help all of you guys
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.380]   Get a better handle of your finances. So thanks so much everyone
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:02.060]   I appreciate you guys listening and reading and if you want to share my work subscribe to the newsletter or this podcast feel free
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.060]   Just spend time thinking things through
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.620]   Because the people who are panicking are just not thinking things through
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.420]   Take care everyone and wash your hands
