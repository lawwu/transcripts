[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.840]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.880]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.580]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm so excited you're here today.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.560]   Now, when I think of a small business like a laundromat,
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.080]   I don't usually think of it as an investment opportunity,
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.520]   let alone a cashflow business
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.520]   that could make millions of dollars.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.720]   But my guest today, Cody Sanchez,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.260]   quit a lucrative career in finance
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.100]   to start investing in what she calls boring businesses
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.240]   like laundromats, car washes, vending machines.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.640]   And since then, she's successfully built
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.340]   a $50 million portfolio out of it.
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.240]   She is a true contrarian thinker
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.640]   who has an exceptional ability to see beyond the surface
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.580]   and find hidden opportunities that others often overlook
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.380]   because they seem too boring or unexciting.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.380]   Cody also runs Contrarian Thinking
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.060]   where she uses her own experience
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.620]   to teach people to think critically
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.120]   and build cashflow unconventionally.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.400]   We're gonna talk about how anyone can start investing
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.440]   in these small, boring businesses,
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.560]   why you might want to, what you might want to look out for,
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.560]   the do's and don'ts of deal-making,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.900]   different ways to incorporate contrarian thinking
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.180]   into our daily routine and our relationships,
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.480]   and a lot more.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.640]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.720]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.420]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.080]   And even if you've already filed,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.560]   being proactive about this year
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.360]   to lower your future liability is so important.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.920]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.100]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.400]   to handle everything for my business and personal taxes.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.940]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.540]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.960]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.580]   that gives you personalized guidance
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.400]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.120]   but also everything is backed by an in-house team
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.380]   of expert CPAs who can recommend
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.280]   the most effective tax strategies
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.480]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.620]   And best of all, you can have this transparent,
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.380]   open communication with your team
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.320]   in whatever way works best for you,
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.660]   whether that's on their platform, over email,
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.860]   in Slack, or scheduling a call.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.400]   Finally, my favorite story is that
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.200]   when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.700]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.540]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.400]   So they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.280]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.880]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.780]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.240]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.780]   you can skip the wait list and get started today.
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.120]   Just head to allthehacks.com/Gelt, G-E-L-T.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.020]   Cody, thank you for being here.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.560]   - Thanks for having me, I'm excited.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.540]   - So I love that you've owned the phrase,
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.640]   contrarian thinking.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.560]   I really like that people challenge the status quo,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.260]   go against the grain, whether it's life,
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.440]   investing, or anything.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.700]   We both had these early finance careers.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.100]   You had a lucrative career on Wall Street,
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.740]   and then you left it to do something,
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.040]   invest in boring businesses.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.280]   I'm sure so many people talked you out of it.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.880]   What drove that kind of early contrarian thinking for you?
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.280]   - I can't remember who said it, but I loved that quote.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.220]   What it takes to be successful is,
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.520]   first you have to be contrarian,
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.360]   and then second, you have to be right.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.260]   And I think that's true.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.520]   I mean, you know from being in finance too,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.260]   you can't make money if you follow the herd.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.860]   You'll basically pick up pennies continuously,
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.600]   but that won't ever amount to dollars.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.400]   I think the thing that made me wanna leave
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.600]   actually had nothing to do with being contrarian.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.660]   It was that it was categorically fucking miserable
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.600]   being in finance for so long,
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.340]   especially when I was at the big firms
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.340]   like Goldman Sachs, State Street, Vanguard.
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.220]   Vanguard, I thought was like, sorry, Bogle,
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.280]   but like left of communism from like a worker's perspective.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.020]   It was just, everybody is the same.
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.920]   It doesn't matter if you outperform.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.420]   It was the opposite of a meritocracy,
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.620]   which is what I wanted.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.960]   You could only progress in your career
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.760]   at certain levels and years and timelines like the military.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.820]   So I was like, this is awful, gotta go.
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.160]   Then I went to Goldman Sachs and at Goldman,
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.360]   it was the opposite.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.060]   It was like, no matter what, 20% cut every single year.
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.300]   And if you don't perform, cut.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.640]   And if people don't like you, cut.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.340]   That was a really aggressive environment
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.540]   and I actually liked it more, I think.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.220]   But then finally where I ended up was in private equity
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.840]   running with a couple other partners.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.520]   And I think what I realized, Chris, is you were smart.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.760]   You were like, I didn't last that long in finance
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.960]   and I got out.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.420]   And I think I thought, oh, it's just not this company.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.320]   It's not this company.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.160]   It's not this company.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.760]   And then I realized, oh no, I hate finance.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.320]   It just took me 12 years to figure this out.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.800]   And in actuality, maybe I'm more entrepreneurial
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.240]   and I wanna do my own thing.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.340]   And I just got sort of a really long PhD
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.300]   in how to buy businesses and how to structure deals
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.640]   from being in finance for a long time.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.680]   You remember, I mean, when you were an investment banker,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.120]   how long did you work?
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.320]   - My kind of tipping point was I didn't see
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.320]   my girlfriend then, now wife, for a week awake.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.920]   And I was like, this is just untenable.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.620]   Like, what's the purpose?
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.720]   And then I had the same experience.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.320]   I moved to management consulting
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.700]   and I remember we were courting like a Fortune 50 company.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.160]   And a friend of mine's mother-in-law
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.060]   happened to be the CEO of that company.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.940]   And I remember going to the managing director and saying,
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.140]   "Hey, I know you guys are courting this company.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.600]   "I'm gonna be at the CEO's house this weekend
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.040]   "because my friend happens to be her son-in-law.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.980]   "How can I help?"
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.320]   And they were like, "Your job is to make slides.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.520]   "Like, why would you help?"
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.740]   And I was like, "I actually have a relationship
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.840]   "with the person you're trying."
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.480]   And they're like, "That's not your job.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.160]   "This just seems like you're not thinking about business
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.020]   "as a way to like take every advantage
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.880]   "and try to be successful.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.920]   "You have these rules."
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920]   And I was like, "I don't like rules.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.260]   "I don't like rules that don't make sense.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.120]   "I love rules that make sense.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.500]   "I don't like rules that don't make sense."
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.600]   And that was like the downhill of that career.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.640]   So it was just brutal work.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.860]   The no meritocracy thing was driving me nuts.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.600]   It was just like, this is what you do.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   I ultimately got laid off.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.940]   So that kicked me out earlier.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.880]   So maybe you didn't have that good fortune,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.400]   which in hindsight feels fortunate
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.980]   and in the moment wasn't,
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.720]   but it's not like you went into this other career
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.620]   that everyone knows and it was very popular.
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.480]   You started doing something that I think
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.860]   even years later is not popular.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.520]   So maybe give a little context
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.440]   to what it is to buy these businesses,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.320]   but what led you to start doing it?
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.920]   The secret is, I think, that the really, really wealthy
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.020]   have always bought these businesses.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.580]   I mean, richest guy in the world, owner of LVMH.
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.420]   How did he get there?
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.680]   Did he start those companies?
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.760]   No, he bought them.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.960]   He bought a bunch of these companies.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.600]   Some of them basically out of bankruptcy like Dior
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.480]   and he amassed a massive empire from the fact of buying,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.400]   I mean, if we think about it,
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.920]   really bad companies, right?
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.240]   Clothing companies, they just have fancy labels on them
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.700]   that are highly overpriced.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.600]   That's how the richest guy in the world made his money.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.620]   The richest guy in India made his money
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.320]   through a conglomerate of businesses that he bought.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.800]   You look at a lot of the Fortune 500
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.520]   and what you see if you peel back the layers
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.400]   and you get rid of all of the heirs of Walmart, let's say,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.560]   and the heirs of some of the large historical industries
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.000]   like Rockefellers, et cetera,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.320]   you find that most of these people actually got there
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.960]   not always from starting companies, but from buying.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.240]   The second most common is from buying companies.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.180]   And so in finance, private equity, we did that all day.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.800]   I think that, they're not gonna like that I say this,
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.240]   but I think people in private equity are brilliant in a way,
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.080]   but it's slightly predatory.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   We are so sneaky that we make entrepreneurs think
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.080]   that putting their sweat and tears into companies
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.560]   is like the fun game.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.360]   This is what it means to be an innovator.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.920]   This is what it means to be a creator
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.640]   and to build huge businesses.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.320]   And then right about at the point
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.040]   where they wanna slit their wrists,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.320]   private equity swoops in and we say,
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.800]   is it miserable running your company?
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.300]   Do you not wanna do this anymore?
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.680]   Are you ready for something else?
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.260]   What if we give you a great offer?
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.340]   And what the entrepreneur doesn't realize
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.160]   is that zero to one is the least profitable period of time
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.220]   in your business.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.220]   The most profitable period of time
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.980]   is actually the next stage.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.060]   And then the stage where you continue to cashflow
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.700]   for a really long time on it.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.040]   And so we sort of scoop up these businesses
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.740]   at a period of time where the entrepreneur
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.500]   is in pain often, and then we cashflow on them forever.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.660]   And it's a gross generalization.
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.900]   That's not what all private equity firms do.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.220]   But once I realized that, I was like, wait a second.
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.820]   So we don't have to be clever enough
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.980]   to come up with an idea.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.280]   I'm not clever enough to come up
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.140]   with some crazy new billion dollar idea for a company.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.980]   I don't know.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.300]   But what I do know is how to look at what are expenses
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.020]   and what is income, AKA a P&L,
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.660]   and tell me if this business is making money or not.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.140]   And do I think that this business could continue to exist
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.940]   inside of the next three to 10 years?
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.700]   At which point I'll have all of my money back
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.860]   plus three to five X, let's say.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.260]   I can't go figure that out.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.860]   And because that's not that difficult,
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.300]   why couldn't I do for myself what the big, huge guys do
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.560]   with LBOs, leverage buyouts, and all of that,
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.360]   but at a tiny scale with laundromats and car washes
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.620]   and things that cost $50,000 or $100,000,
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.260]   and then scaling up to a million and then five and then 10?
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.660]   It's the same game.
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.740]   It's just I'm playing it at a smaller level,
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.780]   at the mom and pop level, than what I call,
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.980]   or what is called micro P.E.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.460]   - I think when anyone listening is thinking,
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.340]   oh, wow, Cody goes and buys businesses.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.780]   She must be a billionaire.
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.180]   It sounds like something you could actually
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.460]   make part of your investment portfolio
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.840]   at a very early stage in your wealth building journey
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.820]   and grow from there.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.220]   Would you say it's for anyone
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.300]   or who is buying a small business for?
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.940]   - The only people it isn't for are the lazy
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.100]   and the completely risk averse.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.940]   So if you wanna do zero work,
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.700]   if you want to have zero risk, then don't buy businesses.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.300]   It's just not gonna work out for you.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.100]   So if people are trying to sell you Airbnb arbitrage
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.260]   and you take no risk and you bring on these people
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.740]   and you make your millions, okay, fine, do that.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.820]   But I think for people that are willing to put in some work,
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.100]   there's no better way to make a return on it
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.580]   than having equity ownership that cash flows over time.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.380]   And the problem is, if you look at the S&P 500
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.860]   or where people typically invest,
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.140]   what is a good dividend paying stock?
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.380]   Three to maybe 9%, I mean, gosh,
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.540]   if you could get a 12% paying dividend stock,
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.380]   you're probably thinking
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.980]   that it's gonna have some downside, right?
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.220]   'Cause that's too much.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.820]   But in a small, boring business,
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.700]   you could have a return on your money
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.580]   of high double digits in a year.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.780]   You could return all of your capital within a year.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.100]   And so I think it is for quote, unquote,
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.180]   anybody that's willing to put in some work.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.740]   Now, the flip side to that is then people go,
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.060]   Cody sounds great,
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.180]   but I don't actually have millions, right?
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.780]   And I like to give examples like,
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.540]   I bought a newsletter for $3,000 just for shits and giggles.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.820]   I wanted to put it into our media empire.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.580]   I realized it didn't really fit.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.580]   It wasn't gonna grow the way that I wanted to.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.660]   So I turned around and sold it,
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.860]   I think a week later for $8,000.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.220]   And that for me at the stage that I was at
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.740]   was not meaningful.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.860]   But for young Cody,
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.140]   like the Cody whose parents had no money,
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.900]   who used to bounce her checking account every weekend,
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.860]   who kind of thought her first job
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.180]   making $37,000 a year was amazing.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.740]   That was like, I'm rich.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.620]   Like I just made 5K in a week
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.340]   off of flipping somebody else's asset.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.540]   That's fascinating.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.940]   And so if you can start at that level,
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.100]   you can start to understand the bigger levels,
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.580]   the $100,000 deals, the million dollar deals
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.140]   and the hundred million dollar deals, I think.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.620]   So yes, the return expectations of the stock market,
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.460]   maybe five, seven, 8%.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.380]   But it's very easy to maintain a job
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.780]   and do that on the side 'cause there's no work.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.740]   Is the amount of work you need to go buy a boring business,
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.660]   a laundromat or something,
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.860]   enough that you don't need to quit your job?
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.980]   Can it be a side hustle?
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.100]   Or how full time is doing this type of investing?
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.980]   Very similar to rental properties, right?
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.340]   What sucks about getting rental properties?
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.060]   Well, first you have to understand the market.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.580]   You got to understand what's a good buy, what's a bad buy.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.860]   Then you've got to actually get a mortgage.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.660]   You've got to figure out what that looks like.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.100]   Then you have to figure out how to get somebody
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.380]   to rent your property out.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.020]   But after you have that first period of understanding,
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.340]   you either Airbnb it out with some consistency
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.340]   or you get a property manager that manages it, right?
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.420]   And I think it's really similar to businesses.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.220]   Depending on the size and scale and type,
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.420]   you can have a business that's less active.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.660]   I try to not say passive
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.540]   'cause I think that's a fallacy overall,
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.660]   but that's less active.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.860]   I use the example of car washes
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.500]   and laundromats and vending machines.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.500]   I call them the gateway drug businesses.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.940]   So basically like you can get your little skin in the game.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.420]   You can get your little first hit of being in business
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.580]   and being the owner.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.940]   And then as you do that, you're like,
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.980]   oh wait, this game's kind of fun.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.220]   Maybe I'll do another one.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.180]   I'm more capable than I thought.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.900]   And I just, the world looks a lot better
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.020]   if we have more humans with skin in the game.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.020]   And I think you can absolutely do it
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.380]   while you're still working.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.260]   My caveat is always just,
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.020]   I had a boss basically back in the day.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.420]   We were in Latin America
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.100]   and we were running an investment business in there.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.980]   And we basically had to do this evolution
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.020]   with one of the government entities
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.220]   where they wanted us to run a process
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.300]   to make sure that our security protocols
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.580]   and the way we were investing
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.180]   met their government requirements, right?
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.420]   And so we ran that once, check.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.180]   All the boxes checked that we were supposed to.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.540]   They wanted us to run it again.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.940]   So we ran it again.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.420]   And then the last time,
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.340]   they wanted us to run it one more time.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.340]   And now I didn't agree
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.020]   that we should run this exercise three times.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.620]   I thought that was ridiculous.
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.940]   But my boss basically said,
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.820]   hey, this go round, I'm agreeing to this.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.220]   And the reason why is because I wanna get our leaders
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.780]   to trust me a little bit more.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.740]   And I also want to get our team used to doing things
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.580]   that are hard that we don't wanna do
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.300]   because we're gonna have to do some really hard stuff
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.500]   for this project we were working on.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.260]   There was a lot of turnaround assets.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.660]   So I need you guys to support me in doing that.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.060]   And we kind of looked around and I remember I asked,
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.940]   I was like, are they actually gonna know
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.340]   if we did this or not?
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.500]   Like, can we just check the box that we did this?
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.980]   And he just kind of looked back at me and was like,
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.060]   what do you think would be the right thing to do?
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.500]   And I was like, oh, fuck, fine.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.860]   And so basically I think the right way to do a business
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.180]   while you have a job
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.420]   is to make sure you're doing it the right way.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.140]   And I think the only thing I see going wrong
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.020]   in people's lives is I've seen people get fired
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.980]   from their jobs when they don't disclose
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.380]   that they have a side hustle.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.020]   And I think it like eats at your soul a little bit
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.620]   to not live in the light.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.940]   And so as an owner of a business,
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.660]   I take it personally if people are working in my business
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.820]   and on my business,
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.260]   and really they're like focused on something else,
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.740]   they wanna be doing something else.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.140]   And remember when you own a business in the future,
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.740]   you will be the person with employees
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.980]   that might be distracted.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.660]   So I always kind of push people to think
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.020]   like you already are an owner
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.060]   and then ask yourself what would you want
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.300]   your employees to do?
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.660]   That's my only caveat to side hustles these days.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.860]   I think the Reddit sites where they have 400 different jobs
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.980]   and these people who talk about having 37 side hustles,
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.900]   I actually think it makes you distracted,
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.940]   it makes you less happy,
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.900]   and it often makes you less money.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.580]   And so if you're gonna buy a business,
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.820]   make sure you do it the right way,
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.460]   set the right amount of hours.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.380]   And if your job doesn't allow for it,
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.900]   then pick a different job or take the risk entirely.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.540]   But don't be a human not living in the light
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.260]   is my only caveat.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.100]   - That makes sense.
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.740]   So you made the reference to rentals.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.900]   Why do you think it is that buying a rental property
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.900]   is for some reason so sexy
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.420]   when it comes to how do you spend your money
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.460]   and build your wealth,
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.100]   and buying a business like a laundromat
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.140]   is just not even on the same radar
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.460]   in terms of like societal opinion?
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.900]   It sounds from what I heard you say,
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.740]   like the returns might be even better.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.420]   They both are work.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.460]   How I haven't people caught on,
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.540]   is this like the secret?
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.300]   Obviously you're the champion of it.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.740]   - Buying rental properties is a one to 10 step process
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.740]   that is clearly defined
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.140]   and most everybody knows what you're supposed to do.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.780]   There's not a lot of variation.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.820]   You can't take a house in a neighborhood here
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.740]   and make one house do 100X more
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.660]   than the house located next to it in rent typically.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.260]   You could maybe make a house do a little bit more in rent
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.380]   by having a nicer house,
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.260]   but you're putting a ton more cash in there.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.780]   So you go step one through 10,
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.900]   you have a rental property.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.740]   Those are clearly defined.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.220]   And because of that, lots of people do it.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.540]   And so the opaqueness
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.300]   or what we would call the arbitrage window
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.460]   of people who don't know the good trade to do
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.660]   and people who do know that the good trade to do
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.220]   is actually really tiny in rental land
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.940]   'cause everybody's playing the game.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.620]   In buying small business,
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.420]   steps one through 10 look really different
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.380]   if you buy a laundromat,
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.660]   than if you buy a online business,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.140]   than if you buy a education company.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.500]   And so there's not a clearly defined process,
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.900]   which typically freaks people out.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.780]   People on the internet love for me to tell them,
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.540]   "Here's the three businesses I would buy.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.620]   "You should go buy them right now.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.620]   "This is what they cost.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.060]   "This is why you should buy them.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.540]   "This is what they should make."
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.740]   But the truth of it is,
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.100]   is that in business buying, it's all personal.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.500]   So a good deal for me,
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.940]   it's probably not a good deal for you
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.780]   because you live in San Francisco, I live in Austin
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.620]   because you need the deal to make you a million dollars a year
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.260]   and I only need the deal to make me $100,000 a year
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.100]   'cause you wanna spend 40 hours on a business
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.420]   and I wanna spend zero hours on a business.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.300]   And so that's the difference,
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.220]   is anytime there's an arbitrage window like this,
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.180]   where there's no clearly defined process,
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.700]   there aren't a ton of people doing it,
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:49.940]   you're gonna have more opportunity,
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.820]   but you're gonna have less action takers
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.020]   'cause people like to be led.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.460]   - If there's not a lot of information
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.340]   or I guess there's not a lot of process defined
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.340]   for every business 'cause it's unique,
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.500]   how much expertise does someone really need?
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.220]   Or said a different way,
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.980]   how much work would it be to get up to speed
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.900]   to be able to buy a laundromat?
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.100]   Like, I don't know anything about how laundromats run.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.660]   Do I need to become an expert there
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.140]   to really make that work?
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.100]   - In my opinion, no.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.100]   I bought a laundromat.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.700]   I couldn't even tell you today how to fix machines.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.820]   We own laundromats that do like $3 million a year.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.980]   I have no idea how to run them.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.220]   I don't know any of their SOPs and processes.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.620]   It's not that I'm lazy on that stuff.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.180]   It's just leverage.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.100]   It's like when you run a business.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.100]   Somebody asked me right now,
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.380]   how do you run your marketing segment of your business?
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.580]   What do your funnels look like?
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.260]   Do you have ads that go to your business?
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.700]   I'm like, I have no idea, that's Chris.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.140]   I gotta talk to this guy.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.500]   And it's the same with buying businesses.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.900]   So what you need to learn is how to be a deal maker,
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.500]   which I think is actually way more important.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.380]   You gotta learn what a good business looks like for you.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.580]   And we have a 10-step process in this,
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.980]   but you basically have to learn what's a good deal for you.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.660]   You have to learn how to sell yourself.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.500]   You have to learn how to negotiate.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.900]   You have to learn how to finance the deal.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.940]   You have to learn how to do diligence to deal,
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.460]   make sure they're not lying to you.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.220]   You gotta learn how to close the deal,
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.740]   like the proper structure, terms, et cetera.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.380]   You gotta get your deal team together.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.260]   So your attorney, accountant.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.980]   You have to understand what your first 90 days
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.660]   will look like post-close.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.620]   You have to learn how to value a deal,
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.700]   like what the deal is actually worth.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.420]   And you gotta learn origination, how to find a deal.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.620]   If you learn those 10 steps,
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.460]   you can apply those across any industry.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.260]   And I think the opportunity for us is like,
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.580]   most people say, I don't understand HVAC,
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.540]   so I could never buy that.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.900]   I don't understand a painting company,
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.460]   so I would never buy that.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.860]   And if you actually just understand how to buy businesses,
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.860]   you can find experts and consultants for nothing
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.740]   to help you understand a sector.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.540]   You've just gotta find the right deal.
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.700]   - So for anyone who just heard that and was like,
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.900]   whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, 10 steps.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.700]   I'm hoping that you can either send me a link
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.780]   or I could just pretty easily find those 10 steps
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.700]   written somewhere,
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.100]   and that we don't have to go deep down each one
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.700]   because that could probably be an entire conversation.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.940]   Assuming that's correct.
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.580]   - Yes, I will send that to you.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.420]   - Awesome, perfect.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.100]   I will put that in the show notes.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.380]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.220]   I get it.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.900]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.780]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.860]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.780]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.740]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.660]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.460]   take care of the supplies.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.260]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.100]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.540]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.500]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.980]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.060]   that you got through another week.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.180]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.700]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.460]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.540]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.220]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.780]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.780]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.820]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.640]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.700]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.300]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.780]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.420]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.720]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.740]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.980]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.140]   Now that it's summer,
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.620]   we've been using our pizza oven
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.300]   for pizza nights in the backyard,
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.660]   and I recently did everything homemade,
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.520]   and I am still getting compliments on that pizza.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.600]   But where did I learn how to make such an incredible pizza?
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.300]   From none other than world champion pizza maker,
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.820]   Tony Gimignani on Masterclass.

[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.220]   - So the deal-making's important.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.260]   Anything else someone needs to be thinking about
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.420]   when it comes to, like, what is a good opportunity,
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.420]   what is a bad opportunity,
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.580]   what does it look like when things go wrong?
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.060]   There are really two things that people do
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.220]   that make them unhappy that they bought a business.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.180]   One is they buy a job, not a business,
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.700]   so they go too small.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.940]   So they're like, ah, I'm gonna do this deal,
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.340]   it only has $60,000 in profit,
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.220]   but I only have to pay $100,000 for it,
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.500]   so this is awesome.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.980]   And then they realize, oh man,
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.940]   now I own a cleaning company in which I am the cleaner.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.600]   Not ideal, right?
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.820]   So typically, you wanna go a little bit bigger.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.340]   And then the second thing they do wrong
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.740]   is they don't follow some of our key commandments.
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.460]   And over the years, I've realized a few.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.020]   Like, first of all, 50/50 partnership's bad.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.640]   Somebody's in control, somebody's not in control.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.980]   That has to be the case.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.340]   No partnerships.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.460]   Two, your partner or operator who runs the business
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.460]   never gets equity day one.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.820]   They earn it over time investing year over year,
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.940]   where basically if they hit X parameters, then they win.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.860]   Three, you stay out of the five areas
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.500]   that I don't like to invest in,
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.740]   things like restaurants, FBA, hotels.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.060]   Those businesses, for a myriad of reasons, are my favorite.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.780]   Four, people, when they buy their first business,
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.440]   often buy what they think a business can be,
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.220]   not what a business is.
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.500]   So I buy facts and realities.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.740]   People often buy hopes and dreams.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.380]   And so what you really wanna do
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.580]   is make sure that the business is profitable today,
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.500]   that the valuation you're paying is the right valuation
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.180]   for how much profit you make and nothing else,
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.300]   and that you're not focusing on,
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.300]   what could I do to this business?
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.860]   This business is gonna be a fixer-upper
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.060]   and it's gonna be worth a million bucks
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.400]   'cause I'm so awesome.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.860]   Instead, I assume I'm an idiot,
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.180]   I won't be able to get this business
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.900]   to do any more revenue than it's doing right now,
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.740]   but that revenue is worth the price I'm paying.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.220]   If you do those things, you're usually pretty tight.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.180]   - Sounds like take all the advice that I learned
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.180]   being a venture capitalist
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.660]   and investing in early-stage startups
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.560]   and do the exact opposite for every single deal,
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.820]   throw it all out.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.860]   And for someone listening and thinking,
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.100]   wow, you have it all figured out,
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.980]   I have to imagine there's at least a story or two
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.780]   of a deal that just didn't turn out well
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.980]   and that everyone makes mistakes
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.960]   and that's just part of the process.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.800]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.180]   What usually goes wrong is people lie to you
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.100]   and you believe them.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.940]   I think humans, we're really good at one thing,
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.620]   which is making ourselves believe the lies that we tell.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.020]   I actually think humans are incredible self-rationalizers.
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.720]   So it's not always that the owners are bad,
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.300]   it's that they have talked themselves into a story.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.100]   We had one company I bought,
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.700]   it was actually in the cannabis space
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.700]   and it was a pretty big deal.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.980]   I think it was like a $12 million deal.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.620]   And this cannabis company,
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.060]   it was like the backbone of cannabis.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.260]   They did like packaging of products, basically.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.140]   And all the financials checked out.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.340]   We did a review of them.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.980]   We looked at their accounting.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.060]   We looked at the money that they had in the bank,
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.340]   all reasonable, the profits seemed reasonable.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.860]   So we buy the company and we leave the operator in.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.220]   We're gonna buy a large majority, 60, 70% of the business,
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.980]   and then he's gonna keep a 20% stake,
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.260]   but he's gonna continue to run it
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.180]   and it's growing pretty nicely.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:54.260]   But lo and behold, this guy got one of his friends
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.180]   to put all the money in.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.060]   So all the cash in the bank account was not right.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.900]   Had his accountant in on it,
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.420]   who was actually one of his family members.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.980]   And so his family member accountant had cooked the books,
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.220]   which we didn't realize.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.540]   He was actually in San Francisco
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.820]   and he was doing cocaine and mistresses
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.820]   and all sorts of stuff and had like an extra apartment.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.300]   So one day we have this tracking app
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.580]   that we use to follow the cash that they have
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.700]   and we see a big drop in the bank account.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.620]   And so we get confused by that.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.100]   He says, "Oh no, it's moving inventory around."
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.060]   And give some example, I don't really remember.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.060]   And then two weeks later, he calls us and he's like,
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.860]   "The thing is, we're out of cash
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.940]   and in two weeks we'll be closed down."
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.460]   And we were like, "What the,
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.060]   this company had like $3 million in the bank
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.900]   and was profitable at making 5 million.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.300]   How did, what?"
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.260]   So anyway, that deal was a ton of work.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.260]   So what that meant is we had to fire him,
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.740]   lawsuits happened, we had to take over the company,
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.620]   we had to put in a new operator
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.100]   and that happens in doing deals.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.420]   But typically you're not gonna get
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.100]   like massive fraud and lies upfront, just sometimes.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.500]   - You've done, I don't know,
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.260]   probably close to 100 deals I'm guessing at this point.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.580]   What's the success rate
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.380]   of these buying small business deals?
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.700]   - Oh, like 99%, most of the deals work out.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.900]   I can count on like one hand.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.980]   I've maybe had three deals go wrong.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.940]   That cannabis company, my very first investment,
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.780]   which was a little bit more like a venture style deal.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.100]   I invested in a friend,
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.900]   which is a good way to have things go shaky
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.580]   without much due diligence.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.460]   The only other one that went wrong
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.860]   was a business that I invested in and it was too small
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.860]   and I bought a large majority of it,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.060]   but the operator still wanted to be involved
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.380]   and it was just a waste of time basically.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.140]   So I got all my money back in that deal,
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.860]   plus three or four X.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.580]   I actually just ended up giving the business back to him.
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.980]   I was like, the thing is just never call me again.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.940]   And he was happy 'cause he had his business
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.180]   to motor along with and I was like,
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.300]   oh man, this isn't a big enough deal for me.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.220]   But for the most part, we don't have the 88% thing.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.260]   I mean, in your venture funds,
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.180]   you guys kind of assume what,
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.420]   one to five to 10% of them are gonna return the fund?
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.260]   - Usually, yeah.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.660]   The goal is you're looking for the deal
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.580]   that will return the fund.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.300]   It's a totally different multiple.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.940]   I wanted to humanize the fact that
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.420]   just because so much in this space,
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.100]   you started somewhere where you didn't
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.100]   and you still had some bumps along the road,
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.940]   but also the success rate overall is pretty high
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.180]   because I think that's important
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.540]   for anyone thinking about this as an asset class.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.580]   But when you talk about buying businesses,
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.420]   you briefly touched on ways to finance things,
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.620]   but I think one of the most interesting things
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.620]   I've learned from you and your content
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.620]   is just that you don't actually have to have $100,000
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.980]   to buy a $100,000 business,
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.820]   which is just like the big unlock that no one knew.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.900]   Can you talk a little bit about
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.260]   or maybe give some examples of why that is true?
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.660]   Because it certainly doesn't seem it.
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.700]   - It's two magic words when you don't have money
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.340]   and that's seller financing,
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.380]   which used to be a thing in real estate.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.980]   You used to be able to sometimes buy a house
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.980]   and from the future profits you got off a rental unit,
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.420]   you could buy that house for $0 down
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.860]   and pay them over time, right?
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.900]   So the seller would finance your purchase.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.540]   Now it's not so normal,
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.180]   but in buying businesses, it's very normal.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.380]   60% of all businesses are bought
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.940]   using essentially the seller's future profits.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.460]   And the reason why is because you've run a business
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.860]   or seven before.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.260]   So how miserable is running a business sometimes?
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.500]   It's tough, right?
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.300]   And so for a lot of these sellers,
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.260]   they've been doing this for 10, 20, 30 years.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.060]   And at some point they're ready for the next thing,
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.900]   even if it's a profitable business,
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.060]   but they're stuck in it because unlike a job,
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.300]   not everybody knows how to exit a business.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.100]   Everybody knows how to leave a company.
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.060]   Not a lot of people know how to sell their company.
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.820]   Not a lot of people know you can even sell your company.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.460]   And so there are a ton of sellers out there
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.260]   who are trapped in their business.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.820]   Most of these sellers do not have enough cash for retirement.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.340]   More than 70% of them do not have a transition plan
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.260]   for the next generation to take over
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.020]   or somebody else to take over.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.260]   And so you come in as a little bit of the solution for that.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.220]   And how that works really quickly, for instance,
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.180]   I always use this one deal
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.900]   'cause it was one of my smaller deals in the beginning,
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.020]   is I bought a laundromat for like 100K a year
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.940]   that did $67,000 in profit.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.420]   So that's one and a half X the profits of the business
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.300]   is how you value these for everybody listening.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.980]   So I buy this laundromat,
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.820]   but I don't use my own cash to do it.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.300]   I tell the seller over a three-year period,
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.700]   I'm gonna pay you back from the profits of the business
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.740]   to take over your business.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.380]   And at the end of three years, great,
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.700]   you have your full 100K.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.940]   And at the end of the three years,
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.020]   I own the business outright.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.100]   And this is very common.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.300]   And I would say it's not always common you get 100%,
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.140]   but it's more common than people think.
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.700]   - So a business costs $100,000,
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.900]   the business is making enough profit to pay for that.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.740]   Like, why is this a good deal for the seller
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.580]   just to get out?
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.860]   It seems like a great deal for you
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.700]   'cause the business pays him back with the profits,
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.860]   you don't spend anything.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.340]   - Yeah, it goes back to the old supply and demand curve.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.860]   When you have a lot of supply and not a lot of demand,
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.380]   then you're in charge.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.180]   There's somewhere around the range
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.820]   of 10 to 12 billion small businesses for sale,
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.740]   and there just aren't enough buyers.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.340]   I mean, there was a great article, actually,
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.420]   we did a video on it, about Japan,
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.820]   and that they have a crisis in business owners
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.540]   starting to give away their business for $0.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.780]   I'm not talking $0 seller financing, I'm talking $0,
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.820]   because the next generation doesn't wanna run
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.420]   a goat herding business,
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.740]   or they don't wanna run a plumbing business.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.740]   And so the founders of the companies just shut them down,
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.140]   or they try to give them away.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.580]   So this is a real thing that happens every day.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.220]   In fact, a lot of people don't think
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.220]   that they have a business.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.500]   They think that they have a job.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.540]   So think about your neighborhood wedding photographer,
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.820]   who also happens to have some contracts
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.140]   for high school photos that they do every year.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.980]   They do $100,000 in revenue a year.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.980]   It's a great little business for them, right?
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.060]   That's their business.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.900]   They do $100,000 a year.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.180]   And when you take out their salary,
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.140]   which at this point they pay themselves the full amount,
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.380]   but let's say you take out their salary of 60, $70,000,
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.420]   that leaves 30 to $40,000 profit.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.140]   That person, when they're done being a wedding photographer
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.940]   and a high school photo photographer,
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.580]   they probably just like stop and go do something else.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.340]   But those contracts with the high schools
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.500]   are worth something,
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.580]   that residual revenue is worth something,
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.900]   their gear is worth something,
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.900]   their website, the SEO that's built up,
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.380]   all of these jobs have inherent value to them.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.700]   And it's just that a lot of people,
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.060]   there's a big mismatch.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.180]   And it's one thing we're working on.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.140]   I'm trying to build right now,
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.500]   as I should talk to you about,
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.300]   but I'm trying to build right now a better mousetrap
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.660]   because there's something called Biz Buy Sell,
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.660]   which is like the Zillow or Redfin
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.900]   of small businesses to buy, except it's awful.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.380]   Like bad UI, UX, a bunch of garbage on there.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.260]   The financials aren't clean.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.380]   They have business brokers that never respond to you.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.540]   It's not a great site,
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.980]   but it's the best of all of the bad, right?
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.540]   And so we're trying to figure out
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:00.140]   how to build a marketplace where sellers can come
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:04.300]   and trust that there's gonna be non-looky-loo buyers on it.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.940]   And we can normalize the information and pair the two,
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.500]   but there's not a lot of that right now.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.860]   So that wedding photographer can't find you,
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.060]   the young new photographer,
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.300]   that would love to buy that business
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.220]   because you, the young photographer, are just thinking,
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.860]   "Oh, I'm just gonna go start my own,"
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.580]   as opposed to, "What if I could buy it?
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.420]   What if I could, instead, when I graduate dental school,
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.460]   what if I could buy somebody's practice
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.740]   and I could give them an annuity in retirement?"
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.740]   I think buying small businesses is the next real estate.
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.860]   And in 10 to 20 years,
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.380]   they'll be completely commoditized and normalized
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.260]   in a way that it is not today.
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.380]   But until then, there's a lot of opportunity.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.260]   If there's not a platform to do it, is it knocking on doors?
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.060]   Is that how you find these businesses
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.300]   in your local community?
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.860]   Well, actually, we bought a company called BidScout,
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:53.100]   BidScout.io, and that company sources off-market deals.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.900]   And so, basically, if you wanna buy a car wash
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.260]   in your geographic area,
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:01.260]   it pulls together all the data from Yelp and Google
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.980]   and business listings and pulls them into one location,
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.580]   also cross-references that with PPP loans
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.220]   so you could try to get to who the owner
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.260]   is in your location and maybe needed some help,
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.540]   and so might be more likely to sell now,
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.340]   and then also pulls this list of proprietary deals we have
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.500]   from having this big audience.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.380]   So BidScout is the one that we wanna build off of.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.620]   It's what I use right now.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.060]   I think the best way to buy a business
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.580]   is different than buying a house.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.740]   It's almost like buying a house back in the day.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.980]   Before realtors, you would be like,
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.540]   "Oh, my friend Sally's selling.
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:32.820]   "You wanna get into the neighborhood?
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.740]   "Like, you should talk to Sally," right?
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.180]   That's like foreign to my generation.
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.780]   Like, we can't even imagine you just buy houses
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.620]   on word of mouth.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.100]   What's wrong with you people, right?
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.260]   But that is actually the best way to buy a small business,
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.260]   is to build up your network
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.500]   or do what I call a personal P&L review,
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.100]   where you look at all of your expenses
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.020]   and you see which CEOs of those companies
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.260]   you could actually get to,
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.260]   and you start nurturing relationships and saying,
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:00.060]   "Oh, man, you guys produced my podcast on all the hacks.
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.020]   "How's that business going?
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.860]   "Is it profitable?
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   "How long have you been doing it?
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.100]   "A while, cool.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.420]   "Is this something you wanna do forever?
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.660]   "You wanna keep running this business?
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.500]   "No, you don't.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.340]   "You're ready for the next thing?
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.180]   "Interesting.
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.220]   "I actually buy small businesses.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.220]   "If you had an offer at the right price
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.060]   "and the right terms,
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.500]   "would you be open to a conversation
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.820]   "on potentially getting acquired
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.260]   "or an investment that comes with distributing equity,
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.620]   "cashflow, something like that?
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.740]   "Oh, you might be interested in that?
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.180]   "Great, now we're in the game."
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.580]   - So you mentioned deal-making earlier
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.500]   being an important skill,
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.740]   and then you just said at the right price
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.700]   and the right terms.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.860]   I think you have a pretty contrarian perspective there
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.660]   that most people think price is the most important,
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.660]   but I think you believe terms are actually more important.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.420]   Can you talk about that?
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.100]   - Only amateurs think price is the most important thing.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.980]   That is something that people egotistically
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.540]   want to put on their Twitter feed.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.660]   I sold for seven figures.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:46.700]   That's awesome.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.260]   Because you know that,
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.380]   you have a great leverage point
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.980]   that you should just poke at.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.020]   The real pros know that terms
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.420]   are the only things that matter.
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.500]   If I was to say to a seller,
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.980]   "Hey, I'll buy your business for $2 million,
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.420]   "which is what you want.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.100]   "I think your business is only worth a million dollars.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.740]   "So here's how we're gonna do it.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.220]   "I'm gonna give you X dollars upfront.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.420]   "And then if your business hits the goals
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.780]   "that you say it's going to hit,
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.220]   "because your business is so great
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.060]   "and it should be worth $2 million,
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.980]   "I will pay you that amount over time.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.420]   "In fact, we can put it in escrow,
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.580]   "we can put it in writing,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.420]   "you can have a clawback provision
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.860]   "if you hit those numbers.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.620]   "But until then, I'm only gonna pay this amount."
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.780]   And so you can say,
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.620]   "Hey, Chris, great.
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.500]   "I'll buy your business for $2 million."
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.140]   But that amount might only end up being 500,000
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.780]   or 750,000 if you structure the deal right.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.020]   That's where the game is.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.540]   That's where like the fun part for me is in deal-making,
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.260]   because you sell a house,
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.220]   there's no wiggle room.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.140]   You're like, "Here's the price.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.500]   "It is what it is."
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.580]   Maybe you get a realtor to skip their commission
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.740]   or you get a better rate,
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.180]   but like that's it.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.380]   Buying a business,
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.260]   you can play as many chords as you want to.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.340]   - It's funny 'cause as you said that,
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.580]   I was like, "I tried to play that game
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.420]   "when I was buying a house,
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.500]   "but at the end of the day,
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.300]   "I got them to throw in some plants,
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.540]   "a TV, and like rebate half a percent of the commission."
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.460]   It's nowhere near the kind of impact you're talking.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.300]   It felt good.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.660]   I'm doing an episode maybe in a month or two
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.420]   about how to optimize the home buying process.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.500]   There are levers there,
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.140]   but they don't sound nearly as opportunistic
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.700]   and awesome as the levers you could play buying a business.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.620]   - I think maybe the key to life and being successful
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.100]   is playing the right games.
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.820]   And if you only have like so many words
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:20.660]   you can say a day,
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.380]   so many hours in the day,
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.180]   where is it worth the negotiating or deal-making
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.300]   and where isn't it?
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.060]   And most people spend their time
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.700]   on really low-level activities,
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.860]   coupon cutting, asking for a discount at a restaurant
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.860]   or for wine or buying furniture, whatever.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.940]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.180]   But instead of doing that,
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.420]   you could just be a little bit more strategic upfront
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.820]   and think about if I negotiated my salary
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.340]   every single year, for sure,
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.740]   but maybe even twice a year, mid-year review time,
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.940]   maybe if you're really good quarterly,
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.820]   I can never clip a coupon again
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.260]   and make more from just negotiating my salary.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.180]   And then a second level from that is,
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.220]   man, if I could figure out how to negotiate,
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.940]   how to buy assets that cashflow
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.780]   and can do 100X or 300X return to me,
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.780]   then I don't even have to negotiate my salary that much
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.140]   because I just take the salary, use the salary,
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.300]   apply it to assets that I keep buying.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.020]   Those keep cash flowing for me.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.140]   So it's all about like, what level are you playing?
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.180]   Lots of people play level one games.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.660]   And I think the pros, they don't bother with that.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.980]   They don't Dave Ramsey their way to millions.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.500]   It's not the fucking Starbucks.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.180]   Have the Starbucks if you want it,
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.500]   but instead try to get really smart
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.980]   on negotiating or deal-making
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.740]   so you can play the level six games
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.220]   and then buy whatever coffee you want.
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.980]   - I feel like I like playing all six levels of games
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.940]   at the same time, which is maybe my problem
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.700]   is I end up spending too much time there.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.380]   But I agree that you could save a little here or there,
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.220]   worry about that.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.580]   But if you're not working on your salary,
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.500]   if you're not working on income,
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.780]   if you're not working on your investments,
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.060]   it's not there.
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.340]   But I think for the right person,
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.020]   getting that Starbucks for free
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.060]   because you played the Starbucks rewards thing
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.420]   and they had a double star day,
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.220]   like it just feels good sometimes.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.780]   So I think that's my challenge is that every now and then
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.660]   knowing that you got this thing for half the price,
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.620]   that satisfaction just kind of like fuels
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.780]   and makes me excited,
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.420]   but I'm not doing it for the money to be clear.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.300]   Like it's a different type of game
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.940]   where it's like really more about enjoyment
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.260]   and satisfaction of what I'm doing day to day.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.140]   But I have realized that as you level that up,
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.940]   it's not about trying to save $2.
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.500]   It's like, how do I apply that principle to something else?
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.380]   I think I've talked a few times about working on this book
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.780]   about principles of optimization in life.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.100]   And part of it is that,
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.820]   it's like, how do you go 80%,
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.340]   get the 80/20 out of optimizing your travel?
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.500]   And then instead of going down the 20,
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.740]   think about what do I care more about?
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.780]   Oh, maybe I care about my health.
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.180]   Let's go do the 80/20 on my health before I go.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.100]   Once you've done all the 80s, sure.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.300]   Go take 10% more on each one.
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.820]   So that's, I think the next level thing
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.660]   that I'm working on just generally
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.500]   and trying to put a little bit more thought behind it
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.140]   because it's a broad topic.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:50.980]   - I love that.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.260]   It's interesting because you're right.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.540]   You play a lot of the points games,
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.460]   which I think are fun and valuable.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.340]   I love a discount.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.380]   I do love a discount.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.340]   I love a deal.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:04.060]   I think I will always, no matter how wealthy I am,
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:08.220]   try to get them to optimize the sides I want on a dish
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.660]   and give me them for free
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.420]   as opposed to add-ons to the dish,
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.740]   which really ticks me off.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.860]   I play that game,
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.700]   but I think the question that I come back to,
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.460]   and I'd be curious your take on,
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.060]   is if we're gonna play these optimizing games,
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.620]   I think a lot of people fuck around
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.860]   and find out these days.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:29.460]   They're like Twitter guys talking about their ice baths
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.380]   and their saunas and these things that have,
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.180]   could you even say a 1% difference?
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.420]   One to 5%.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.660]   Let's be generous and say ice baths and saunas
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.700]   give you a one to 5% better overall health,
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.100]   which I think that would be a lot maybe.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.300]   Even go 10%.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.340]   It's like instead, man, I looked at your profile picture.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.500]   How about you go to the gym five days a week for one hour?
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.420]   And then instead,
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.300]   how about we skip some of the processed food?
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.660]   And a day a week, you try to not do processed food.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.100]   And so I think a lot of people choose the wrong games
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.020]   and they make life way harder than they need to.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.020]   And I do this in many different ways.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.300]   I wanna optimize all these things on the fringes
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.700]   because they seem cool.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.820]   When if you wanna get fit, it's just be more active,
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.260]   eat healthier food, and that's it.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.140]   But instead, we wanna add 37 supplements and 472 podcasts
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:22.180]   and three ice baths before you've fully woken up.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.940]   - It's funny 'cause I was listening to a talk
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.420]   Peter Attia gave and he wrote this really long book
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.260]   that I really enjoyed about life.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.460]   It's called Outlive.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.220]   And someone was saying, if you could just do one thing,
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.100]   he's like, look, almost none of this book matters
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.700]   if you're not just exercising.
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.180]   If you're not exercising, don't even open the book.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.860]   You don't need to do all of these things.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.580]   But if you are exercising and you are eating healthy,
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.860]   the data on sauna is pretty great
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.380]   in terms of longevity and health,
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.860]   but it's nowhere near as good as the data
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.900]   on what it means to just go out and exercise
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.260]   and go on a run or lift weights
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.020]   or whatever form of strength or cardio
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.660]   or zone, whatever you want,
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.660]   that is going to do more than other things.
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.820]   But if you're already doing that,
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.140]   I think decide where you wanna spend your time.
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.020]   If you have a family history of a certain type of illness,
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.500]   okay, what's the thing that might be best
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.540]   at preventing that?
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.860]   Great place to spend time.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.100]   But I agree that if you're not exercising
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.340]   and you're eating like crap,
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.260]   any amount of little tiny optimizations
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.500]   are not the priority to focus on.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.060]   Might make you feel good,
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.700]   but you need to get out and you need to get some exercise
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:21.540]   or stay in.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.580]   I don't care where you do it, but you need to do it.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.420]   - That's so true.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.620]   I have a great friend, John, who's a categorical badass.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.780]   He was in the foreign service.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.860]   He did incredible things for our country.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.060]   He's one of those guys.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.500]   So he basically does a workout
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.900]   and he eats whatever's in front of him.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.500]   And he's this brilliant dude,
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.340]   but he's like, "The thing is
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.540]   "I have to start with ice baths."
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.660]   And I was like, "This is what I know.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.020]   "Twitter's gone too far."
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:41.860]   I think you're right.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.460]   Choose the right games and then optimize for the 10%
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.460]   in everything.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.340]   - I've talked to lots of people about ice baths, cold plunge.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.700]   There's one aspect of it,
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.380]   which is this is a thing that might help my health.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.260]   And compared to exercise, maybe it's not there.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.220]   But there's also the,
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.780]   this is the thing that gets me fired up
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.780]   every day in the morning
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.700]   and makes me feel alert and ready to kick ass
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.620]   on my business, on my work, on my career.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.340]   And so I put those in two camps.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.100]   There's the, this is the thing that recharges me.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.740]   This is the thing that helps me recover
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.380]   from run or whatever it is.
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.820]   And then there's the, will this increase my longevity?
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.900]   If I'm not exercising, maybe no.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.660]   But if that ice bath makes you like pumped for every day
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.740]   and makes you work 10 times harder,
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.780]   by all means, jump right in.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.620]   - I agree.
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.780]   We'll stop beating up the poor ice baths.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.620]   I have one, I use it.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.060]   Sorry, ice bath company that gave me one.
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.220]   I think as humans, if we could really figure out
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.340]   this beautiful secret,
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.700]   which is that we have a finite amount of energy
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.220]   and focus is the only thing that matters
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.140]   if you focus on the right things first,
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.460]   most humans, let's be honest,
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.500]   one out of 10 people in the U.S.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.620]   will die wealthy when they die, one out of 10.
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:54.980]   Everybody else inside of there will largely die broke,
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.900]   will die before the age of 60,
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.180]   will be on government subsidization.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.980]   So sometimes I try to not forget
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.660]   that, man, we have so many different paths in the U.S.,
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.860]   but by and large, we have a lot of people
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.740]   who if we don't overwhelm them,
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.620]   and just like when I was younger
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.780]   and I didn't even know what a mutual fund was
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.860]   and I didn't even know how to not overrun my bank account,
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.900]   but we just make it really easy for them
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.580]   to make one or two good decisions,
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.460]   then everything else gets a lot easier.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.820]   But I'm sure the people on your podcast
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.780]   are doing all the right things.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.860]   So if you guys are here listening,
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.020]   you should probably ice bath and do red light therapy,
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.340]   which I also love.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.180]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.820]   So I wanna go down a handful of paths.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.340]   One, we talked a lot about one aspect
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.300]   of investing that you do,
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.020]   and it's become your core thing.
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:37.860]   When it comes to money,
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.180]   are you still doing any other types?
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.020]   Are you diversified?
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.820]   Or is everything all in on buying businesses?
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.380]   - Yeah, no, I'm diversified.
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.380]   I have like probably a 20% bucket
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.500]   that's stocks, bonds, typical things.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:51.660]   I have a financial advisor
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.460]   that manages all of that for me.
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.860]   I probably have another 20% bucket
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.180]   that's startups, early stage companies,
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.580]   and then the rest are in either real estate
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.180]   or my boring businesses.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.340]   And that's without leverage.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.260]   Obviously, if I applied the leverage
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.620]   that I have to the boring businesses,
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:12.420]   it would be maybe 90%, maybe 100%, basically.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.060]   But if we take leverage off the game,
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.060]   then I probably am like 55, 60%
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.580]   in these cash boring businesses,
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.340]   and the rest of them are in startups or stocks and bonds.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.260]   - And another money thing
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.180]   that I think maybe other people listening,
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.620]   myself included, are thinking is,
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.060]   one of the greatest things about running a business
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.660]   is you have all these business expenses,
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.580]   great opportunity to rack up unlimited number of points,
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.500]   miles, cashback, whatever it is.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.580]   Please tell me that you're like
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.100]   at least playing that game a little.
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.860]   I know you're not as deep as maybe I am,
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.580]   but is that kind of a side benefit
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.260]   to owning all these businesses?
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.500]   - After me talking about all this,
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.540]   I probably should have just a one-on-one call
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.100]   where you could consult me on my points.
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.620]   No, I think if you looked at my Amex,
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.220]   I probably have like millions of points
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.660]   that have never used them.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.660]   And we don't optimize that at all.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.060]   Maybe we optimize a little bit
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.900]   because we have everybody use company cards
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.020]   across all the businesses
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.060]   and those get aggregated in a few different ways,
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.820]   and then we spend some big expenses on that.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.500]   But for the most part,
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.060]   the games that I play with that are taxes.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.060]   So are we buying the right real estate
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:13.020]   that's gonna allow us to do accelerated depreciation,
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:16.100]   amortization, because that could be a huge benefit.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.420]   Are there some businesses where I could acquire them,
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.060]   but I could acquire them like, oh, this is a fun one.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.500]   So I was out there looking for a head of production, right?
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.460]   I needed somebody to produce part of my media company.
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.620]   And I was having a really hard time finding this role
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.660]   and I needed actually a few roles underneath it.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.540]   And I just wasn't having time to hire for it.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.140]   Then I was like, wait, pause.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.820]   What if I could acquire these roles that I need
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.940]   in the form of a business as opposed to hire them?
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.300]   And so I went out to a few vendors
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.340]   and I started working with a few vendors
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:48.420]   and all of those vendors were open to being sold,
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.740]   which will surprise you guys.
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.100]   Almost every single business owner out there
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.940]   is open to being bought at the right price at right terms.
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.740]   And so three of them were open to it.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:57.900]   Two of them, I didn't like the deal.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.620]   One of them, it was perfect timing.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.820]   I had mentioned this to them.
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.140]   They had a little bit of a conflict inside the company.
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:03.980]   And I said to the guy,
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.220]   "Hey, how about if I acquihire you guys?
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.860]   "How about I buy your company
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.180]   "and I'm gonna buy out you four plus your gear.
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.980]   "We'll give you some multiple on that,
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.300]   "but it'll happen after you've been with me for 90 days
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.740]   "and you've been executing and I'll pay you in salary."
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.420]   So through that acquisition,
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:24.160]   I have decreased my overall profits in the business
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.620]   by hiring them with an increased salary,
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.220]   but that is a complete before the line tax write-off.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.860]   Say I acquire all of them for salary of 100K for the year,
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.940]   I can't write off that acquisition
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.860]   dollar for dollar in my business.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.420]   But if I hire all of them through an acquihire
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.700]   and that $100,000 rolls through
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.300]   as an expense payment for payroll,
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.460]   that lowers the total profits in my business
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.100]   and thus decreases my tax bill dollar for dollar.
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.720]   And so that was a cool way
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.060]   that I sort of gamed my little point system.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.700]   But no, I'm terrible at Amex cards
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.900]   and lights and all of that stuff.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.680]   - We're gonna have that one-on-one at some point.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.080]   We're not gonna do it live, but we'll get to it.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.420]   Our partner today is AG1,
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.580]   the daily foundational nutrition supplement
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.300]   that supports whole body health.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.820]   I drink it literally every day.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.860]   And I gave AG1 a try because I wanted an easy way
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.740]   to get my daily nutritional insurance
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.820]   and optimize my immune system.
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.880]   And AG1 has been in my routine for over a year.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.560]   Just one daily serving gives me
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.940]   the comprehensive foundational nutrition I need
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.880]   and supports energy, focus, strength, and clarity
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.660]   with 75 high-quality vitamins, probiotics,
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.700]   and whole food sourced ingredients.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.220]   So it can completely replace
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.700]   your multivitamin, probiotics, and more.
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.780]   Every morning I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.260]   add a few ice cubes because it's so good cold,
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.140]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.600]   and energized for the day,
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.140]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.580]   I also love that AG1 is raising the standard
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.820]   for quality in the supplement category
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.760]   with less than one gram of sugar,
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.340]   no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.

[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:21.460]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.980]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.560]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.220]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.580]   as you build your wealth.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.860]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.720]   Long Angle is a community of high-net-worth individuals
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.860]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.980]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.400]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.800]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.780]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.060]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:51.220]   join me on All the Hacks in episode 87
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.580]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:55.300]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.100]   are first-generation wealth,
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.180]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.300]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.660]   and learn from each other
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.260]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.540]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.860]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.300]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.460]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.420]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.900]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.340]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.980]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.460]   So many of these conversations
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.660]   aren't happening anywhere else online,
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.340]   so if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.180]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.340]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.420]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.580]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,

[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:50.100]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.900]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,

[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.020]   - You also mentioned the most important game
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.700]   is to figure out where you spend your time
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:13.660]   and what you're focused on.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.340]   How do you think about when to spend your time
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.700]   on certain activities or how you spend your time?
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.440]   - I used to be really bad at this,
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.300]   and it's just something I struggle with daily.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.700]   I think I, probably like a lot of entrepreneurs,
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.500]   have mild ADHD.
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.660]   Everything's distracting.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.380]   I have FOMO all the time,
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.820]   and there are a couple things that made a big difference.
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.780]   One is, by and large,
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.980]   we think that technology is going to help us,
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.620]   so we have Tinder and Bumble
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.340]   that would make dating so much easier.
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.500]   The world was going to be better
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.260]   because instantly we would be paired with other humans.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:46.220]   According to some algorithmic match,
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.820]   we would find love, we would find sex,
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:48.700]   we would find meaning.
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.920]   What happened in set?
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.080]   Loneliness numbers at all-time high,
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.140]   people having sex at all-time lows,
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.800]   decreased marriage likelihood,
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.020]   decreased people having children.
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.060]   This technology that was supposed to help us
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.660]   actually seemingly did not,
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.580]   and in fact, through what I think
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:05.040]   is just massive optionality
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.900]   and overwhelm from paralysis by analysis,
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.100]   means that we're not engaging anymore in that way
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:12.740]   from an intimacy perspective.
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.740]   I think a lot of the tech that helps us in business
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.780]   is the same thing.
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.300]   Slack is one of the most useful thing in my business.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.260]   It's also the worst thing in some of my businesses.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.900]   So if you were to look at my calendar, for instance,
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.380]   you would see basically
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:28.980]   that I do not take a phone call before 12 p.m.
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.320]   I would say I'm not 100% of the time.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.940]   I am about 70, 80% of the time.
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.600]   So no calls before 12.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.480]   I am 100% of the time before 10 a.m.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.180]   No phone calls, no mediates.
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.020]   You'll also see that we have in our business,
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.780]   we have reminders that go out on our Slack channel
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.100]   that says, "Are you being productive or are you being busy?"
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.780]   So every so often in the general channel,
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:49.960]   like a thing will come on,
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.340]   and then the people in the companies will be like,
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:52.820]   "Oh, fuck, I am fucking around on Slack.
[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.020]   "I shouldn't be on here."
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:54.840]   That's fine.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.660]   And then actually I met with Bill Perkins,
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.620]   our mutual friend, this last weekend,
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.560]   and he kind of messed with my mind, Chris,
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.260]   because we were meeting,
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.060]   and he wants me to go big in acquisitions and small business
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.820]   and let him invest in my company,
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:08.700]   and I don't let anybody invest in me right now.
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:10.780]   We have all our own cash in it.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.260]   And he's like, "Cody, the thing is this.
[00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.260]   "You have been investing and playing
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.460]   "in small business land for so long.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.680]   "I think small has infected your thinking."
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.980]   I was like, "What?"
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.580]   Like, one, ouch, kind of hurt.
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:27.320]   Two, I rolled it around in my mind for a second and thought,
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.700]   "Huh, he's kind of right."
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.220]   And so I was like, "What do you mean by that?"
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.860]   He's like, "One, you have a portfolio
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.840]   "that does $60 million in revenue.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.900]   "That would be a lot to most people."
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.380]   He goes, "But you have run billion dollar funds before.
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.860]   "Why don't you have a billion dollar?"
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.540]   And then he's like, "Two, how many things do you do
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:46.080]   "throughout the day that are not high-leverage activities?
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:46.920]   "Count them."
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.020]   And my husband was there with me,
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.340]   and so we started naming off a bunch,
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.500]   and I was like, "Shut up,"
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.580]   like elbowing him beneath the table.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.260]   And so really quickly I realized,
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:55.940]   gosh, there are all these things
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.460]   where because I didn't come from money,
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.860]   because I still am always scared that I'm gonna be broke,
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.380]   because I never feel like we're rich
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:03.920]   no matter how much money we have,
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.220]   I keep doing that is really holding me back
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.660]   from getting to the next level.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.100]   And so now I have a question on my computer
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.260]   that says two things.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:13.460]   One is about content.
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.820]   So it says don't ship a product
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.180]   unless it makes you pee a little bit,
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.560]   which means it should be funny, it should entertain you,
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.060]   anything that we go out in media.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.860]   And the second thing basically says long-winded,
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:26.180]   but does this seem important or is this important?
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.300]   So now I try to remind myself of that.
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.500]   Has Bill ever messed with your mind like that?
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.260]   - His whole book kind of messed with my mind
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.140]   'cause I kind of played a little bit
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.780]   in that financial independence, retire early world,
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.780]   it was all about saving.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:40.260]   And we were on a call doing an interview
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:41.100]   and he told me,
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.380]   when you're trying to use all your points and miles,
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:43.540]   you're optimizing for the best deal,
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:45.340]   you're not optimizing for taking the trip.
[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:47.340]   And I left the meeting, went to my wife and I was like,
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.620]   we've always talked about going on a trip for the holidays.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.200]   This year is like the perfect time.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.860]   Who cares whether it's gonna be a lot of points
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.180]   or not a lot of points, let's just do it.
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.440]   The awesome part about that was once I committed,
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.760]   then I still found a way to make a great deal.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.940]   But like, I was afraid the deal wasn't gonna be good
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.540]   'cause it was the holidays, so we weren't gonna do it.
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.820]   So he kind of has really messed with my mind,
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.220]   which is like, make sure you're optimizing
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.040]   for the right thing.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.740]   And for anyone who hasn't listened to the episode
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.340]   I did with him on his book, "Die With Zero",
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:12.740]   go back and find it.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.100]   It was excellent.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.340]   It might be one of, if not the most listened to episode
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.580]   of the show.
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:19.900]   And so he's really messed with me,
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.100]   just like, let's make sure I'm really focused
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:25.140]   on what I want to get out of life in more broad sense,
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.700]   but not in a business sense.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.060]   But what he said about your business,
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.820]   all I could think about when we were talking about renting
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:34.380]   was, well, I understand that real estate is an asset class
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.220]   that could be interesting to invest in.
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.580]   I don't want to be a landlord.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:40.820]   And so I have some percentage of my portfolio in a REIT.
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:44.020]   You have convinced me that these opportunities,
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.660]   these millions of small businesses,
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.140]   buying them and running them, operating them,
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.980]   growing them, buying their suppliers,
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.860]   it's a great place to invest time and energy and money.
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.220]   But I also have my own business and I'm like,
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:56.780]   now is not the time with two small kids to do it.
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:58.740]   What's the REIT of that?
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.060]   And it sounds like the answer is
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.740]   there are like private equity things,
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:04.260]   which are much more up the high net worth
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:05.900]   and in that level of business,
[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.100]   I wonder if there's as much arbitrage
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.180]   as it sounds like you've found,
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:11.900]   but I also don't necessarily want to do it.
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:13.180]   Is there a thing in that space
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:15.420]   or is that what Bill wants you to go do?
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.900]   Well, that is what Bill wants us to go do for sure.
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:21.540]   But private equity funds have varying sizes.
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:25.340]   What I've found is below the $10 million in revenue mark
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:29.020]   is actually where a lot of the meat is still on the bone.
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.340]   Once you get past 10,
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:31.980]   definitely $20 million in revenue,
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.900]   you're more playing with some of the bigger,
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.620]   lower middle market firms
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:38.140]   that are buying up some of these companies.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.260]   But below that, there's just not enough people playing
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:42.500]   because it's riskier and it's harder to scale.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:45.300]   If you think about these companies, KKR, Blackstone,
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.980]   they're not just billions of dollars,
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.940]   they're hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.340]   And it's how much easier is it
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.380]   to allocate $100 million once
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:57.100]   or to 100 deals for $1 million, right?
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:00.660]   The second is categorically harder to scale than the first.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.780]   And so because of that,
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.700]   they go up market bigger and bigger, bigger.
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.220]   It's the same reason why in venture,
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.020]   you saw everybody start doing later stage deals, right?
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:12.300]   Because what, you're gonna put like 525K checks
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.820]   into a brand new company
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.020]   and hope that something pans out, that's a lot of work.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.180]   When instead I could just pick a few companies
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.900]   that are larger later stage
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.100]   and I can allocate a bigger chunk,
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.380]   I could put $20 million in it,
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.260]   I could put $100 million in it.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.100]   And so what we're trying to figure out
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.780]   is there a way to scale the low end of the totem pole?
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.420]   For most people though, they don't care.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.980]   Like for you, you don't care.
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.380]   Can I scale this to 100 million?
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:36.020]   You're like, how do I pick a couple of businesses
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:39.500]   where I can have an operator that runs this business
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.860]   and I just cashflow on it?
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.140]   I'm like the money
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:44.820]   and maybe I'm the counselor once a month
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.420]   or I'm a strategic advisor quarterly.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:48.940]   And that's the real game.
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.620]   So for people who already have a business like you,
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.980]   I would do a couple of things.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.060]   If I was to tell you, Chris Hutchins,
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.180]   what sort of business should you invest in right now?
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:00.140]   I would say, Chris, take your businesses today
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:02.100]   and look at all your expenses.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.420]   Look at every single thing that costs you money each month.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.180]   Just throw it in an Excel spreadsheet,
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.540]   categorize it by who the vendor is,
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.420]   get rid of the majority, right?
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:14.500]   So let's call it 60% of the costs are like Amazon,
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:18.060]   Riverside, like stuff that you can't buy, right?
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.580]   So you're gonna get rid of all those.
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.860]   And then you're gonna be left with 20 to 30 to 40%
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:25.140]   and you're gonna get rid of all the repeat transactions,
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.420]   which means you're probably gonna be down
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:29.620]   to like 10 to 50 different companies.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.780]   And in those 10 to 50 different companies,
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.340]   you're gonna look at them and go, oh, you know what?
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:39.340]   I spend $50,000 a month on PPC on ads
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.900]   that I give my vendor for ads.
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.180]   But I have a podcast that gets hundreds of thousands
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:46.500]   of listens, right, a month.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:50.940]   And I have a bunch of friends who use paid ads.
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:53.620]   So what if I go to this guy and say, here's the thing.
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:55.060]   I really like you.
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.180]   Are you gonna continue to run that?
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.620]   And you do that thing that I said to you.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.060]   You would say like, would you ever sell the business,
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:57:59.900]   I don't know.
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:00.900]   Most likely this guy's young
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:02.820]   because paid ads business is newer.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.380]   So this person's probably a little younger.
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.460]   They're not ready to sell.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:07.580]   And so instead you go, hey, how about this?
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:08.980]   I'm gonna partner with somebody.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:13.980]   I'm going to invest in the form of financial return
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:18.140]   that I give you by talking about you on my platform
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.460]   in somebody's paid ads company.
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:21.500]   I'd like it to be you.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:22.760]   I really like working with you.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.460]   I like us paying you $50,000 a month.
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:26.900]   And I think that I could probably get you
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:29.620]   another $200,000 a month in paid.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.180]   Would you be interested, if we set it up right,
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.580]   it works out perfectly for you.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.060]   I get the right terms for you.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.380]   Would you theoretically be interested in partnering
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:40.340]   where I do some deal, where I take a portion of equity
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.660]   in your company, but that equity distributes
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:44.280]   as a portion of revenue.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.500]   So I'm not gonna be messing around,
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.820]   trying to figure out what your profit is,
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.280]   bothering you in the daily.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.060]   I'm just gonna say, talk line.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:53.380]   I'm gonna take a percentage of total revenue that we make,
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:54.620]   and you're gonna send it to me.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.460]   Just like you would send me a rent check
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:57.460]   if I was a landlord.
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:59.100]   Would you be open to something like that?
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.740]   What you're gonna find is like,
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:01.840]   honestly, I have a high record,
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.900]   but somewhere between one to four people
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.420]   that you talk to out of five
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.180]   will be interested in that deal.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.340]   And you're gonna structure a deal
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:13.100]   where you start to own a portfolio of small businesses
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:17.220]   in chunks because you have a platform that can distribute,
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.180]   and also because you've figured out
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:21.180]   how to get distributing equity deals.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.360]   That's what I would do if you,
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.160]   I wouldn't go out and buy a car wash,
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.820]   unless alternatively you have your wife
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.860]   who doesn't wanna work 40 hours a week,
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:32.260]   but she would love like a five, 10 hour a week thing
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.540]   that could be hers, that she could make her own money.
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.780]   She could do it her way.
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.020]   Then you could buy a small business too.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.900]   - I think my wife is more of a business mercenary than I am.
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:43.140]   She would be like, let's go buy 50 businesses
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.340]   and I will run that empire.
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.420]   Maybe that's the path.
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:47.180]   But if someone doesn't own a business,
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:49.540]   in real estate, there's like these private real estate deals
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.820]   where you can go in and instead of buying a unit,
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:53.540]   there's a developer doing this.
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.780]   Does that stuff exist in businesses?
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.900]   Like when you buy businesses,
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:58.780]   do you ever get financing outside?
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.740]   I think you said no, but do other people like you do that?
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:02.580]   - Yeah, totally.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:03.540]   I don't do it right now.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.100]   I use all my own cash, but there are search funds.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:09.020]   Those are typically people pull together assets
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.540]   and then find an operator who wants to buy a business.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.020]   And that operator goes and buys a business
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.100]   and he has pooled funds.
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.060]   People raise independently for buying businesses.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.180]   Part of the reason that I started a mastermind group
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.500]   where we talk about all that said unconventional acquisitions
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.820]   is because I invest in my people's deals.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.020]   We have 600 members in there.
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:30.300]   The average person buys a business inside of 11 months
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.220]   that does at least $250,000 in revenue.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.900]   I invest in a bunch of those deals.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.820]   So I invest in their one-off deals.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.460]   I invest in pooled funds like search funds.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.500]   And then there are certainly like micro PE funds
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.860]   that'll take, the problem is you really need 25K
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.120]   at least to do that.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.140]   And a lot of them have 100K minimums.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.620]   But when you're raising for one-off deals, those don't.
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.780]   The other nice part about this is these distribute.
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:57.300]   When you invest in a VC fund or an angel investment,
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.480]   eight out of your 10 deals, you're gonna lose money on.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.780]   And you're not gonna get your money
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.700]   for at least five to seven years,
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.580]   but more likely 10, right?
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:05.940]   And so this one's a little different.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.500]   I like doing deals where I cashflow within the first 30 days
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.700]   but I'll sell for 90.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.100]   - So it sounds like find the places
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.820]   like the community you've built where people are doing this.
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.920]   And I think this is the answer
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.700]   for almost any type of industry business
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.820]   that you wanna get into.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.660]   It's go find where the people are talking,
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:23.380]   whether it's a meetup, whether it's a forum,
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.420]   whether it's a mastermind and just start talking
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.020]   and you will slowly build the relationships you need
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.820]   to find ways to get into this.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.700]   And maybe you'll just decide,
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.860]   oh, this is something I wanna do
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.620]   or I met someone, they love doing it.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.220]   I can invest in their next deal.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.060]   - Yeah, 100%.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.740]   And I really just think it's such a skill.
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.020]   I was talking to a guy who owns maybe one
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:43.500]   of the largest fitness companies in the country today.
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.260]   And he's like, I don't even know
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.460]   if I know how to buy businesses.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.940]   This guy does almost a billion dollars in annual revenue.
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.140]   I'm like, it's not that hard.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.620]   What is it that scares you
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.620]   or why don't you think you could do this?
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:58.500]   And his comment was, well, I've grown so fast organically,
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.980]   it feels scary to me to take my eye
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:04.340]   off the thing I do every day to try this other thing.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:05.660]   And I think that's the other biggest reason
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.340]   why people don't buy businesses
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:09.420]   because you feel like I don't wanna take my eye
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.780]   off podcasting and my business
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.100]   and everything that's working right now, it's a distraction.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:16.260]   And that is true often if you feel like you're playing,
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:20.260]   let's call it a level six game, a really high level game.
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.140]   But if you're in a job you don't love,
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.220]   if you're making the same amount of money continuously,
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.980]   I think you should spend at least 90 days learning
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.460]   how to acquire things because then you'll never have
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.220]   to do something just for the money again.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.900]   You can do it if you want to.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.100]   I don't think everybody should go
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.980]   and be a laundromat owner forever.
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.980]   And that's their highest and best use.
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.580]   But I think if you have assets behind you,
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.100]   then you get to choose, you don't have to do.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.940]   Super interesting.
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.780]   It's something I'd never considered
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.020]   until I ran across your content,
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.580]   which is like, we have to have this conversation
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.940]   'cause I just wanted people to know about it.
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.020]   We briefly went over life.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.020]   You talked about your calendar, about how you spend time.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.340]   Are you a big fan of outsourcing a lot of things
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.740]   to team members, assistants, that kind of stuff?
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.940]   How do you, on the personal side, manage your time
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.300]   and not get caught up in kind of those small questions
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.460]   and focus on what's most important?
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.980]   This one I've always been pretty good at.
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.620]   I think I read "The 4-Hour Workweek."
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:17.020]   I think I read that like way too early almost.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.100]   I was like, "I shall outsource everything."
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.340]   But I read that really early and I've tried to live it.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.300]   It's actually helped a ton.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.060]   So I've had a VA since I made like my first 100K.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.860]   The second I hit 100K, I was like,
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.420]   "Hire a virtual assistant."
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:30.460]   And now I have a few virtual assistants.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:32.340]   And then I have an assistant
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.340]   that manages the virtual assistants.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.900]   And then I have my chief of staff
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.940]   who all of them report into.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.580]   The key though, I think, in delegation
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.500]   is realizing that you can only really have,
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:48.500]   in my opinion, five, max 10 people report to you directly.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.300]   I think once you get past that 10 direct reports,
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:54.300]   even if the direct report is your nanny,
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:58.540]   your housekeeper, your property manager,
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.060]   you need those to funnel up.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.820]   And so one thing people don't talk about enough
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.300]   in delegation, I think,
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.860]   is that you have to have an org chart
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:07.700]   for the people that help you even.
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:08.940]   This is a higher level game.
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.860]   This is for people who have some disposable income
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.300]   that they can use.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.460]   If I was you,
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.940]   I actually think the easiest thing to do with delegation
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.540]   is if you can afford to start with a chief of staff.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.380]   So like a higher level person,
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.260]   maybe you're paying that person.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.860]   You could get a young, hungry person for like 65K a year
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.540]   all the way up to chief of staffs
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.860]   can make hundreds and hundreds of thousand.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.700]   And that person can be your go-to contact for a VA
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:36.900]   that only costs you a thousand bucks a month.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.780]   And for your housekeeper
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.420]   that only costs you 400, 500 bucks a month,
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.860]   but they all go through this one person.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:45.340]   That's really the key
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.420]   because the thing stopping you
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.860]   from getting where you're going
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:53.060]   is typically you don't have enough people working for you.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:58.060]   Your 100% can never be as powerful as five people's 50%.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:02.220]   So it's a fallacy that if you're great at something,
[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:04.060]   you're the only person who can do it.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:07.100]   And simultaneously, those five people with 50%
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.980]   will distract you hugely.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.620]   So how can you put a barrier between the two?
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:14.460]   I do that well now, but I haven't always.
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.860]   - I have never done it well.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.980]   And in the last two weeks, maybe,
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.780]   I'm very early in this experiment, I hired a VA,
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.580]   but I would say based on two weeks,
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.660]   I feel like this person falls in the spectrum
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:28.060]   of like VA to chief of staff,
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.980]   like way more qualified than just,
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.940]   I'm gonna send an email to this person.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.780]   And they could do the full spectrum.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:34.900]   And this is early.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:37.580]   And I worked with a company called oceansxyz.com.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.500]   Feel free to tell them.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.460]   Maybe go to allthehacks.com/oceans.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:43.220]   And before you hear this, I'll go get some deal.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.060]   That's my plan.
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:45.700]   So go to allthehacks.com/oceans
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.980]   and we'll see what I can do.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:50.420]   But it has been so interesting to try
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.380]   and really force that.
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.820]   And I wanna do a whole episode on outsourcing things.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.380]   And this is not just work.
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.340]   Like this is personal.
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:01.260]   This is everything from email to meal planning
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:02.940]   to researching.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.980]   But what I did was I started in advance
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.860]   of let's go and write down for like two weeks
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.020]   everything I could outsource.
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.220]   So similarly, as I was going through anything,
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.060]   I would just got in my mind.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:13.900]   Okay, could this go out?
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.100]   Okay, I'm putting a list.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.540]   Once I saw the magnitude of that list,
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.540]   if you think about the cost of hiring virtual assistants,
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:22.700]   you said it could be anywhere from one to $4,000 a month
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:24.260]   for a full-time person.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.260]   And there are other options
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.620]   if you want fractional and all that stuff.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.940]   Imagine what you could do with that,
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.140]   whether it's spending it just with your family
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:34.660]   or on really big strategic things with your business
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:38.500]   or maybe you don't have time to buy a small business
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.340]   like you just heard us talk about
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.540]   because you have so much stuff going on
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.580]   in your personal life.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.180]   What if you could outsource a lot of that personal life stuff
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:47.220]   so that you could go and buy a small business
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:50.020]   and end up finding out that this all pays for itself.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.300]   Now you can roll that person's compensation
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.540]   into that small business.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:56.020]   Now it's a deductible expense above the line.
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:57.420]   There's all kinds of interesting stuff.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.900]   But I am going to do a whole episode
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:03.140]   on this kind of process of everything we've organized
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.300]   and how it worked and how I looked
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.220]   and all the companies that I interviewed.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.420]   Fancy Hands was by far the worst option
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.020]   for outsourcing tasks.
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.740]   I can do nothing more than wholeheartedly tell you
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.060]   do not use this company.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.820]   It was an awful experience.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.780]   - Really?
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:20.060]   - It was task-based VA and it was so bad.
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.820]   A waste of money, completely zero value.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.820]   Sorry, Fancy Hands.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.020]   Unfortunately, completely not satisfied.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.500]   But I'm incredibly satisfied
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.460]   with the woman I'm working with from Oceans
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:34.500]   and it's early, but so far I am so optimistic.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.300]   - I have this friend, Dan,
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.740]   who runs a company called My OutDesk.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.740]   It's another one of those companies you just talked about,
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.940]   but they do something called like the Notepad Challenge.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.500]   I gotta find this for you.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.660]   But basically he had me do the same thing.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:49.900]   The long and short of it is,
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.380]   and I'll find it so you can link it,
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:55.020]   basically you track for an entire day
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.660]   every single activity that you do.
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.860]   And then he says that for a week after,
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.380]   for an hour a day,
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.740]   you should track all of your activities that you do.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:06.220]   And then you catalog them along a quadrant.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:10.300]   And to the left, it's high leverage, low time.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.660]   And on the bottom, it's low leverage, high time.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.420]   So the bottom would be the worst.
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.300]   It's something that takes me a ton of time
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.660]   and it doesn't have a great outcome for me.
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.140]   And at the top, it takes not a lot of time
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.900]   and it's a great output for me.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.980]   And the goal is basically you wanna spend all your time
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:29.700]   in the left quadrant at the top,
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.260]   very little of your time in the bottom right.
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.980]   So you wanna outsource all of those tasks.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.460]   And then there'll probably be another quadrant
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:39.180]   right next to it that's like high output, lot of time.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.820]   So you're spending all of your time in the top two
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.060]   and the bottom two quadrants,
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.140]   you're basically trying to offload all of those tasks.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.260]   And so every so often I go back
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.580]   and do this version of the Notepad Challenge
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.980]   and it's really, really helpful.
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:53.820]   In the beginning, you do what you can afford.
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.740]   And then you layer on top of it.
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.500]   There's a saying, I can't remember who said it,
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.220]   but that you are one hire away
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:00.860]   from a completely new business.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.340]   And I think that's true also for your life.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.180]   Like you are one hire away
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.460]   from a completely different life.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.460]   And it can be very small thing.
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:10.540]   It's like, I can't remember the last time
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.980]   I had to get on the call with AT&T or Verizon
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:17.300]   or deal with a cable provider or schedule my doctors.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:20.860]   Six years ago, I spent hours on that stuff,
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:25.260]   haggling, dealing with issues, changing flights.
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.860]   I don't do any of that anymore.
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.340]   And it probably costs me about a thousand bucks a month
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:32.940]   to save me tens and tens of hours a month.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:33.820]   And it's not just hours.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:36.260]   It's like the overhead of having to keep track
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:37.620]   of all of the things.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.540]   So I'm a huge fan of that.
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:40.860]   We're almost out of time.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:42.300]   I'm gonna ask you one more thing.
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:44.940]   You have all of these great posts and threads
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:45.780]   where you're like,
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:48.220]   here's the way I've optimized this aspect of my life.
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.580]   I'm gonna mention one
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:50.900]   and I'll just link to it in the show notes,
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:52.980]   which is this 160 rule on Sundays
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.020]   about how you ask yourself
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.380]   and check in on what you're doing.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.580]   I think it's great.
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.820]   But the one that I was most recently looking at
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.940]   that's a bit of a tangent from this conversation
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:03.180]   was about a check-in you do on your relationship.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:05.300]   And so I think maybe as a total aside
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:06.780]   from everything we've talked about,
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.980]   maybe share that a bit because I adopted it.
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.260]   I thought it was so great.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.500]   Oh, that makes me happy.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.620]   I had no idea this would go as viral as it did.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.980]   It's just what we do.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:15.820]   We're busy.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.980]   My husband works a lot too.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.420]   He's a pretty serious guy, former Navy SEAL,
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:21.780]   sort of a tough dude.
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:25.100]   And what was happening is we were building up tension
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:25.940]   throughout the day.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.260]   So like little things,
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.580]   why are your socks out?
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.100]   Why didn't you put the car keys away?
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:34.300]   Very small things would get blown out of proportion
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.340]   or they would just nag throughout the day.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.740]   So we came up with this thing
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.500]   in partnership with this woman called Brandy
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.260]   who helped us called Team.
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:42.500]   And basically what it is,
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.700]   it's an end of day check-in.
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.260]   And our goal is the little things
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:48.700]   that come up throughout the day,
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.260]   instead of just word-vomiting them at each other
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:53.460]   at any given point in which you feel annoyed
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:54.580]   and you're elevated,
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:55.900]   what if you wrote them down
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.300]   and you save them for later
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.740]   in a place where maybe you're having a nice glass of wine
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.220]   or for you biohackers out there,
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:03.300]   you're doing whatever you do in the evening
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.580]   and you sit down with your spouse.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.140]   The first tenet is touch.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:08.700]   So T for touch.
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.700]   And it basically means you sit next to each other,
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.620]   you hold hands,
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.660]   you put your feet on each other on the couch, whatever.
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:14.780]   Or when you're really mad,
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:17.700]   we jokingly do this little E.T. one-finger touch thing.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.780]   'Cause sometimes at the end of the day,
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.820]   you're still mad from what's going on.
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.900]   And you start with touch
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:23.260]   because you're reminding each other,
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.060]   you guys are in this together, you're a team.
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:27.180]   The second step is education.
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:28.740]   So you know how you come home from work,
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:29.580]   a lot of times you're like,
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.420]   how was your day, honey?
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.260]   Good, how was your day, honey?
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.660]   Blah, blah, blah, same conversation.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:33.660]   You don't get that deep.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.420]   And that I think really leads
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:38.140]   to why a lot of people actually get divorced
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.300]   or cheat or whatever.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.220]   You stop dating your spouse
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:44.020]   and you stop getting the most interesting information
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:46.460]   out of them because your routine has meant
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.740]   that you ask the same lazy questions always
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:50.940]   and you tell lazy stories.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.580]   And so education means you have to tell your spouse
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:56.540]   one thing that you learned that day that was new to you.
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.220]   And so that means it's usually a great conversation starter.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:01.620]   So like the education part will usually go longer.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.180]   So I might be like, today I was with Chris
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:07.620]   and I just realized that we have a million points on Amex
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.140]   and now I'm super stressed because we have never used these.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.300]   And so now I have to figure out how to optimize this.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.780]   And did you know that there's a whole group of people
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:15.420]   that this is all they do and we're not doing it?
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.860]   And so maybe that's my thing.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.300]   And then he'll tell me something.
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.780]   And then the next is appreciation.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.580]   So even when you're mad,
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:24.780]   there is a reason why you chose this human to be with
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:27.100]   for life, for now, for whatever.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.620]   And so giving a little piece of gratitude
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.780]   typically helps diffuse what comes next.
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.820]   If you're mad, it could be,
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:35.780]   I appreciate you taking out the trash today.
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:38.020]   Our only rule there is you can't keep repeating
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.020]   the same ones.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.780]   You're so beautiful, I love your hair.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.500]   No, you gotta get a little bit more creative.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.780]   And then the last one is metrics.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:46.980]   And here we basically say,
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:49.100]   well, I kept my list of things that annoyed me today
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.700]   that I wish you would do differently.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.500]   Or here's this big thing that I want us to talk about.
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.460]   Or some days we really have nothing.
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:59.060]   But because you're not telling the person in the moment
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:01.620]   when you're upset at them about this thing,
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:06.620]   the level of intensity, emotional intensity is so decreased
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.660]   that typically we get through the metrics
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:10.900]   in a way where we're in our rational brains,
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.540]   we're not elevated so we can have a really
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.100]   pretty easy conversation.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.540]   And then the internet has actually changed up
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:20.460]   this one a little bit and they now think it is teams.
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:23.380]   And at the end, it should be S for sex.
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:24.460]   And that's how you should add it.
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:28.380]   So up to you, that's an optional add-on at the end.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.740]   So I know that was a departure,
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.420]   but I think you have a few of these.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:32.820]   I'm gonna link to a couple of the other ones
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:33.820]   that you've done where you've just like,
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.020]   hey, here's the way I've optimized this thing in my life.
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.540]   And what I love about having conversations with people
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:42.060]   that have thought very deeply about one area of their life
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.420]   is that they've generally actually done that other places.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.020]   You create content, so it's a little easier,
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.020]   but the hardest thing for me is pulling it out.
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.300]   Maybe before you made that post,
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.620]   you said you didn't think it would go viral.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:51.940]   Well, it's just a thing I do.
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.500]   It's like, no, you've applied all these lessons
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.220]   you've learned about business relationships
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:58.460]   and tracking things and trying to find this way.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.100]   Oh, let's just apply it to this relationship.
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.980]   And it turned out amazing.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:03.380]   Not to say just this relationship,
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:05.340]   the most important relationship, of course.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.180]   So that was awesome.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.060]   Thank you for sharing that.
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.540]   I'll link to the rest.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.980]   We're way over time.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:12.300]   Where can people go and learn more
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.100]   about everything you're doing in your community,
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:17.580]   about buying businesses, follow you, everything?
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:20.380]   Hey, contrarianthinking.co is probably the best,
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.220]   or I'm Cody Sanchez on all the socials.
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.060]   Take your pick.
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.260]   The free newsletter comes out weekly and is awesome
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:27.540]   if you wanna learn two things,
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:31.660]   mental frameworks and you wanna learn monetary frameworks.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.580]   So how to make money and how to think better.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:35.540]   That's Contrarian Thinking's newsletter.
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:36.380]   Awesome.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:37.860]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.700]   Oh, thank you for having me.
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:39.660]   This was a blast.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:40.860]   Gotta get my points now.
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:44.740]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:46.500]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.620]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:51.380]   for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:53.100]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.540]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:56.940]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:15:01.220]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:02.260]   That's it for this week.
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:03.420]   I'll see you next week.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.340]   (electronic beeping)
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:12.420]   (electronic buzzing)
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:15.180]   (birds chirping)
