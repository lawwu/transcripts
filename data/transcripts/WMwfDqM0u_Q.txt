[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Is John Piper popular because he makes Christianity look intelligent?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.120]   It's an interesting question, one I certainly did not see coming, but one that has now arrived
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.200]   in the inbox from a listener named Jean.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.680]   "Dear Pastor John, hello and thank you for your incredible ministry to the world.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.680]   I was recently watching a few atheists online go back and forth trying to answer this question,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.840]   why is John Piper so popular?"
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.360]   As you can imagine, the interchange proves that none of them really know you or the gospel
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.360]   you preach.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.700]   Nevertheless, one point from their comments back and forth did strike me.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.760]   One of these atheists said, and the others quickly agreed, that your popularity is owing
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.520]   to the fact that you make Christianity look intelligent.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.520]   That's an interesting point.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.080]   I'm wondering how much you think this is true.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.740]   I think we can all name ample examples of Christians online and on television that do
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.080]   and say really dumb and immature things, but you actually do make Christianity look appealing
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600]   to the intelligent.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.940]   What concerns would you have for the people who do follow you because you make Christianity
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.800]   look smart?
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.520]   The first thing to say is that we need clarity on the meaning of popularity.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.920]   Every listener must be aware after 30 seconds of thought that John Piper is not popular
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:43.480]   because in those 30 seconds, they would surely realize that he is totally unknown to 99.87%
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.480]   of the world's 7.5 billion people.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.480]   You might say, "Where in the world did you get that number?
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.480]   99.87.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.480]   Well, here's what I did.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.920]   I speculated wildly it would be a huge stretch, I think, to say that 10 million people have
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.840]   heard of John Piper and 10 million is 0.13% of the world's population.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.080]   If you wanted to quibble and be crazy and run that number up to 20 or 30 or 40 or 50
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.040]   million people have heard of John Piper, which I think would be absurd, that means that,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.160]   what, 93% of the world population has never heard of John Piper.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160]   So, let's make sure we get the picture right here.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.560]   Piper is a non-entity, non-entity for 7.3 billion human beings on this planet.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.500]   So, not popular, not popular among those and I'd say 7.3 billion is a pretty representative
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.040]   group on the planet.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:52.280]   And I'm going to my grave, get this now, I'm going to my grave a global nobody just like
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.280]   you.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:02.760]   And 99.9999% of everybody else in the world is going to their grave as a global nobody
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.600]   and we better get used to it and remind ourselves it is better.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.360]   Oh my, oh my, 10 million times better to be known by one person, God Almighty, than to
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.320]   be known by 7.5 billion people.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.600]   So that's the first thing to say and we better say it loud and clear.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:31.680]   So the real question our atheist folks are asking evidently is why in this teeny weeny
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.120]   little evangelical pond does this fish named Piper get the attention he does?
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.600]   And they speculate, well, it's because he makes Christianity look intelligent, meaning
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.800]   his audience is gullible, he's a shyster.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.300]   Because of course, every atheist knows Christianity is not intelligent.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.560]   So their answer is evangelicals are fools and Piper's a magician.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.160]   Well, I don't think evangelicals are fools and I don't think I'm a magician.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.080]   So what's my take on their observation that I'm able to put the Bible in the black hat
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.280]   and pull out the rabbit of intelligence?
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.520]   And my take is this, the most intelligent person in the universe is not an atheist,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.000]   he's God.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.600]   And he wrote a book called the Bible.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.200]   So the author of the Bible sees and knows all reality perfectly, understands its makeup
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.240]   and connections flawlessly and completely, evaluates the relative worth of everything
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.040]   with impeccable accuracy in accord with the way reality really is, and arranges it all
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.840]   with infinite wisdom and goodness and justice, and that's who the author of the Bible is.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.300]   Now suppose I ask, say, a relatively thoughtful ninth grader who's never heard of the Bible
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.000]   to take that description that I just gave of the author of the Bible, okay, go home
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.980]   now and write me one paragraph that makes sense to you of the kind of book you would
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.960]   expect from an author like that.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.480]   And I think he would come back with a paragraph something like this.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:21.700]   The book, he says in his ninth grade twang, the book would be about reality and wherever
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.840]   it describes reality, it would do so perfectly because the author knows all reality and he's
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.280]   good and just, so he's not going to try to deceive you.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.080]   He doesn't have to put everything he knows in the book, I suppose, but what he puts in
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.700]   the book will be true, a true picture of reality.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.460]   And when the book talks about other parts of reality, the author puts in and describes
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.020]   the makeup and the connections among all the parts of reality, his description will be
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.400]   flawless.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.420]   And when he evaluates things in the book, he shows us what they're really worth, he
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.980]   doesn't mislead us about what actions and things are valuable and what are worthless
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:19.180]   or harmful, and the book would give the wisest description of how everything works and how
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.660]   everything works together, at least everything that the author includes.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.120]   He'd say something like that, this ninth grader, I think.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.660]   And I would say to the ninth grader, "Right, right, me too."
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:37.820]   That's what I think the book would be like if it had an author like that.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:46.060]   So what would happen if a person, say, who can't read very fast and so is not very
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.820]   widely read and doesn't have a very good memory and doesn't even have a television
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.820]   to give him some cultural creds and has failed to win over some of the people most precious
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:12.300]   to him, what would happen if he spent 50 years marinating his mind and heart in that book?
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:21.220]   And while he was soaking his mind in the tub of that book, he was taking every soaked and
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.940]   juicy fragment floating around him, he would take them and he would get them in his hands
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:34.700]   and he would twist them and squeeze them and pull on them and bite on them and suck on
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.440]   them and press them against each other.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:46.940]   What might happen if he comes up out of that tub, still dripping with truth and still a
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:56.340]   bit drunk with the sweetness of it all and still starstruck by the glories in those fragments
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:05.220]   he was squeezing and he stumbles into a pulpit and start talking about what he just saw and
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.900]   felt, what might happen?
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.460]   Well, I'll tell you what happens.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:16.340]   A few thousand people think he's lost his bearings and a few thousand people say, "Give
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.500]   me more.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.140]   Tell me more."
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:29.060]   And of those few thousand who want more, I would guess, it's just a guess, not one
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.220]   in a hundred would say, "I want to hear more because he's smart."
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.380]   No, that's not it.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:46.460]   I think they say, "I want to hear more because when he talks, I meet the author of the book."
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:54.860]   This poor fellow dripping in front of me is getting smaller and God is becoming bigger.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.860]   That's my guess.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.860]   Very descript.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.340]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.260]   Is there a more foundational or important question in all of creation?
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.840]   I can't think of one.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.420]   So who is God?
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.460]   That question is up next on Wednesday.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.260]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:39.780]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.780]   [END]
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.780]   1. What is God?
