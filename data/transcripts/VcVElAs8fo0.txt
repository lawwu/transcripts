[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060]   When I ask people what is their rich life, I have never, ever gotten someone saying,
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.440]   I want to sit around all week and optimize the price of printer paper.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.500]   Not once, ever.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.560]   And yet they spend literally hours per week doing it.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.380]   When I ask them what is your rich life, they will always say things like spending more time
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.600]   with my family, traveling, new experiences, just going out with my partner and going out
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.120]   for a date night.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.960]   One of the, I think, core principles here is to really get honest about what your rich
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.340]   life is.
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.400]   Your rich life does not have to be what mine is.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.420]   In fact, it never will be.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.560]   Ours are going to be completely different.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.280]   That's how it should be.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.760]   But then once you know what your rich life is in crystal clear clarity, you ask yourself
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.100]   the questions, get your partner involved.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.840]   Then you look at what you're actually spending your time and money on.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.480]   Wait a second.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.700]   Am I actually aligned with what my vision is?
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.760]   You know, we claim we want to travel, but the last time we traveled was like six years
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.960]   ago.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.020]   What's going on here?
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.960]   We claim we want to be more in touch with our family, but when was the last time we
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.740]   actually spent money and time seeing them?
