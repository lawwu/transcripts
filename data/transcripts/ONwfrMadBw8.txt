[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   So today, I want to tell you the story of the singer Jewel and how she became famous.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.320]   Not because this story is fascinating, though it is, but because it highlights a key principle
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.800]   from my book, Slow Productivity, about how to move your professional life away from busyness
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.640]   and toward producing results that matter. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell Jewel's story
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.440]   and then I'm going to draw concrete lessons from her story that you can apply in your specific job.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.280]   I'll give you specific examples about how you might put these lessons into practice. I'll end
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.200]   with a couple of common pitfalls that afflict a lot of people who attempt to escape busyness
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.680]   and fail to do so. All right, so let's start with Jewel. Jewel has an interesting origin story. I
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.720]   went deep on this when researching Slow Productivity just because I found it fascinating.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.000]   She grew up in rural Alaska, Homer, Alaska, to be more precise, and she was part of a family
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   that were traveling musicians. So she was part of a family traveling musician troupe.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.560]   They have Swiss heritage, so she learned how to yodel at an early age, which actually gave her
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.360]   really interesting vocal control, which she really leveraged, I think, later on in her style.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.880]   At some point, her mom leaves the family, so it's just her and her dad and her brother,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.760]   and they're touring, and they're touring some pretty rough places. These are not
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.760]   the Von Trapp family singers. We're talking biker bars. We're talking rural interior Alaska
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.440]   doing shows. We're talking not so great hotels, right? So she sort of had this rough upbringing.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.800]   There's a part in her story where she's living in Homer, Alaska, and commuting to her job in town.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.560]   She lived in a cabin by a lake somewhere. She commuted to her job in town on a horse.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.720]   She didn't have a driver's license, and a horse was an easier way to get over the rough terrain,
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.120]   right? So this is Jewel, this prodigious singer in this really unusual, rough childhood.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:06.080]   So in the town of Homer, she comes across someone who is visiting from the Interlochen Academy. This
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.240]   is a really well-known arts academy in Michigan, and he recognizes her talent and says, "Look,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:20.000]   we have scholarships. You should come formally study how to sing at this arts academy. I'll show
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.720]   you how to do it. I'll record your audition tape, and I'll walk you through the application process."
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.400]   This was all foreign to Jewel, and he walks her through, and she gets accepted. They raise money
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.280]   in the town. They don't give you money. You have to raise money just to get the plane tickets
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.200]   to get to Michigan to go. It's a beautiful academy. It's spread out over this big
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.280]   acreage. You sort of walk through the woods between buildings. It's a beautiful place.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.720]   She shows up there, fish out of water. It's an understatement. Almost immediately, the dean calls
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.480]   her into his office and says, "Jewel, you can't walk around with a hunting knife strapped to your
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.840]   leg." See, to Jewel from rural Alaska, of course, you're going to have a knife with you. It's very
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.280]   useful. You wouldn't be anywhere without your knife, and he had to sort of kindly tell her,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.160]   "All right, here in suburban Michigan, you don't walk around with a large knife strapped to your
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.560]   leg." Anyways, she gets formal training. She becomes a better singer. She becomes more exposed
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   to music. She can't afford to go home during the breaks, so she begins hitchhiking, doing these
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.480]   long trips during the breaks with her guitar, and she begins songwriting. She begins to write
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.720]   some songs that become some of her best-known songs from her initial debut album that will
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.520]   come much later, right? So we have this interesting story. She makes her way to San Diego. Her mom's
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.400]   there. They're living together for a while. They lose the house. She moves into her car. She's not
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.360]   doing great, but she has this prodigious talent. It's rough, but this prodigious talent in singing,
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.440]   living out of her car in San Diego. She comes across a coffee house, the interchange coffee
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.320]   house. That coffee house is sort of struggling. She talks to the owner, Nancy, and says, "Look,
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.400]   let me make you a deal. I'm going to perform here, just here, me and my guitar, and just give me a
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.360]   cut of the proceeds. I think that could help me out, and I think it could help your store actually
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.440]   grow." So Jewel forms what's essentially a residency at this small coffee house, and she
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.520]   just goes to promote her shows. She busks on the San Diego beachfront. When people come up to hear
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.760]   a player to put a dollar in her guitar case, she says, "Hey, come to my show." The first show,
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.480]   her memory is somewhere between two to four people showed up. Two to four surfers she met
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.880]   who thought she was cute on the beach, and they showed up. That was it. But she played her heart
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.120]   out because she had all this pain. I mean, I talk about this in Slow Productivity that Jewel is
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.440]   defined by these intertwined forces of talent and pain. She can sing, but there's a real heart to
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.880]   it. So she begins doing these epic performances that are like hours long. It's a lot of original
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.240]   songs, some covers. She's really burying her soul. They're emotional. People are crying.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.160]   So the word gets out, like, "What the hell? What's going on? There's something special.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.080]   It's rough, but there's something special going on here." She recalls there being basically
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.920]   exponential growth. There's two people, then four people, then eight people, then 16 people.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.400]   After a few months, people are spilling out onto the sidewalk outside of the interchange coffee
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.080]   house. They have to put up speakers outside just so you can hear the show if you can actually get
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.000]   in. Word gets out to the record executives, and they start showing up. They're like, "Okay,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.640]   there's something special here." They begin flying her to meetings, like, "Okay, we want to talk to
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.040]   you about signing with us because, look, clearly you have talent, and we don't want you to go to
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.160]   another record label." Finally, the record executive sits her down. This is where the story is where
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.920]   we're going to start to intersect with Slow Productivity here. Sits her down and says,
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.000]   "Okay, I'm putting this on the table right now, a million-dollar signing bonus." Remember,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.080]   this is the '90s, early '90s, a million dollars is a lot of money. Still is today, but even then,
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.680]   a lot of money. Jewel's living in her car, a million dollars on the table. She's like, "All
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.360]   right, let me go think about this." She's a fighter. She's incredibly self-reliant, right?
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.040]   She's like, "Hold on. Let me think about this." She goes to the library and gets out a book from
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.680]   the library about how to succeed. Not even how to succeed. I think it was just how the music
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.400]   industry works. With the help of the fact checker with my book, we tracked down the actual title of
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.440]   the book. She got it wrong in the interviews, but we found the real book she was talking about.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.320]   It's like a guidebook to the music industry. She looks into this and she says, "Okay,
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.760]   how do these signing bonuses work?" "Oh, they're in advance. They're in advance on the royalties
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.360]   you're going to make, so they give you a million dollars up front. The first million dollars you
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.640]   make goes to paying that back. Then after you pay it back, you get to keep any royalties beyond
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.320]   there. It's a standard advance set up. It's how books work as well, by the way. You get an advance
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.400]   on royalties and only after you pay back your advance do you actually earn any further royalties."
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.160]   She looks this up. She thinks about it. She goes back to the record executive
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.920]   and she says, "No, thank you." She turns down a million dollars. She's living in her car. She
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:17.040]   turns down a million dollars. So what's going on here? Well, Jewel, we really have to give her
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:25.680]   credit for this. She recognized that she had real talent, but also she was rough. Her only performance
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.840]   experience as a solo singer songwriter, not as playing Yodeling with her family or whatever,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.640]   but as a solo singer songwriter, her only experience was really playing in the Interchange
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.960]   Coffeehouse and a few other shows that she had done with friends. She knew if she'd accepted
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.680]   a million dollar signing bonus, the record label is going to say, "We have to go all in right away.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.360]   We need that money back. Let's throw you out there and see if you can become a superstar right away
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.680]   and make back the money. If you don't, I'm sorry, you're gone." That would have been her chance.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.560]   She thought, "I'm not ready for that yet. I need to learn how to get better at this,
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.720]   how to harness my craft." Her logic was absolutely right. If I don't cost the record label a lot of
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:16.400]   money, they won't care enough to kick me off the label if I'm not doing something right off the
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:23.200]   bat. They will let me stay as a signed musician performing and recording as long as I don't cost
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:29.360]   them a lot of money. I need that time. She had a phrase she had learned from her grandmother,
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:36.080]   "Hard wood grows slowly." She needed that time. She realized if she was going to be a real star,
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.120]   she needed time to get there. She said, "No million dollars."
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:48.400]   And then, oh, she's so clever. Such a shrewd sort of practicality in Jewel. She says, "But what we
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.600]   can do because I know they felt bad." She's turning down a million dollars. She said, "Well,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:01.120]   why don't we just make my back end higher? So if I do sell a lot of records, I'm going to make more
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.280]   money." And they're thinking, "Oh, look, she's probably not going to happen. This is great.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.240]   She's so cheap." So she gets a bigger back end than normal, which is going to pay her back
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:16.480]   handsomely in the future. Anyway, so now she's signed. Now she's signed, small advance, big back
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.520]   end, and she has to go record this album. And she was absolutely right. She wasn't ready to be a
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.040]   star. So she's thinking, and I love the details of this because it reminds me of what it's like and
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:33.360]   the complexities of ambition and actually living up to ambition. My whole life is defined by this
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.160]   at a much smaller scale, the ambition and the failures to fully reach that ambition and the
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.760]   glimpses of real success that are followed by the frustrations. So she wants to do something special
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.920]   and she turns down. They're giving her all these producers, the record labels, like, "Here's a
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.680]   hotshot pop producer. Here's another hotshot pop producer." She's like, "That's not what I want to
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.400]   do. Here's what I want to do. Neil Young's producer, whoever produced Harvest." Hey,
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:05.360]   quick interruption. If you want my free guide with my seven best ideas on how to cultivate
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:12.880]   the deep life, go to calnewport.com/ideas or click the link right below in the description.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.160]   This is a great way to take action on the type of things we talk about here on the show.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.280]   All right, let's get back to it. I love that sound. That's what I want to do.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.320]   They're like, "Okay. I mean, this is weird. It's like the '90s. It's like Lisa Loeb.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.560]   Pop punk is coming out of the grunge era at this point. You want to do a Neil Young? Okay."
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.920]   You know, they're like, "Okay, whatever. It's not costing us much money. Whatever you want to do."
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.600]   And she goes actually out to Neil Young's ranch, records her album with the Stray Gators,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.360]   with Neil Young's band in Northern California and his ranch with his producer,
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:53.120]   and they record her first album. It's not great because the problem is, and she was right,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.680]   she was nervous. All of her performance experience was her alone in a coffee shop,
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.400]   and now she's playing with the Stray Gators with Neil Young's backing band. She's nervous about
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   this, and it shows. It's tentative, right? I mean, it's like, "Okay. The songs are okay."
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   She had a good collection of songs from traveling and hitchhiking while she was at Interlochen,
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.360]   but it was nervous. They weren't great. The album comes out and not much happens. This thing is not
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.880]   selling. If she had done the million-dollar signing bonus, this is where they would have been
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.240]   like, "You're out of here." In fact, they wouldn't even let her have this experimentation. They would
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.800]   have made her done probably a real poppy type of album, like, "Let's get right after it." It
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.200]   wouldn't have worked, but she didn't cost them any money. It's like, "All right. We're not going to
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.920]   drop you. Why don't you go? I guess you can tour." She's like, "I'm going to tour really cheap. No
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:50.800]   van, no bus, a car, and I'll just drive along myself and tour really cheap." In fact, for a
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.720]   while, she was even performing with a group called Earth Jam that would perform, and I'm not kidding
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:03.520]   you here, environmentally-themed concerts for high schools during the day in exchange for them
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:10.640]   giving her transportation to her gigs at night. She was costing people nothing, performing,
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.440]   getting experience, starting a lot of college shows, a lot of live performances on college
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.880]   radio, playing at colleges. Really there, that vibe is where she began to pick up her confidence.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.760]   She did this for like a year of this going on, finally getting the training she needs to figure
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.280]   out, "How do I do this? How do I perform? How do I be more of a star and not just a coffee shop
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:38.960]   crooner?" Then she goes back and says, "Okay, let me re-record what I think could be a really big
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   song, 'You Were Meant For Me.' I was nervous. I was reporting this with the Stray Gators. I feel
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.160]   better now." She goes back and re-records it. She has her friend from California, Flea,
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.640]   the bassist from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, plays on that new re-recording.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.760]   Now, this one's working. It's more confidence, more sultry. Finally, things start to happen.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.360]   She begins with all her college touring to show up on the college charts. From there,
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   "Who Will Save Your Soul" starts to kind of make a move. It's kind of peaking up and people are
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.000]   listening to it here and there. Then she records this great video for her newly re-recorded version
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.280]   of "You Were Meant For Me," and that just explodes on MTV. She's ready for it now. We're like a year
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.760]   and a half out from her turning down a million dollars. She's ready for it now. That album,
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:29.680]   "Pieces of You," just explodes. Remember, she's getting extra backend, so the money is flying at
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:37.680]   her. Anyway, that's what happens with Jewel. What's the lesson here? Well, there's a principle
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:49.040]   in slow productivity that is titled "obsess over quality." Jewel's story gets to why this is
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:56.960]   important. See, when you obsess over quality, "I want to do something really well," escaping
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:05.520]   busyness and moving towards something more slow and sustainable becomes inevitable. It becomes
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.200]   natural. It becomes what's attractive to you. When you're not obsessed over doing something
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:15.120]   really well, there's an appeal to the busy and the frenetic because it's something to do.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.240]   You feel like, "I'm making moves. I'm jumping on calls. I have all these plans. I'm on Slack
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.520]   channels telling everyone things. I'm putting up videos of this over on TikTok." There is a
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.440]   warmth from the heat generated by the friction of freneticism,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.840]   but that warmth doesn't turn into real fires. It's not hot enough, but on the other hand,
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.680]   when you say, "No, no, I want to do something really well. I want to produce an album that's
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:46.480]   going to explode," I have to slow down because I need to get better. I need to get really good.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.400]   So I'm going to get a small record deal to have the record label leave me alone so I can just
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.880]   spend a year and a half touring and finding myself, finding my voice, getting advice,
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.720]   going back, re-recording, tinkering. She did a couple other versions of "You Were Meant for Me,"
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:07.520]   by the way, including a real poppy version with a top pop producer that was no good.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:13.280]   I've heard it. It's no good. She needed time and she had to slow down.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.840]   So when we try to parabolize this to our lives, not as singers, but as just knowledge workers
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.400]   doing whatever we do, accepting the million dollars is like the busyness, just like running
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.240]   around and doing everything. Turning down the million dollars and taking your time to figure
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.800]   out how to be a performer, that's slowing down. So that's the first lesson from Jewel's story.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.160]   Once you begin prioritizing doing something really well, the only thing that feels natural
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:51.520]   then is being less busy. The focus of quality is the antithesis of freneticism.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.560]   But there's a second lesson in here as well. So if we return to Jewel, what happens? Well,
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.640]   that album "Pieces of You" is just crazy. She makes a lot of money. How do we know she makes
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:09.360]   a lot of money? We know because for an unfortunate reason, there's this unfortunate side note to Jewel's
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:16.560]   story that her mom comes back into her life and basically takes over as her manager. We've heard
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:24.160]   this story before. This is the Colonel and Elvis. Look, there's nothing here that's that unusual.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.760]   Anyways, she steals a lot of Jewel's money. She steals a lot of her money. Eventually,
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.360]   there's a lawsuit. Jewel steals her mom. The only reason why that's relevant to us is in that
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:39.440]   lawsuit an amount is named. So we get a sense of how successful Jewel was with these initial albums.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.680]   The specific number she cited that her mom stole from her was $200 million.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:51.120]   So if it's possible for someone to steal $200 million for you, you're probably doing from a
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.560]   financial perspective. And again, I'm not an expert on this, but I would say pretty well.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.720]   Okay. So she's getting very successful. There's this whole mechanism now that surrounds her.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:06.240]   The better you get at doing something you love, the more the world conspires to try to prevent
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.600]   you from doing that thing. That's an axiom that all creatives know. This happens to Jewel.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:17.520]   So they send her on an international tour, exhausting, a Taylor Swift type thing. She
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:25.680]   comes back from the tour and now her agents are saying, "Okay, you're young and attractive. You
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:31.120]   need to do movies too. So move to Hollywood. Get her in the Devil's Backbone and Ang Lee movie.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.040]   Here's the plan. Move to LA. We're going to do international tour movies. International
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:42.240]   tour movies. You're going to be a multimedia mogul star." And Jewel says, "Well, wait a second. What
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.320]   do I want to do? I want to produce great music. I don't worry about money. I have plenty of money.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.080]   I want to produce great music." "No, thank you." Never does an international tour again,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.400]   leaves the movie business, does not settle in LA, goes to a ranch in Texas with her boyfriend,
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:05.040]   who was a rodeo rider, and just writes music. So there's another lesson in there. And again,
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.000]   I'm trying to parabolize this and the lessons are going to be relevant to us who are not
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.360]   really fancy and successful movie stars. The lesson here is that by getting really good at
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.840]   something, Jewel was able to gain autonomy over what her work was like. So getting good at
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.400]   something enables slowness. So as you quest to get good, lesson number one, you crave slowness.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.760]   As you get better at things, lesson number two, you gain the autonomy to actually enforce more
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.080]   slowness in your life. Jewel is a very successful musician, so she could basically say, "No,
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.520]   I don't want to do this other stuff. I just want to write music. I have enough money. I have enough
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.200]   F.U. money to say, 'No, I'm going to shape what my life is like,' and I want it to be slow."
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:57.520]   So we've got these great two lessons in here. Quality makes slowness something that is necessary
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.680]   and appealing. The pursuit of quality also eventually makes slowness something that you
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:07.440]   can more easily enforce or maintain in your life. So we have a virtuous flywheel here. It's why I
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.000]   call this last principle, obsess over quality, the glue that holds all the other principles of
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.560]   slow productivity together, because it makes the other ideas possible. The other ideas are about
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.240]   doing fewer things and working at a more natural pace. The obsession over quality
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:28.720]   really makes that much more possible. All right, so let's try to apply this to a normal knowledge
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:35.200]   work job. What is the template we want to apply if you're a marketing director or a programmer and
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:42.640]   not a music superstar? Well, think about it this way. One, figure out what you do best
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:50.400]   or what you could do that's going to be the most valuable for your sector or organization.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:56.240]   We often skip over this step, but it's really hard sometimes to figure out what really matters.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:02.080]   What is our equivalent of Jewel's performance singing ability? It's not always obvious in
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:08.720]   non-specifically creative careers, so we have to go find it. And then once we find up, we have to
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.880]   create our equivalent of Jewel's training regime. She spent a year and a half on the road figuring
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:19.840]   out, "How do I perform? How do I find my voice? What is my voice? How do I translate what I was
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.440]   doing in the interchange coffeehouse into something that translates to a CD that's
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.560]   going to MTV? I'm going to work on that craft." Well, you have to have a similar training regime
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.880]   where you haven't just identified, "Here's what matters in my job," but you know how you're
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.120]   getting after that, how you're improving that. And then three, as you get more successful,
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.880]   cash that in to gain more autonomy over your work so that you can have whatever level or definition
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.480]   of slowness appeals to you. So you can step away from busyness and keep your work crafted
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:55.680]   around the things that really resonate. That's hard as well. That's hard as well because,
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.000]   well, as you get better, people aren't going to be offering you to do less.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.600]   So you're going to have to actually make that call yourself. So let's look at some concrete
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.480]   examples here. Let's go back to I mentioned marketing director. What might this dual
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.600]   strategy look like, obsessing over quality, look like if you're a marketing director?
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:19.920]   Well, maybe what you realize is, okay, when you get measurement-based,
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:25.360]   you can really get fine-tuned about figuring out what marketing efforts work and what don't,
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.600]   how to lean in heavily on the things that work and away from the things that don't.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.360]   And so maybe you decide, "I'm going to become ruthlessly measurement-based in designing of
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.760]   my marketing strategies, even if this is kind of scary because I'm not just doing here's a standard
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.520]   mix of things. You can't really get mad at me. I'm doing sort of the right things." Like, "No,
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.600]   I'm ruthlessly measurement-based. I'm learning these measurement tools.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.640]   I'm trusting the data. I'm pushing the things that are working well beyond what is normal."
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:58.640]   And maybe as a result, by doing this, your campaigns are unusual and innovative and very
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.400]   successful. So you figured out what's important. My campaign's working and a training regime for
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.280]   getting there. I'm going to do this sort of leaning into evidence-based in this example.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.000]   Now you have to use that success to gain autonomy. So now imagine you say, "Okay,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.480]   I'm really desirable in this sector. I'm leaving my company to go freelance. You can hire me to
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.680]   run the marketing for your particular whatever it is, product or launch or whatever.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.440]   And I'm going to charge a good amount of money because I'm really good at this.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.160]   I can back it up and I'm going to do this eight months a year. Four months a year,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.520]   I don't take contracts. That's just the deal. So if your contract overlaps those four months,
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:42.720]   I just can't do it." Imagine that now. Now you've created this really nice sort of slow rhythm where
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.680]   you're doing great work. You have four months a year, you're not working at all. I mean,
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.640]   you could just imagine in this daydream here how you've escaped just being like a lower-level
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.320]   marketing director that they don't really trust. They're bothering you with emails and you're
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.200]   working all the time and you're always worried about your job. All right, what about if you're
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.080]   a programmer? Let's give another concrete example here. Maybe you really look around and say, "Oh,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:09.840]   this particular specialty is incredibly valuable right now." Maybe it's like API development for
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:15.920]   platforms, or maybe it's something in the AI space, like you're very comfortable
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:23.840]   working with the ML libraries for Google. I'm very comfortable working with
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:30.880]   doing efficient training code for neural nets or something like that. You figure out like,
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.800]   "This is the thing that's really valuable. We don't have a good person for this. These people
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.320]   are really desirable." And you just work an hour a day. You train yourself. You read and do sample
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.800]   projects. You're just doing this, forcing yourself to get better and better and better at this.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.440]   And as you get better and better, you eventually be considered a 10X programmer.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.080]   Your salary jumps up. Maybe you begin to dictate more the terms of how your work happens. I do one
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.320]   project at a time. I take sabbaticals every three years. They're just happy to have you because they
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   don't want the other team to have you. Completely different, less busy life. You can dictate the
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.480]   terms. Those are just some concrete examples of what I'm trying to show you here is that
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:17.440]   this dual strategy of figuring out what matters, systematically pursuing it, leveraging success to
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.160]   gain autonomy and to move away from busyness and towards something more meaningful really can apply
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.840]   to many different jobs. All right. So what are the pitfalls here that you want to avoid? I have
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:31.760]   three real quick I want to mention. This first one actually came up in my conversation with Ryan
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.640]   Holiday when I did his podcast recently to talk about slow productivity because it was actually
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.440]   an idea of his that we sort of riffed on. And this was this idea of you want to make sure that
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.440]   you're not playing the wrong game. So one of the biggest pitfalls is like, look, I want to do really
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.800]   well, but you're doing well at the wrong game. And the example he gave, which I think is a good one,
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.400]   is focusing on pleasing over impressing. And he said, OK, here's what I want to do
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:04.160]   is I'm going to be super responsive. Like I make everyone else's life easier. You need something,
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.840]   I'll do it. Even if I have to stay up late, I'll answer your emails right away.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.240]   Like my job is to reduce stress in everybody else's life. And people will love you for that.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.400]   But they won't respect you for that. You're not going to gain yourself autonomy or leverage doing
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.720]   that. You're going to you're going to gain yourself a lot more work. Now, consider the
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.440]   other game to play, which is I want to impress all these people. It's not impressive to be super
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.400]   responsive and to do what it takes to get these small things done. It's not impressive. It's
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:39.440]   useful to them. Impressive is I can program these transformer matrix manipulations for this AI thing
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.080]   better than anyone else, you know, and it gives us a 10x speed up in the training when I do it,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:49.760]   when I'm on the team and I'm like fine with email. I'm kind of you know, I'm not like a jerk about
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.280]   it, but I'm I'm not like great at the small things you give me, but I can do this really
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.760]   well. And that's really impressive. That is much more valuable. Playing the game of being
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.880]   impressive instead of playing the game of pleasing people. Pitfall number two has to do with the
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:12.960]   training aspect. Right? So these pitfalls, by the way, correspond to the three part lessons of the
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.720]   first part was figure out what you do best. Playing the wrong game is a pitfall about getting that
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.200]   wrong. The second part of our three step system was create a training regime. So the pitfall here
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.160]   is what I call going on fun runs instead of interval training. Right? So like when people
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:32.320]   want to become a better runner, they're amateur runners, they want to just like go for 5k runs
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.720]   and blast music and kind of like go fast at the end and work up a sweat, but never really do
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.120]   anything that hard. Right? Whereas like serious runners like no, no, no, I'm either doing 10 mile
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.000]   runs to build up my aerobic base, or I'm doing vomit inducing intervals to get my speed up.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.760]   It's not fun. Right? The professional runners are doing the stuff you really need to do to get
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.600]   better. The amateur runners are doing the stuff that they they want to do. So they kind of tell
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.920]   the story that that's what's important. Same thing happens with knowledge or professional skills all
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:05.200]   the time. We write a story about what we want to do, because we like the idea of like, I spent 30
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.640]   minutes doing this you to me course on programming every day, I can find time for it. It's not too
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.280]   hard, but it makes me feel productive. We write stories about what we want to be important.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.320]   Instead of figuring out the things that actually matter. And almost always the things that
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.600]   actually matter aren't fun, you have to learn to actually get the pleasure out of doing the
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:29.520]   hard thing other people won't do. Athletes know this. You have to you have to alchemize
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:35.120]   intense discomfort of certain training, I can't understand this math, but I'm going to crack it.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.360]   alchemize that into fulfillment. Yeah, other people are going to give up. I'm not.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:46.000]   I'm not going to give up here. All right, the third pitfall here. So when it comes to using
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.240]   success to gain more autonomy, the pitfall here is what I call the control trap. This was in my
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:57.360]   book so good, they can't ignore you. The control trap. The control trap basically says, as you get
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.600]   good enough to gain control over your career, and the potentially use this to gain more autonomy
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.680]   to gain more slowness, that is exactly the time where you're going to be presented with all of
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:12.720]   these really flattering opportunities to get paid more and get more whatever respect, I guess,
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.040]   like more clout in your field, in exchange for having a busier, more frenetic job.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.280]   Like as soon as you get good enough to be able to demand slowness,
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.040]   people will start offering you fastness on the most appealing platters you've seen.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.880]   Hey, good news. You could be a managing partner at our law firm. Like, oh, man, that's hard.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.280]   And that, you know, that pays a lot of money. Yeah, that's definitely what I want to do.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:41.520]   By the way, it's twice to work, you know, so as you get really good at something,
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.560]   people don't come to you and say, hey, you're really good. You want to like chill?
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.640]   Like we'll pay you the same amount of money and you can work half the time if you want.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.080]   They don't say that. They say, how about we double the money and double the amount of work you do?
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.120]   That's the control trap. So you're going to have to fight against the grain.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:03.680]   No one is going to hold your hand, applying your hard won leverage in the market to try
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:08.480]   to make your life slower. No one wants you to be slower. You have to be the one to demand
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.680]   it and have faith in yourself. All right. So this is a pitfalls. All right. So anyways, there we go.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:18.000]   That's the story of Jewel. I think it's a really cool story. I tell it in detail and slow productivity,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.920]   but those are the lessons to pull from it. Obsessing over quality makes slowness seem
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.680]   absolutely necessary. Obsessing over quality eventually gives you more options than you
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.200]   thought you ever had to actually put slowness into pursuit. So quality and slowness are
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:39.760]   intertwined. If you want to escape overload and crushing busyness, paradoxically, focusing on
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.840]   what matters and sometimes working harder on what matters is going to make your life easier.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:50.400]   All right. So we have some great questions to get to. First, however, I want to talk about one of
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:57.840]   the sponsors that makes this show possible. That is our good friends at Shopify, the global
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:03.760]   commerce platform that helps you sell at every stage of your business from the launcher online
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.560]   shop stage to the first real life store stage, all the way to the, did we just hit a million dollars
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:16.880]   in order stage? Shopify is there to help you grow. You have an all-in-one e-commerce platform.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:22.160]   You have an in-person point of sale system, whatever you're selling, they've got you covered.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:29.200]   Look, if you're doing e-commerce, Shopify has one of the best converting checkout packages on the
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.600]   internet, 36% better on average and converting people in the buyers compared to other leading
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:41.280]   e-commerce platforms. Jess and I always talk about, we should start a store at some point,
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:46.320]   a deep question store. And then we have terrible idea for merchandise by which I mean, brilliant
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:52.880]   ideas for merchandise. My best idea, of course, being the shirt that has the VBLCPP, VBLCPP,
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:31:00.160]   VBLCBP slogan right across the front, values-based lifestyle center, career planning,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.280]   and just assumes people know what that means because you can wear that shirt and be like,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.720]   and then offer high fives to people. And then they're confused and they kind of walk by and
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.000]   that's the type of fun you could have. Anyways, when we open our store to sell that shirt,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.360]   we would of course use Shopify. Basically everyone I know in this game who sells their own things,
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:26.480]   they use Shopify because it makes it easier and it works well. So you can sign up now for a $1
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:34.000]   per month trial period at shopify.com/deep, but just put that into your browser, all lowercase,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.320]   go to shopify.com/deep, all lowercase to grow your business no matter what stage you're in,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:49.120]   shopify.com/deep. I also want to talk about our good friends at Element. Look,
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.080]   healthy hydration isn't just about drinking water. It's about water and electrolytes.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.280]   It makes sense. You lose both water and sodium when you sweat. Both need to be replaced to
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.920]   prevent muscle cramps, headaches, and energy dips. But most people only replace the water
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:09.360]   because we keep being told, "Hey, just drink a lot of water." But drinking water beyond just
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.600]   your thirst is a bad idea. It could dilute blood electrolyte levels, especially sodium levels,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.840]   which leads to headaches, low energy, cramps, confusion, or more. The solution is not to stop
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:23.360]   drinking water. It's to add more electrolytes to your water. This is where Element, L-M-N-T,
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:30.160]   enters the scene. Created by former research biochemist, Rob Wolfe, and KetoGains founder,
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.880]   Louis Valseigneur, Element has enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium to keep you feeling and
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:41.840]   performing your best, plus zero sugar, zero artificial colors, and no dodgy ingredients
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:48.640]   in it. You've got a lot of great flavors you can love, including citrus salt or raspberry salt. I
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:54.480]   like citrus salt. They also have spicy flavors like mango chili or chocolate salt, which you
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:00.240]   can mix into your morning coffee for a mean mocha. I was actually just out, as I mentioned, at Andrew
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:08.320]   Huberman's studio. And I can tell you, Huberman and I mixed up some Element to stay hydrated for,
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.720]   I believe our episode was, and I'm checking this here in the notes, 17 hours long.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.520]   Look, I get dehydrated not just from exercise, but from talking all the time.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:23.200]   Element is absolutely what I drink to get those electrolytes up without having to have sugar and
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.000]   all the other weird stuff. So anyways, Element has a fantastic offer just for us. Go to
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.720]   drinkelement.com/deep to get a free sample pack with any purchase. That's drinkelement, L-M-N-T.com/deep.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:42.480]   All right, let's get back to our show and do some questions.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:50.080]   Our first question comes from Claire. Look, I always, for those who are watching on the video,
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.640]   by the way, you see, I keep checking over here. There's no Jesse. So it's up to me to make sure
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.240]   that we're actually still recording. I believe we still are. All right. Our first question comes
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:05.840]   from Claire. Claire says the following, "I am judged based on productive output, where I have
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:11.360]   to complete seven or eight reports per day that take an hour each. So instead of being able to do
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:17.280]   a few hours of deep work and take a break, I am working eight hours and a half deep work state.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.360]   I need to focus, but not that intensely. I have a number of side projects I want to work on in
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:27.120]   my off time, but I'm tired. Should I try to find a job that's not too hard?" Well, Claire, maybe,
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.600]   but let's talk first about what you could do with this current job. And then maybe that will help
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.440]   you think through a little bit more critically about whether it's worth trying to change this
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:45.440]   job or not. First, I want to just point out seven or eight hours of semi-deep work on reports is
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.160]   actually still a lot better than what a lot of people have, which is zero deep work hours,
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:55.440]   plus about 10 hours of partial continuous attention, non-deep context switching,
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.800]   overload nonsense. A day full of meetings and email and Slack, which is all administrative
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.600]   overhead generated by the too many tasks that they've agreed to and are on their task list,
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.360]   leading them to a nihilistic sense of absurdity that all I ever do is talk about work and almost
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.720]   never, nothing actually gets done. Few exhaustions are more deranging than that of having to switch
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.880]   your attention every few minutes and yet never feeling like you're making progress. All this to
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:25.440]   say, "Hey, this kind of sounds nice that you could work on one thing at a time and aren't have to be
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.840]   on email and chat." So look, there's some silver lining here, but here would be my first suggestion.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.160]   Why can't we change this to five to six reports per day?
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:38.240]   Wouldn't that make your life a lot easier? Now, look, I don't know the setup of your job. Maybe
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.480]   that would mean having to take less money. That might be worth it, by the way, but I wouldn't
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:47.360]   offer that right away, less money. Just do the reports better and just say, "Look, this seven
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.080]   to eight is too many. My quality is flagging. I want to do five or six. Hey, but check my quality.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.960]   These are going to be great. They're going to be better. And I think this is better." And just do
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.920]   it. And they might end up being like, "Okay, fine. These are better." Maybe you didn't need to be
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.560]   doing seven to eight. You just set that arbitrary standard. Now, maybe they say, "No, no, no. Even
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:10.480]   if they're better, we're going to pay you less." That still might be worth it. That still might be
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:17.120]   worth it because even if they're paying you less, five to six reports a day means five hours of work
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:23.520]   maybe, and you could be done. I like the sound of that. All right. So let's think about this some
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:29.680]   more. Instead of doing one hour per report at a half state of deep work, I want you to consider
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:35.840]   doing 30 to 40 minutes of really intense deep work supported by rituals and a structured process for
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:41.600]   how you go through these reports. So it's not just haphazard thinking that gives you 30 to 20 minutes
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.000]   of rest in between each report, or allows you to do two reports, take an hour off, two reports,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.920]   and an hour off. I want to find a way that you're not going constantly, but you have more of a
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.480]   rhythm of intensity and non-intensity. Now, if you're working 30 to 40 minutes and then taking
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:00.800]   a break, you're going to want to make those breaks. You have to be careful with those breaks.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.360]   You have to take what I call deep breaks, which means you need to be careful not to have this
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:11.600]   break be a hard context shift. You don't want to look at email or unrelated, highly emotionally
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   salient information. You're going to want these other breaks to focus on things that don't really
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.120]   change your context too much so that you can 20 minutes later, get back into the next report
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:28.960]   without having to start from scratch. So try those two things. And I think this could be better.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:36.080]   Okay. Those who are watching the video see I keep looking around because I have a mysterious buzzing
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:41.040]   happening in my ear here. Hold on a second. I'm doing some live debugging. I don't think
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:48.800]   this is showing up on the recording. It's driving me crazy. Hold on one second.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:38:00.640]   All right. Well, that's exciting. Podcasting right there is what you get for solo podcasting.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:06.400]   By the way, we're pretty svelte with one producer here. Some shows are like that. A lot of other
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.800]   shows I've noticed where really they have a lot of pretty large teams. So I think we're pretty
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:16.240]   svelte here. All right. Our next question comes from Evan. Evan says, I'm in the early stages of
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:22.000]   my career and realized that a disproportionate amount of success in the corporate world depends
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.160]   on your ability to sell yourself. I've seen competent, quiet managers get fired while
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:34.400]   talking heads get steadily promoted. How do I sell my skills better? And if needed interview better.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:41.680]   Well, Evan, this is a key place where I want to bring up one of the pitfalls that we discussed
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.640]   when talking about the story of Jewel in the deep dive, which was the fun run versus interval
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:54.880]   training pitfall, which says the key here is to not to write your own story about what matters,
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:00.640]   but to learn what actually does matter. All right. So it's very tempting in this type of situation
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.680]   to come up with what you want to be important. This is what I want to work on. And if I do
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.840]   this, then I'm going to get more notice. I'm going to be more successful because I like the sound of
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:17.440]   it. I like the sound of it. It's tractable. It's not too hard, but it sounds good. No,
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.680]   you need to go figure out for the people who are good at what you see as being needed for success
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.760]   to people who are good, who are getting steadily promoted. What specifically are they doing that
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.640]   matters? This might mean actually talking to them. I want to learn from you. How did you get this
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.400]   promotion? What about this one? What was key? What were you doing that other people who are up for
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:40.560]   that promotion didn't do? Learn what really matters. You might discover, for example,
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.840]   that actually it's not about them selling themselves. Like maybe it turns out, and I've
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.280]   been down this road before in my own life, where I thought it was a marketing thing mattered.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.000]   And it turned out like, no, actually the thing they were doing was just better than what I'm
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.560]   doing. So it might turn out, oh, this is the skill that really matters. It's very hard. I'm doing
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.000]   that. Okay. They're doing it better. This is not about them selling themselves, or maybe it is
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   about selling themselves, but you learn out what that means. What aspect of selling themselves
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.800]   is it that in the end really matters? So you've got to get to the bottom of what matters. Don't
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   write your own story. And then you can decide, do I want to do that or not? And if so, what's
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.400]   my training regime? And let's get after it systematically head down relentlessly. And if
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.560]   not, at least, you know, why not? Oh, this is harder or requires sacrifices that I'm not right
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:28.400]   now willing to make. And by the way, that second answer is fine as well. So there's a technological
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.760]   piece to this because a lot of people have this sense about social media promotion.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:37.120]   I think what matters is that professor, that manager, that writer, it's what they're doing
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:42.080]   on social media that matters. So maybe I need to do more of that. If I just did more of that,
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.040]   I'd be more successful, right? It's a common story that we tell ourselves when we're looking
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.960]   at self-promotion and success. But when you dig deep in a lot of these cases, it turns out
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.880]   it's not the key. The key is what they're doing is good. They're doing something different. They
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:01.120]   got lucky, you know? So anyways, reality is more complicated. You got to actually confront the
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:08.560]   reality. Let's move on here. We got Mike. Mike says, I'm an animator and I have good productivity
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:14.320]   and focus in the office. However, I struggle to work on my personal projects at home. I only do
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:19.120]   tasks that have the least resistance, such as organizing files instead of doing the actual work.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:26.560]   How can I do the hard tasks for my personal projects? Well, Mike, first of all,
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:32.720]   the stuff you're mentioning as least resistant, such as organizing files, maybe this is not so
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.440]   unimportant. A lot of what's important in household labor is actually pretty organizational.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:44.880]   It's keeping the household as basically a pseudo business running well, which is often less about
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:50.480]   big leaps of deep work or Bravo performance and more about actually keeping a lot of balls very
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:57.520]   carefully moving in the air so none of them fall. Also, you might consider just doing fewer projects
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.720]   and making the projects you do better. So when it comes to personal projects,
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:07.040]   there's a couple of reasons why you might not be coming back to them. There's a couple of reasons
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.240]   why you might be looking to lesser resistant alternatives. One could be you don't really
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.360]   love the project. It was just like, I want to do this. I want to learn Spanish. And you don't
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.160]   really love the idea. You're not that excited about it. And you're tired because you have a
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.400]   hard job and you're trying to take care of your house and maybe your family and that limited
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.680]   time and energy. If it's a project you don't love, your mind might say no moss.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:31.760]   See what I did there? That was Spanish. Here's the other problem. Maybe you do love the project,
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:37.440]   but your plan stinks. Like I want to be a novelist. And so like, why don't,
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.960]   why am I just not going down to my writing room and writing? Because your mind says that's just
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.880]   not, that's not enough. You go into that room and writing is not going to produce a novel.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.840]   That's going to sell. We need to learn more about this. We've got to get better at writing. We need
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.880]   an editor. You know, this is not a good plan. Your brain knows it's not a good plan. And so when
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.240]   you're saying maybe I should go spend some hours writing at the library, whatever your brain says,
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.720]   let's organize the files. Come on, let's get real. It's a good future plan evaluator.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.760]   All right. So maybe you need fewer projects and the projects you choose need to be better,
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:13.120]   but also just ease up. You know, I came across like several in recent weeks meeting impressive
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:19.360]   people while working on book promotion who had the same thing. They told me the same thing.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.960]   They don't really have a lot of hobbies right now. They're trying to do something professionally.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.600]   It's really important. They have families. They're trying to keep their health up because they're
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.440]   reaching middle age and it matters. A lot of people, my age and my situation, for example,
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.120]   just don't have a lot of personal projects. That's fine too. You don't have to have a lot
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:39.360]   of personal projects. Having a good job, staying, like keeping your body running,
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.640]   being a leader for your family, like that's a lot, that's a hard job. So if you're not feeling it
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.120]   right now in your current stage of life, you're not out there doing the complicated hobbies or
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.280]   whatever, you can ease up on yourself a little bit. I think that's okay. We don't always have
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:59.920]   to be doing that, especially if our setup is not one that makes that easy to do. If we don't have
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.680]   a highly autonomous setup with a lot of time or it's an activity that we've done for a long time
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:10.240]   and really love. All right, we've got a question here from Elena. Elena says, "My day consists of
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:15.680]   waking up at 5 a.m., getting ready for the gym, reading for 15 to 20 minutes, returning from the
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:21.360]   gym by 7.30, finishing showering, having breakfast by almost 9. Currently, I can't say that I have
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.440]   rare and valuable skills to offer and I have a job from 9 to 6 that doesn't offer that many
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:30.240]   opportunities to develop those skills either, although it pays very well. In this scenario,
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.440]   how can I do less at a natural pace but at least include a chunk of deliberate practice into my day
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.120]   to learn rare and valuable skills that allow me to build a remarkable life without falling into
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:45.840]   busyness?" Oh, Elena, you got a lot going on. I mean, look, I'm very impressed by your drive here,
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:55.600]   but let's slow down a little bit because I worry that you're approaching the problem
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:01.440]   of wanting a slower work life by pushing more fast activity into it.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.880]   And that might not be the right way to solve this. Let me be specific here. This is hypothetical. I
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.600]   don't know the exact details of your situation, but let me give you a sense about this.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:17.120]   What if we instead said we're going to make these changes? Your goal is to end your day at 4.30,
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:23.760]   instead of 6, you're going to go to the gym at 4.30 instead. Hold on to the complaint for now.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.840]   I'll never get my work done if I finish at 6. People will notice that's too early. Hold that
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:34.400]   aside for now. It's going to be our goal to finish work by 4.30, go to the gym then.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.680]   Now, this means you don't have to wake up at 5. Now, you can actually sleep, get more sleep,
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:45.360]   sleep to a more reasonable hour. Using that extra time, even sleeping later,
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.080]   you're going to be able to start your workday earlier. Because we've gotten rid of this time
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.240]   in the gym and the morning reading. So you can start your work earlier and do it in a very
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:46:01.760]   demonstrable way. The key idea from slow productivity is that we use a lot of pseudo
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:06.960]   productivity right now. This idea of using visible activity as a proxy for useful effort. So lean
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.720]   into that a little bit, take advantage of that, be visibly starting your workday a little bit earlier,
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.560]   but spend the first hour of that workday doing deliberate practice on a skill that you want to
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.840]   get really good at. So going back to the JUUL example, you've isolated a rare and valuable
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.440]   skill you do want to develop. You have the first hour of every day you're doing deliberate practice.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.160]   Your bosses don't necessarily know that's what you're doing. They just know that like, "Hey,
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.880]   Elena's here. It's 8 or it's 8.30 and she's getting after it." And they don't know what
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:36.160]   you're really doing is training more than answering emails or doing something else.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:42.480]   Now, because you're starting work earlier, it's not as big of a deal that you're ending earlier.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.720]   Now you also still have to get better at your work itself. Like if you're working from nine to six,
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:51.040]   like probably I'm going to guess this is a pretty haphazard day. So you know the stuff
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:57.840]   we talk about on here. You need a multi-scale planning. You probably need to reduce, this is
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.600]   a key idea from slow productivity, reduce the number of things you're actively working on at
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.160]   once. It's like, here's the three things I'm working on right now actively. These five things
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:11.200]   I'm waiting to work on as I finish one of these, I'll pull one of those in. This reduces the
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.720]   administrative overhead you're facing at any one moment, which allows you to actually move faster
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.680]   with completion. There's a whole chapter in slow productivity that gives you specific step-by-step
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.680]   tactics for how to do this in your job in a way that people will tolerate and will really work
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.640]   really well. You do these things so that you're able to get more work done, the right work done
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:34.720]   more effectively. And you'll be producing more by 4.30 than you were by six. And your bosses
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.920]   think you're starting work early anyways. And you know, they're like, "Oh, Elena's really into
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.440]   exercise and she comes in early. She leaves a little early. She does really good work. This
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.920]   is great." But you've transformed your life in this plan. Now you're not waking up at five,
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.480]   you're getting an hour of deliberate practice in, you're ending your workday with an exercise,
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:56.640]   which I do. I think it's a great way to transition from work mode into after work mode.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.000]   By six now, when you used to finish work, you're done with your exercise and you're done with your
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.400]   work. You got some sleep, you did your deliberate practice, and you can read at night. That could
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.480]   be like a really good activity is that you read instead of watching TV show. You have a lot of,
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.720]   you have this evening free now. You don't have to go to bed at nine because you're waking up so early.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:20.000]   So, you know, I don't know if for your particular situation, that particular reconfiguration works,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.160]   but it's a good sample reconfiguration because it highlights the possibilities here.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:29.360]   It highlights the possibilities that you have when you think about slowness, that
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:34.240]   structuring your time, being more careful about when you do things. You can produce a lot and be
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.360]   very successful. You have more options than you think about how you produce a lot, how you're
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.680]   successful. You can take the reins a little bit more to make your life more sustainable.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.800]   All right, let's do one last question here. This one's from Cameron. Cameron says,
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.280]   I have a hard job and I'm trying to use the deep life stack 2.0 to balance everything.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.760]   For my discipline stack, I take daily walks, go to the gym and read. How is this different
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:02.720]   than the value stack where I create rituals and routines for hard work? Well, Cameron,
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:09.840]   I wanted to end with a little bit of deep life pontificating, I guess I would say. The bigger
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:14.000]   picture here of living a deep life, which encompasses a lot more than just work.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.080]   We talked a lot in today's episode specifically about knowledge work and using quality to slow
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:24.080]   down and getting away from busyness and strategies to get there. But I like to bring it back in the
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.240]   end to the broader goal here, which is work is one part of an overall deep life. And that's really
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.800]   our goal in the show is in this world that's increasingly defined by technological forces,
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:37.600]   by email, by social media, by artificial intelligence, all these forces that are
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:41.280]   shaping our lives and reshaping our lives and destabilizing things that we know and making
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.840]   things harder or weirder or newer. How do we build a life that's deep and rooted, that's really human,
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.080]   that we like, that's meaningful, that's sustainable. And this has a lot more to do than just
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.520]   work. So I want to end on that question. Now, Cameron, I think the issue here is you're mixing
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:00.080]   things up. So when we talk about values in the context of the deep life, when we talk about
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:04.400]   rituals and routines for values, these are not rituals and routines for hard work, as you write
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.040]   here. They're rituals and routines for reinforcing your values and your values have nothing to do
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:15.040]   with work. Your values are the underlying things that you think are critical to a life well lived.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.440]   These are the things that if there was an apocalypse and you were starting over
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:25.360]   and you're escaping from the vampire cannibals, the things that you would rebuild from,
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:31.680]   the respect for other individuals, the being of infinite worth, leadership and character,
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:37.600]   integrity, that are trying to be someone who produces things of impact, showing up when people
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:42.880]   need to be there. I mean, these are values. Routines and rituals are about reinforcing
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:48.240]   these, these most fundamental atoms of what actually comprises the human life well lived.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.400]   Nothing to do with hard work. So what are routines and rituals that reinforce these values? I mean,
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:59.040]   rituals are things that you do on a regular basis that helps reconnect you to these things you care
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:05.760]   about. And it could be the gratitude walk you do through the woods to reconnect to the wonders of
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:14.640]   the world. It could be a ritual built instead around prayer that connects you to the divine
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:21.840]   as a source of strength to go through the hardships of life. Routines here could be things you just do
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:28.880]   on the regular to help make sure that you're connected to your values. Things that actually
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.840]   have practical values. Rituals have no practical values other than just to reinforce a value.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:38.640]   Routines are things you do to put those values regularly into your life. I volunteer two days
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:43.600]   a week because that pragmatically puts one of these things I value into my life on a regular basis.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:50.560]   For example, I read five books a month because the life of the mind as like this Aristotelian
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:55.840]   theological goal of the human existence is important to me, but this routine of reading
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:00.160]   every day. So I read five books so I can get to five books a month because that puts my value
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.120]   into action. So rituals is just about reinforcing psychologically the importance of a value to you.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:09.440]   Routines are about pragmatically putting values into actions on a regular basis into your life.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:15.680]   And this is not about hard work. It's not about going to the gym. It's really about the things
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.000]   that make humans, humans. And why this is so important in the context of a deep life is that
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.840]   work comes and goes and it goes well and it goes bad. And sometimes it's in your control and
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.160]   sometimes that's not. And sometimes you get sick and you can't work the way you used to work before
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:31.120]   or you thought you're going to be really good at this. And people come along and say, no, you're
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.720]   not, or you have the big plan and it fails and you lose all the money and you have to start over.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:39.280]   And it's kind of humiliating. So it can't just be work that you're trying to build this whole
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:43.520]   edifice on. It's got to be something deeper, more fundamental, more human. And that is,
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.560]   that's what I mean by values. But Cameron, I appreciate the question
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:53.920]   because it allowed us to talk deeper about the deep life. All right. So speaking about the deep
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.600]   life, I mentioned reading as part of it, which means I want to talk about the books I read in
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.400]   February. First, I want to briefly mention another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:09.360]   That's our friends at My Body Tutor. I've known Adam Gilbert, My Body Tutor's founders for many
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:15.440]   years. He's my go-to guy for fitness advice. His company, My Body Tutor is a fantastically
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:23.440]   smart idea because it is a 100% online coaching program. So you can get a coach like the Hollywood
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:27.680]   stars have when they prepare for a role in a movie. But instead of having to have someone
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.360]   come to your house at great expense, you can interact with them online. So you get that
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:37.680]   consistency and tailored help, the accountability that comes with it without the expense of having
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:43.520]   to have someone in your home gym telling you to use the combat ropes. So the way it works is you
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:48.640]   get assigned this coach. You tell them what you care about with your health journey. They help
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.160]   you figure out like, what are we gonna do with your diet? And let's come up with a plan here
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:55.200]   that makes sense for you and your circumstances. What are we gonna do with your exercises that
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:59.280]   makes sense for you and your circumstances? And then every day you check in with that coach using
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.000]   the easy online app and they see and they respond every day. And if you have questions like, hey,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.160]   this isn't working for me, like let's tailor that so it does. You have a one-off situation. The
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.560]   holidays are coming up. What do I do about this? They give you one-off specific advice for your
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.040]   particular situation. And you build a relationship with your coach. It's not just tailored advice,
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:20.800]   but it's the accountability of knowing they're looking at what you did and didn't do. It's
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.040]   miraculous how well it works. If you really wanna get healthier, this is the way to do it.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:33.120]   You go to MyBodyTutor, T-U-T-O-R. Go to MyBodyTutor.com. And when you do mention deep
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:37.200]   questions when you sign up and Adam will give you $50 off your first month, just mention that
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:43.920]   podcast when you sign up and it'll give you $50 off. MyBodyTutor, it is the way to get healthier.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:51.360]   I also wanna talk about our longtime friends at Blinkist. Blinkist is an app that gives you
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.360]   more than 6,500 book summaries and expert-led audio guides to read and listen to in just
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:03.440]   15 minutes per title. You can access best-in-class actionable knowledge from 27 categories such as
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.640]   productivity, psychology, and more, and also get entertained at the same time.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:16.080]   The way Jesse and I use Blinkist is as a triage tool for the books we read. If there's a book
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:21.440]   that we think might be important, we will put it on a list. And to help make the decision about
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:26.160]   whether or not we buy that book, we will read the Blink, which is what they call the 15-minute
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:31.600]   summary of the book. I'll sometimes listen to them. Jesse likes to read them. This gives you
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.920]   a really good sense about the book. Sometimes once you get that 15-minute summary, you're like,
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:41.120]   "Okay, this isn't quite for me. I get the gist of it. I don't wanna spend a week with this book."
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:44.640]   But I got the main ideas. That's useful. And sometimes the Blink, it's like, "Oh, that's
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:48.080]   exactly what I wanted. That's what I was looking for. Great. Let me definitely buy this book."
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:52.480]   And it makes your success rate with nonfiction book buying, the rate at which you actually love
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.800]   and get something out of the books you buy, go from what would normally be for most people like
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:02.720]   50/50 to more like 90 to 95% success rate. Now, there's other reasons why I'd use Blinkist,
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:06.320]   sort of to learn about a whole new field without having to read all the books or just because
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:11.840]   they're entertaining. A lot of ways to use it. People blink in different ways, but I like to use
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:17.760]   it as a triage tool for the reading life. However you use it, it is a really useful tool. They also
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.720]   have a new feature called Blinkist Connect, which will allow you to give another person unlimited
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:30.080]   access for free. It's basically a two-for-one deal. So that's cool as well. So right now,
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:35.520]   Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience. Go to blinkist.com/deep to start

[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.840]   At the beginning of each month, I like to review the books I read in the previous month.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:13.040]   So we're in March, so I need to summarize the books I read in February, 2024.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:18.400]   As usual, my goal is to read five books a month. So here's what I read in February.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:25.840]   Number one, The Sabbath by Abraham Joshua Heschel. I wrote a newsletter post about this.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:31.760]   You can find it at calnewport.com/blog from a month or two ago from February when I finished
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:38.400]   it. Worth reading because I think it's an interesting, fantastic book. There's a secular
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:43.040]   message in this. It's not just Jewish theology. There's a secular message in this about work
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:50.160]   and what there is outside of work. It's not just about like the day of rest captures not just
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.040]   preparation to work better, but ancient Jewish scripture tells you the day of rest is about
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.360]   actually anticipating the kingdom of God to come, which is a way we can secularize that as thinking
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.920]   about rest sometimes is about rest itself, about admiring and having gratitude for the other parts
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.480]   of life that are unrelated to work. It's a short book, beautifully written from the fifties.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:14.560]   I really enjoyed it. I also really enjoyed the second book I read, which was Making Movies by
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:21.120]   Sidney Lumet. Fantastic, just nuts and bolts book about how you make a major motion picture.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:26.880]   Sidney Lumet, of course, being this fantastic director. I went back and watched several of
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:33.680]   his movies after reading this book. I watched Murder on the Orient Express, the Kenneth Branagh
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:38.640]   version, not the Kenneth Branagh version. That's the new version. His version, Sidney Lumet's
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:44.560]   version is from the 1970s as Sean Connery is in it. I also went back and I'd never seen before
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:49.920]   Dog Day Afternoon, which I really enjoyed. It's a fantastic movie, but cool book because basically
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.560]   each chapter is a different part of the movie production process and he gets into it. But a
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.960]   lot of examples from his own experiences and you really get a sense of what it's like to make a
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:04.240]   movie. If you're a cinephile or you like movies, you sort of have to read this book. I kind of
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:08.880]   embarrassed it took me this long, but I'm glad I got to it. Speaking of being embarrassed it took
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:16.960]   so long, I went ahead and read Killers of the Flower Moon by David Gran. So each year I try,
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:22.000]   my wife and I try to watch all of the movies nominated for best picture. There's 10 of them
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   now, so it could be hard, but this year we succeeded. We saw all 10. After we watched
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.480]   Killers of the Flower Moon, I wanted to read the book because I had some questions about what
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.960]   happened in the movie. And it's classic David Gran. David Gran's a great New Yorker writer.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:39.360]   He's very good at these types of books where he goes to the archives for a couple of years and
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:44.160]   pulls out these narratives with interesting, weird, flawed characters, and then lets them
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:49.760]   unfold with the pace of a mystery novel. It's a bravo performance in writing. Great book,
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:57.600]   great movie too. Very epic. I read Orthodoxy by J.K. Chesterton. I didn't like it as much
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:04.960]   as I thought. I was thinking that in his argument for the power of orthodoxy, so this is sort of
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:10.160]   Christian apologia, there would be something interesting in there about ritual and routines.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.280]   It was okay. It wasn't as powerful of an apology as I expected. It was fine. It's a short book.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:22.320]   Smart writer, but it's not punching the gut apology, so maybe worth passing on.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:31.440]   Finally, I read The Good Shepherd by C.S. Forrester, 1950s book about a convoy crossing
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:40.000]   the North Atlantic in World War II. It takes place entirely, entirely follows in real time
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.320]   the commander of a destroyer that's helping to protect this convoy. They made a movie about this
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.320]   recently, Greyhound, starring Tom Hanks. Fantastic movie. I recommend it. This is the book it's based
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:54.000]   on. I love this book. This has to be one of the original techno thrillers because what Forrester
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.480]   does here is he just throws you into this world. You never leave. It's third party, third person
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:07.040]   omniscient, right? The narrator. So you get access to the thoughts of this captain, but it's the only
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.600]   character that it follows. So he's always in the scene. You see nothing where the command, the
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.840]   captain is, it's a commander, I guess, as a destroyer. Nothing where the commander is not
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.160]   there. And the only thoughts you get access to is the commanders. The third person omniscient,
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:25.040]   but focused on a single character. And it just throws you into this like technical world. All
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.680]   the lingo, no explanation. You just sort of piece it together as it goes along, like what's going
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:35.280]   on. And it's nail biting. And he really does capture the sort of the physical stress, the
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.720]   psychological fatigue of what it was like to be under attack by a U-boat wolf pack as you're
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.920]   trying to direct these convoys across. And you begin to learn and the rhythms of like how this
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.440]   works. But it's techno thriller at its finest. It's a proto techno thriller. I'm probably going
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.480]   to buy a first edition of this. I think it'd be a cool thing to have in my collection because I
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:02.160]   love techno thrillers. And this is like a prime example of it. Fast paced in the world, surrounded
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:08.000]   by it. You begin to learn and the feeling of being in that world is transmitted. And then you make it
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.080]   through the other side, you get a sigh of relief. The Tom Hanks movie, by the way, does a fantastic
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.440]   job of capturing the feel of this book. I recommend watching Greyhound. I think it's on Apple TV plus.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.720]   Probably my favorite. That and The Sabbath were my two favorites. Making movies, killers. They
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.200]   were all, except for Orthodoxy, which was fine. The other four books I read, this was a good month,
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.160]   were really fantastic. So I'd recommend all of them. All right. Well, speaking of fantastic,
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:38.000]   what is more fantastic than me being back at my Deep Work HQ? Next week, Jesse will rejoin me.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.240]   We'll be back to our normal type of episodes and our normal type of topics, et cetera. I'm just
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:51.040]   really happy to be back. Check out Slow Productivity, my new book. If you like the type of
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.360]   things you hear about at the show, you can find it anywhere that books are sold. I'll be back next
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:02.080]   week. Until then, as always, stay deep. Hey, so if you enjoyed our discussion today, I think you
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:11.360]   might also like episode 275, which gives a general system for achieving hard goals. So check that out.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:19.600]   So the question I want to dive into today is, how do you follow through on transformative goals?
