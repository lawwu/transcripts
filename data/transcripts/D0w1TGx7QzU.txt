[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.480]   the chapter which we read at the beginning, namely the twenty-fourth chapter of the book
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:18.000]   of the Acts of the Apostles, in taking verses fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.780]   Verses fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen in the twenty-fourth chapter of the book of the Acts
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.780]   of the Apostles.
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:33.880]   But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:41.280]   God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets,
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.360]   and of hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.720]   of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:01.080]   And herein do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense toward God and
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.080]   toward men.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:10.840]   Now here, as you remember in this chapter, we have one of these great dramatic incidents
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.360]   in the life and ministry of this honored servant of God, the Apostle Paul.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.760]   And what we find here is the Apostle Paul on trial.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.400]   There are many similar scenes, as you know, in this book of the Acts, but this is the
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.760]   particular one that we are looking at this evening.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.120]   The Apostle is on trial.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.120]   The Apostle is in trouble.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.680]   Certain charges are being brought against him.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.400]   He had some very bitter enemies, people who did not hesitate to call him a most pestilent
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.880]   fellow.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.800]   This great and mighty Apostle to the Gentiles, he was nothing to them but a pestilent fellow
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   whom they were anxious to get rid of and to put to death.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:07.960]   And here they are, bringing their charge before him, and they are addressing the Roman governor
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.580]   Felix.
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.400]   These opponents of his, as you remember, had hired a kind of hack orator called Tertullus
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.320]   to put their case.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:24.480]   And he states his case with a great deal of rhetorical flourish to cover over the deficiencies
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.000]   in the case that he had to present to them.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.760]   And then, after he had spoken, the Apostle Paul replies, not through another person,
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.280]   but he speaks for himself.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.840]   And what is of interest to us this evening is to notice the way in which he presented
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.000]   his defense.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   There were two sets of charges brought against him.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.080]   The one had reference to his conduct and to his behavior.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.400]   It was being suggested that he was a cause of trouble, that he was a cause of insurrection,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.480]   that he had caused a tumult and a riot, that he was a dangerous man speaking politically,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.200]   a breaker of the law, a violator of the customs of the Jews.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.640]   So that aspect of the case was presented by Tertullus, that it behoved him to listen to
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.320]   what he had got to say on behalf of his clients, because, as the man who was ultimately responsible
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.000]   for the imperial government in Rome, for the state of affairs in the land of Palestine.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.880]   Indeed, it was not only his duty, but it would be wise for him to pay attention to what they
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:50.360]   were saying, because this man, they maintained, by acts and actions, was thus an instigator
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.200]   of trouble.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.520]   Then the other part of the charge was the message which he had been preaching.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.720]   There are the two charges.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.240]   Now it is interesting, I say, to watch the defense of the apostle, because he, like the
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.320]   prosecution, divides his defense also into the two sections.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.560]   With regard to these charges that he had been causing trouble and leading to tumult and
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.000]   confusion, he gives a blank denial.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.320]   He says that they have no evidence at all, that he had only been in Jerusalem for twelve
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.680]   days, and that he had gone up on a very charitable purpose, and that he had done none of these
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.160]   things whatsoever that were being suggested by the prosecution.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.680]   He is entirely free from all such charges.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.840]   Not only had he not raised an argument or a discussion, he had gone out of his way to
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.760]   placate the Jews.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.200]   He had done everything that was in his power to be a law-abiding citizen, and he challenges
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.520]   them to produce their evidence.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.560]   They failed to produce the material witnesses, and he indicates that to them.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.120]   That is his then reply to this charge, that he is a disturber of the peace, and a man
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.200]   who is likely to be dangerous from the standpoint of Roman government and law and order.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.920]   And then he comes to the second matter, and that is what he refers to in this fourteenth
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920]   verse.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.760]   'But,' he says, 'having said neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   me.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:44.840]   But this I do confess unto thee, that after the way which they called heresy, so worship
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.400]   I the God of my fathers, etc.'
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.480]   In other words, he comes here now to this charge concerning his message.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.440]   From there, there is no denial at all.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.440]   There is no attempt to refute what they say.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   He accepts their words in this respect.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.600]   He stands by them.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.560]   Indeed, he makes it perfectly clear that he would sooner meet death than recant what he
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.000]   had been teaching, or withdraw it in any respect.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.200]   He not only admits that he has said these things, he glories in the fact that he has
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.280]   said them.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.000]   He stands by them.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.360]   Well now then, I am calling your attention to it, you see, for this very reason.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.120]   That in saying this, and in putting his defense in that form, the great apostle gives us a
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:43.400]   very wonderful statement as to what the Christian message, the Christian faith, rarely is.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.760]   You see, he is in trouble because of this preaching of this message.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.080]   If he had not preached that, he would never have been arrested.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:07:01.240]   He had been a Pharisee, a typical Pharisee, a very well-known, able Pharisee, one who
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.840]   had excelled over all others in his knowledge of the law and all the matters in which the
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.040]   Pharisees were trained.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.840]   And if he had gone on like that, he would have been the last man to be arrested and
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.080]   charged in this particular way and manner.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.840]   He is in trouble, he is on trial, for one reason only, and that is that he had become
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.240]   a Christian and that he was preaching this Christian message.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.720]   And here in his reply he says, "Well now, I confess this, I admit this, this is what
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.360]   they say about me."
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.000]   And the description of me, he says, is in its essence true.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.120]   So he repeats what it is he had been preaching, what it is he stands for, in order that he
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.680]   might enlighten them as to the content of the Christian message, the Christian faith.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.800]   And my reason, as I say, for calling your attention to it this evening, is that it does
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:04.840]   present us with the most succinct and perfect summary and epitome of the Christian message.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:11.600]   Now, my friends, what better could we do on an Easter Sunday evening such as this, than
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.960]   remind ourselves as to what is the essential message of the Christian faith?
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.000]   There is a lot of confusion in the world today about this, isn't there?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.680]   You hear on the wireless the news that people are crowding into churches on this day.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.600]   I wonder whether they all know why they are doing it.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.160]   Do they know what Christianity means?
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   Well, I don't want to be offensive, but I am prompted to ask the question for this
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:43.360]   reason, that if people only go to the place of worship, the house of God, on this one
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:49.240]   day only every year, I draw the conclusion that they don't know why they go on that
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240]   one day.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:56.440]   For if they knew why they should go today, they'd go every Sunday.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.520]   A man who really understands this doesn't only do it once a year.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.660]   This is something that he wants to be doing the whole time.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.520]   This is nothing which comes to him as just a duty or a task, that he just gets his name
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.080]   ticked off once a year.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   No, no.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   This is life to him.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.320]   It's everything as it was to the Apostle Paul.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.840]   Well, very well then, I say, let the Apostle remind us as to what this essential Christian
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.720]   message really is.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.840]   Now then, he tells us certain things about it.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:32.520]   The first thing he tells us is this, that it is a very clear message.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:40.040]   It's a very specific message, that there is really no difficulty about knowing what
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.120]   Christianity really is, and what it stands for, and what it proclaims.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.080]   Now, let me show you that.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.280]   Take, for instance, what Tertullus says about it.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.400]   Even Tertullus, you know, understood a little bit about this.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.600]   Listen to what Tertullus says.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.040]   Let me read verse 5 to you.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.080]   This is a part of his charge.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.080]   We have found this man, he says, a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.920]   the Jews throughout the world.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.640]   All that was wrong, but this is right.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.760]   And a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.560]   The sect of the Nazarene.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.760]   You see the importance of that term.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.000]   This man, he says, is a ringleader of that new sect, the Nazarenes.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.360]   And at once he's telling us that Christianity is something that can be defined.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.480]   It's a sect, and it is something that is believed by this particular sect.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.720]   It's the sect of the Nazarenes.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:47.400]   These Nazarenes, he's saying, believe something that the vast majority of Jews don't believe,
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.560]   and nobody else believes it.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.600]   Until a few years ago, he's saying, there was no such thing as this sect of the Nazarenes.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.520]   But here it is now, and this is one of the ringleaders.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.920]   And these people, they've got some certain strange beliefs, and they meet together because
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.320]   of these beliefs, and they sing about them, and they preach about them, and they talk
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.520]   to one another about them.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.680]   The sect of the Nazarenes.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.120]   It's something discreet.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.160]   It's something that can be defined.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.160]   It is something which is circumscribed.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:27.520]   But you see, the apostle takes up this point, and he agrees, as I say, with his accuser
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.520]   Tartullus.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:39.160]   Here he is saying, "Here, that I confess this," he says, "I confess unto thee, that after
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:50.840]   the way, the manner, which they call heresy," that's again, schism, or a sect.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.480]   You notice his terms.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:12:00.480]   He says, "I admit this, that I worship the God of my fathers in a particular way."
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.880]   It's a way they don't like.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.480]   They call it a heresy.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.760]   Well now, you notice his terms.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.760]   It is a way.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.880]   It is a particular way.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.720]   The Jews thought they were worshipping God in their way.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.360]   Now here's a man who worships God in another way.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.440]   Well, very well.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.720]   If you begin to talk about another, it means that you must have some standard of judgment.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.560]   It must mean that you know what they did, and therefore what he did.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.880]   You can't say the two things are different unless you know what they are.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.360]   The moment you begin to say this and that, this way, that way, well it means that you
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.440]   know something about this way, and something about that way.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.960]   In other words, both can be defined.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:48.640]   And when you add this word heresy to it, which means again a division, a sect, or a schism,
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.640]   something which is wrong.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:55.560]   "Yes, yes, Paul, I admit this, I confess this, that after the way which they say is
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:02.000]   absolutely wrong and heretical, which is false, and which they hate, I worship the God of
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   my fathers."
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.760]   Well now then, these terms are surely of the greatest possible importance.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:16.160]   I simply want to use them this evening to enforce this particular point.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:23.360]   Christianity is something that can be defined.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:34.200]   It is not just a vague attitude which eludes definition, which deludes precise statements.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:40.440]   Now I'm emphasizing that for one reason only, that the whole climate of opinion in the world
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:49.760]   today, and alas in the Christian church, is to deny this very thing, and is to say that
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.320]   Christianity is something that cannot be defined.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.960]   "Ah," they say, "you can't define Christianity."
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.200]   They say, "if you try to do so, it's just because you're a legalist.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.560]   You've got that sort of mind."
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.480]   "Christianity," they say, "it just cannot be defined at all.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.480]   It's just a spirit.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.720]   It's the kind of spirit which you catch.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.800]   You can't put it in propositions.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.920]   You can't say this is it and that isn't it."
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.800]   "No, no," they say, "you mustn't do that.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.920]   You mustn't be petty.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.880]   You mustn't be narrow.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.760]   If a man's a good man, he's a Christian.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.960]   If a man's anxious to put an end to war, he must be a Christian.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.120]   If a man is horrified at these bombs, he must be a Christian, especially if he protests
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.840]   against these things."
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.600]   So you get these strange conglomerations of people marching along the roads together,
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:47.760]   some of them communists, some of them avowed, open rationalists and scoffers against Christianity
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:54.120]   and others calling themselves Christians, all together, all of one spirit, you see.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.560]   "No," they say, "you can't define Christianity.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.560]   You mustn't say that a man must believe this and that if he believes that, he's wrong."
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.040]   "Ah," they say, "we've outgrown all that.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.720]   People used to talk about theology and doctrine.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   That's all wrong," they say.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.080]   "What makes a man a Christian?
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.720]   Well, if he's like Christ, if he lives a life of sacrifice, if he does good, if he's kind
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.320]   and gentle, that makes him Christian."
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.560]   And there are many people who not only believe that but are like that.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.880]   You go to them and say, "Now look here, why do you call yourself a Christian?"
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.680]   They don't quite know.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:33.000]   You see, they've always been brought up to this, and they'd like to see the world a better
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   place.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.720]   And that to them is Christianity.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:45.480]   This is the common notion today, that Christianity is something that cannot be defined.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   And so, you see, it's against what we read here, this sect of the Nazarenes, this way,
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.480]   this heresy.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.480]   It's a complete contradiction of that.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:03.120]   I remember reading a book by a man, and he gave it a very imposing title a few years
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   ago.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.120]   He called it "Ultimate Questions."
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.960]   And then you read the book, and this is what you found, that Christianity is something
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.520]   so wonderful that it cannot be defined.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.760]   And he'd got a great illustration.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.600]   You see, he said it's something so beautiful, you can't put it into words.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.600]   You can't analyze, he says, things which are really beautiful.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.560]   He'd got a wonderful picture of a man who'd been told that if he got to the top of a certain
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.600]   high mountain, he'd see a view there such as he'd never seen in his life before.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.640]   From the top of that mountain, there was a wonderful panorama stretching ahead, glorious.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.300]   And the man said he'd like to see it.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.080]   So one morning, he set out early.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.680]   He walked along the roads and got to the secondary roads, and then to the byroads.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.440]   Eventually he finished with roads, and he was walking across fields.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.160]   Then he came to the foot of the mountain, and he began to climb.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.200]   And the sun began to shine, and he began to get tired.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.480]   But no, no, he went on.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.200]   He wanted to see this view, the panorama.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.640]   Up he went, and at last it got so steep that he had to go down on his hands and knees.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.960]   He was scaling crags and rocks, and his knees and his hands were bleeding.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   Doesn't matter.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.920]   He wants to see the view, and at last he arrives at the top.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:23.880]   And there, stretching before him, is this wonderful panorama, this extraordinary scene
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.880]   of it.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.640]   What does he do about it?
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.680]   Does he go home, says this man, to analyze it and to put it down as a number of propositions?
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.400]   One, two, three, four.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.080]   It's this and it isn't that.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.880]   Nonsense, says the man.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:47.000]   He just stands on top of the mountain with his eyes and his mouth wide open, speechless.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.040]   What?
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.280]   The magnificence of the scenery.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.840]   I can imagine him, says the author of the book, dancing in enjoyment.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.240]   I can imagine him bursting forth into song.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.160]   But the one thing I cannot imagine his doing, he says, is to sit down and put it down as
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.160]   a number of propositions.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.320]   This is right, that's wrong.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.720]   Ridiculous, he says.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.640]   Christianity is too big for that.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.760]   You can't say what it is and what it isn't.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.880]   You know you feel it, or else you don't feel it.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.920]   Some strange mystical experience.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.920]   That's Christianity.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:23.560]   Well, all I say is this, that if that is Christianity, the Apostle Paul would never have been arrested.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:31.440]   He was arrested because he was a ringleader of the sect, the sect of the Nazarenes.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.240]   He was a man who was guilty, they said, of heresy.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.640]   They've got a standard of judgment and the Apostle agrees entirely.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.800]   He says, "They're quite right.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.360]   I am in this position and not in their position."
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.080]   It is something that can be defined and circumscribed.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:52.360]   Now I'm calling your attention to this on this Easter Sunday.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.120]   You know there are some very funny things happening in this modern world.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.480]   There are people who hold the view of Christianity I've just been describing to you, and yet
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.120]   every Sunday they get up in their churches and they recite the Apostles' Creed and the
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.240]   Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.600]   Well, what are these creeds?
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.800]   Well, do you know what they are?
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   They're definitions.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:25.880]   They're a series of propositions, born under Pontius Pilate, dead, buried, risen again.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.880]   What are they?
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.880]   Definitions.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:33.240]   This is what makes a man a Christian.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:39.320]   And every confession of faith that the church has ever drawn up has been nothing but that.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.040]   You see, before the Protestant Reformation, people didn't quite know what they believed,
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.040]   but at the moment the Protestant Reformation came, people knew exactly what they believed.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.680]   And what they did was to draw up their definitions.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   What are they?
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.200]   Well, there's one of them, the 39 Articles of the Church of England.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.720]   You probably read many of you an article by a great dignitary in the Church of England
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:04.320]   the other day, agitating for a new kind of articles, why he doesn't believe this.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.360]   He's still a dignitary of the church, you see, but he doesn't believe what he claims
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.560]   to believe and what he's pledged himself to believe and to preach.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.560]   39 articles.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.560]   What are they?
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:19.560]   Well, they're here to tell us what to believe, what not to believe.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.560]   Definitions.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.560]   They say, "This is Christianity, that isn't Christianity.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.920]   The Church of Rome is wrong, this is right."
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.000]   That's what you mean by your 39 articles.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.600]   And they say you can't define Christianity.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:42.540]   And think of the great Westminster Confession of Faith, drawn up there in Westminster Abbey,
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.000]   in that great conference that met for almost three years in order to hammer out these definitions.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   What for?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.040]   Well, that the common people of this land might know what to believe and what not to
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.040]   believe.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.480]   The Westminster Confession of Faith.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.740]   In other words, the church in every period of revival and reformation always knows exactly
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.040]   what she believes.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.960]   And my dear friends, the world is as it is tonight, and the church is as she is tonight,
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.920]   for the reason that people don't know what they believe.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.000]   They say, "I'm a Christian."
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   You say, "What do you mean?"
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   "I don't know."
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Well, we must know.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.840]   "Oh yes," says the Apostle Paul, "to that extent this man Tertullus is right.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:32.960]   This I do confess, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:39.840]   my fathers, believing all things that are written in the law and in the prophets, and
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.720]   of hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.040]   from the dead, both of the just and the unjust.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:54.600]   And herein I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense toward God and
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.600]   toward men."
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.960]   "This," he says, "is what I do believe.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.120]   This is what I have done.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.120]   I have preached this.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.120]   I believe this.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.360]   I stand by this.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.360]   Do what you like to me."
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   Well, what is this?
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   Well, let's look at his definition of Christianity this evening.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.720]   I only want to hold the elements of it before you.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.600]   The first thing you notice that it includes is this, is a belief in God.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:31.120]   "A belief in God, so worship I the God of my fathers."
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.520]   You can't be a Christian if you don't believe in God.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:42.920]   I don't care how good a man is, I don't care how wonderful his life, I don't care how tender
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:53.600]   and kind and loving his personality, if he doesn't believe in and worship God, he's not
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   a Christian.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.480]   "I worship the God of my fathers.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.820]   This is common ground to the Jews who are accusing Paul and Paul himself.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.640]   They all believed in God."
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.040]   The apostle is constantly making that point as he went around preaching.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.340]   Whenever he preached to Jews, he had no need to stay with this point.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.340]   It was common ground.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.320]   They believed in God, the God of our fathers.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.320]   The pagans didn't.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.080]   They were worshipping idols, gods of their own imagination and their own creation.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.360]   And Paul had to turn upon them and say, "Don't waste your time in worshipping these vanities
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.360]   any longer.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.360]   Turn away from them.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:39.840]   There is only one true and living God."
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.360]   Do you believe in God, my friend?
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:54.740]   God the Creator, the God who exists from eternity to eternity, the Great I Am, the God who made
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:24:00.560]   everything that is, the God who reigns over all.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:11.840]   Yes, but you notice that he says that God is to be worshipped, God is to be obeyed.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.000]   There is nothing, I admit, that so alarms me and frightens me, as when a man says to
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   me, "Of course I believe in God.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.920]   I've always believed in God."
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:28.600]   I don't think a man who believes in God speaks like that about him.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:35.840]   To believe in God is to believe in one who dwells in a light that is unapproachable,
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   whom no man has ever seen or can see.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:48.520]   The Lord of the universe, the Creator of the ends of the earth, God in all his glory and
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.840]   majesty and eternity.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.960]   You read this book and you'll find that some people have been given some vague intimation
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.440]   of his presence and his nearness, and you know what happens to them?
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.680]   They fall down before him.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:08.520]   Isaiah, the prophet, was given such a vision, and he cries out, saying, "Woe is unto me,
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.040]   for I am a man of unclean lips.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.920]   I am undone," he says.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   He can't stand in the presence of this God.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.680]   God is to be worshipped.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   God is to be obeyed.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.040]   A Christian is a man who believes that.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.440]   Let me hurry on.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:33.680]   "After the way which they call heresy," says the apostle, "so worship I the God of my
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   fathers."
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.520]   Now, that's an interesting addition, isn't it?
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.120]   What's it mean, "the God of my fathers"?
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.680]   He's referring to the Jews.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.920]   Paul was a Jew, and the Jews were the accusers at this point.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.800]   Now, he says, "Here again we've got common ground.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.920]   I have always worshipped the God that they've worshipped, the God of my fathers."
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.120]   Oh, but what a pregnant statement that is.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.160]   What's he mean by that?
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.760]   He means this.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:13.320]   God is not merely that great and eternal being about whom I've been speaking so unworthily.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:20.360]   God has not only made and created the world as a watchmaker might make a watch, winds
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.360]   it up and then puts it down and lets it carry on itself.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.720]   No, no.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   God is a God who intervenes, God of my fathers.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   What fathers?
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:40.280]   Well, the first of them was Abraham, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.480]   What Paul is saying is this.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.920]   I not only believe in God, I believe in the God revealed in the Old Testament.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.840]   You notice how he goes on to put it.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.560]   He says here that he has always believed all things which are written in the law, the books
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.960]   of Moses, and the prophets, the remainder, if you like, of the Old Testament.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.560]   I've always believed that, says Paul.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:07.880]   And what an important addition it is, because you see it means this.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.160]   He believes that this great and everlasting and eternal God, the creator of all things
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:19.720]   that are and the sustainer of everything, is a God who has intervened in life and in
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.040]   this world.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.320]   He believes that God created everything at the beginning, always believed that.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:31.400]   He believed that men had fallen and had sinned and rebelled against God and had brought his
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.680]   world into trouble.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.760]   Yes, but he says, I worship the God of my fathers.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.000]   And that means this.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.640]   That at a given point in time God had looked upon a man called Abraham who lived in Ur
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.920]   of the Chaldeas.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.840]   And he'd said to this man, "Come, get up, come out.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.840]   I want to send you to a land that you know nothing about.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.320]   I'm going to turn you into a nation.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.720]   I'm going to use you and the nation that will come out of your lines as a means of
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.400]   blessing to all the nations of the world.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:16.360]   God of my fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, the God who appeared
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   to Abraham.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.280]   There he was without a child from Sarah, his wife, Abraham, age ninety-nine, Sarah
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.920]   over ninety.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.560]   And God said, "Sarah is going to conceive and bear a son.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.000]   This is the one through whom I'm going to send my Messiah, God of my fathers."
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   He believed that.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.920]   He'd always believed it and taught it.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.560]   God creating a nation for himself.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.560]   What for?
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:48.480]   Well, in order to give a revelation of himself, in order to bear witness of himself.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.760]   All the nations of the world had fallen away from God.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.200]   They didn't know God.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:59.040]   They believed in gods in stones and in trees, spirits in animals, and they believed in the
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.120]   sun and the moon and the stars.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.120]   There were their gods.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.640]   "No, no," says God, "I'm going to raise up a nation and a people to bear witness
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.560]   and testimony unto me that I alone am God and that there's none other.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.720]   I will speak to them.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.160]   I will reveal myself and God of my fathers."
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.840]   He believes that.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.880]   And it's a very important addition, my friend.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.400]   This man, the apostle Paul, believed the Old Testament, you see.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:37.000]   He believed the book of Genesis and Exodus and Leviticus and Numbers and Deuteronomy
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.640]   and all the historical books and the Psalms and the prophets.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.080]   He said these are the living oracles of God.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.440]   God gave them to our fathers.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.920]   He didn't give them to the other nations.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   He gave them to us.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.680]   He believes in revelation.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.320]   He doesn't believe, in other words, that a man finds out about God by thinking and
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.840]   by reasoning and by using his own mind.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.600]   He doesn't say, "Now this is the God that I believe in, a God who is entirely a God
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   of love.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.160]   I don't believe that God could have any wrath in him.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.920]   I don't believe in a God of justice.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.040]   I don't believe in a God who sat on Mount Sinai."
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.040]   No, no.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:15.360]   "The God I believe in is a wonderful God of love who smiles indiscriminately upon everybody."
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.120]   That isn't the God that Paul believed in.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.800]   He's a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.240]   He's one of the leaders of the Christian church.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.800]   He believes in the God of our fathers, this God that has revealed himself.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:37.000]   What he's saying is this, "All that I know about God is what God has revealed concerning
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   himself.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   I've always believed it.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   I've accepted it.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.520]   He's a God who's concerned about men.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.400]   He's a God who's intervened in the affairs of men.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.400]   I believe that.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.920]   I've always believed it."
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.200]   The Christian believes that.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.760]   Then let me hurry on.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.560]   This revelation, I say, what is it?
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.240]   Well, he divides it up for us.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:00.320]   All things that are written in the law and the prophets.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.520]   The law.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:09.360]   The apostle Paul, you see, believed in the Ten Commandments.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.800]   That there's only one God and that we are not to bow down before anybody or anything
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.480]   else.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:20.560]   That we are not to take the name of this God in vain or take his day in vain.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.520]   He believed that God had said, "Thou shalt not kill.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.200]   Thou shalt not steal.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.560]   Thou shalt not commit adultery."
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.600]   He wasn't too clever and too sophisticated to believe things like that, like people are
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.560]   today and say that if a man's tired of his wife, let him have another.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.680]   Or if he finds he's made a mistake, let him spit upon it and go on.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.680]   No, no.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.280]   He said, "God has said."
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.160]   He believed the law.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.000]   That a man must not even covet his neighbor's wife or any of his neighbor's possessions.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.280]   He believed the law, the whole of the law.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.960]   He believed, in other words, that God had revealed there his own holy character.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.280]   That he had called Moses up onto the mount and had said, "Moses, I want you to go down
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.680]   and tell the people what I am and what I'm like.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.680]   I am God.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.120]   Tell them this.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:15.880]   I am holy and I am to be worshipped as a holy God.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.160]   Be ye holy for I am holy.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   You are my people.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160]   Live like this therefore."
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.840]   The God who had revealed his character, his holiness.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:30.680]   Yes, but not only his holiness, but his righteousness.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:36.560]   The God who had revealed that he is the judge of men.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.960]   And so he had told Moses about offering sacrifices.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.960]   Have you read those books?
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.720]   Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, all about burnt offerings and sacrifices.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.000]   It was God who told Moses all about it.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.120]   And he said, "You go down now and build an ark, build a temple, build a tabernacle according
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.120]   to the measurements.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.720]   See that they'll do all things according to the pattern shown thee on the mount."
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.520]   He gave him the detailed instructions and measurements.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.160]   Told them what animals they were to offer, how they were to present the blood.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.800]   God told Moses that.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   Moses did it.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.160]   Paul believed it.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.120]   But what does it all tell us?
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:20.040]   Well what it tells us is not only about the holy character of God, but that God wants
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.320]   us to be holy also.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.600]   And that if we are not, he will punish us.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.040]   That he is a judge eternal.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:37.240]   And that there is only one way whereby we can be reconciled to him, and that is by offering
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:42.920]   blood to him, taking a sacrifice into his holy presence.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.440]   "Oh yes, I've always believed in the God of my fathers.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.520]   I've always worshipped him," says Paul.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.480]   "I believe in his teaching about the way men are to live.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.880]   And my friends, it's here still this evening.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.520]   That is how God wants all of us to live."
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.720]   And commandments, moral law, and not only the law but the prophets.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   What have these said?
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:09.160]   "Well," says the apostle, "these prophets and have hope toward God, which they themselves
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.720]   also allow."
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.320]   The prophets have written, and what have they written about?
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:19.880]   Well, the prophets were concerned to give the people a true view of the law of God.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.400]   You see, some of them had got a wrong view of the law of God.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.440]   Some of them were saying, "All right, it doesn't matter what you do.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.960]   If you do fall into sin and so on, all you need do is to take your burnt offering or
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.560]   sacrifice to the temple next Sunday, and all will be well."
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.680]   You carry on in sin, they said, then take your offering, like so many of us do, you
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.680]   see.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.480]   We do wrong, then we give a good donation to a good cause.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.480]   We feel it's balanced.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.880]   Or we go and confess to some priest, so-called, and we think we're all right.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.120]   No, no, we balance good with evil.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.120]   That's what they'd been doing.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:57.600]   The prophets arose, sent by God, and they said, "Look here, you can't buy God.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.480]   God's not interested in your burnt offerings and sacrifices if that's the spirit in which
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:05.360]   you take them.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.120]   God wants a pure heart.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.000]   God wants repentance.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   God wants honesty.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.120]   And he can't be bought in this manner."
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.080]   The prophets, they taught that.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.720]   But they taught something more wonderful, and it was this.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:28.120]   They said that though this people had so sinned against God, that God in his love was going
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.440]   to send them a deliverer, a messiah.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:38.240]   Someone was going to come who was the representative of God, and he would deliver the people.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.440]   "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God."
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   Why?
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.000]   "Well, there's a great king coming.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.960]   Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.000]   Make straight in the wilderness the highway."
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Of who?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.680]   "Of your God.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.160]   All flesh shall see the salvation of God."
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.800]   The prophets all said that in different ways.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:06.120]   They were looking for the coming one, a hope, he says, and a hope toward God, which they
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.440]   themselves also are looking for.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.680]   And the hope is the coming of the messiah.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   They were all looking for it.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.880]   "So was I," he says, "Paul.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.960]   I've always done that.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.920]   I've always worshipped the God of my fathers in this way."
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:24.320]   And then you notice the last thing he mentions is that there is to be a resurrection of the
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:34.000]   dead, birth of the just and the unjust.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.720]   And a hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:45.120]   of the dead, birth of the just and the unjust.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:52.040]   "Now," says Paul, "I am, I confess, I acknowledge it, ringleader of the sect of
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.040]   the Nazarenes, as they call us.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:37:00.320]   I admit that according to the way which they describe as heresy, I am worshipping the God
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.720]   of my fathers.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:10.840]   And I believe that there is to be a resurrection of the dead, just and unjust."
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.520]   I believe it, says Paul.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:16.200]   This you see is an essential part of the belief of a Christian.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:20.600]   Paul is giving us here items one, two, three, four of what a Christian believes.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.120]   This is what I stand for, he says.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:27.960]   And this is one of them, my friends, that there is to be a resurrection of the dead
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:36.240]   and of all the dead, birth of the just and the unjust.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:44.360]   "That every person who has ever died in this world, or whoever will die, shall rise
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:52.800]   again in the body and stand before God."
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.040]   I believe it, says Paul.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   I've always believed it.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.960]   They believe it, they are with me there.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.520]   We are on common ground, says the apostle.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:06.520]   Resurrection of the dead, birth of the just and the unjust.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.600]   The whole world will stand before God.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:15.320]   Men and women will rise out of their graves, and those who have drowned in the sea, they'll
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.760]   all rise and they'll stand at that great day before God.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:27.120]   There is a judgment, a last judgment, a final judgment, and the whole of humanity will stand
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:34.080]   before God, just and unjust.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:38.160]   Those who have believed in God and who have lived to please him, and those who haven't
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.640]   believed in him and have never thought to please him, they'll all rise together and
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:49.120]   stand before God.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.160]   That is what I believe, says Paul.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.880]   My friends, shall I ask you a simple question?
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.040]   Do you believe all that?
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   Are you a Christian?
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.840]   Well, if you're a Christian, you must believe all this.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.120]   Here's an authority speaking.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.640]   Here is this mighty apostle to the Gentiles, the men who planted more churches than anybody
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.360]   else, the men who brought this gospel first to this continent of Europe.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.120]   Here is the mighty apostle of God, and this is what he believes.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.640]   He believes in God.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.640]   He worships him.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.640]   He serves him.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:29.080]   He is the God of the fathers, the whole story of God's action through the Jews, the making
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.560]   of the Jews, what he did with them.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:36.880]   He believes it all, believes the Old Testament, believes the law as an expression of God's
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:45.280]   character and God's will for men, believes in the prophets and their teaching, believes
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.280]   in the resurrection.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.280]   Do you?
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:55.720]   You can't be a Christian unless you believe these things.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.120]   This is what I believe, says Paul.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.120]   They're right.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.640]   That's what I stand for.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.400]   That's what I've been preaching.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.880]   Do you believe it, my friend?
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:11.240]   As you sit in that seat there in this chapel this evening, do you believe that one day
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:18.000]   you will be standing in the presence of this eternal God?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.880]   You believe that?
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:27.080]   Is your life governed and determined by that thought, "You can't serve God unless it is"?
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.760]   Do you really believe that?
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.120]   Have you visualized yourself there?
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:40.120]   Resurrected, risen, death is not the end, the grave is not the end.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:45.240]   Put your tombstones on it, put tongues upon it, it doesn't matter, it'll all be moved.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:50.120]   You'll rise.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:57.240]   Resurrection of the just and the unjust and standing before God, giving an account of
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.600]   the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.920]   You call yourself a Christian?
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.560]   Do you believe that?
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.280]   Are these the things by which you live?
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.000]   Are these the things to which you hold?
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.600]   Are these the things which you proclaim?
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:19.880]   The apostle says, "I believe all these things."
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:26.240]   Will you be surprised if I now go on to say this?
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:33.760]   That so far I haven't started presenting to you the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.960]   I haven't come to Christianity yet.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.720]   What the apostle is saying here is this, "I have held this as they have."
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.120]   This is common ground.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:48.800]   The Jews who were persecuting Paul, who were to tell us to bring the charge against him,
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.240]   they believed all those things, every one of them.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.720]   That's not Christianity.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.840]   That's the introduction to Christianity.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.080]   That's Judaism.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.760]   That's the Jews' religion.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.560]   Every Orthodox Jew tonight believes all that.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.800]   There were some I know, the Sadducees and others, who no longer believed in resurrection.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.920]   They had gone astray.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:13.040]   But the Pharisees, the real men who understood all this, they believed in all this, and they
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.600]   taught it and preached it.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.320]   This is common ground.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.480]   This isn't Christianity.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.720]   I haven't come to it.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.920]   What is Christianity then?
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:32.080]   Well, I can tell you very briefly and very simply.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:36.160]   Do you know, my dear friends, if the apostle Paul had only believed what I've been saying
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.000]   up until this moment, he wouldn't have been a prisoner.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.360]   He wouldn't have been on trial.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.360]   Why?
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.840]   Well, he'd just have been a typical representative Jew.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.360]   He would still have been the Pharisee.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:51.120]   As a Pharisee, he preached and taught all that I've said.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.400]   That isn't what makes a man a Christian.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.240]   You can believe in God and not be a Christian.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.940]   You can believe in the Ten Commandments and not be a Christian.
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.800]   You can be a moral man and not be a Christian.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.940]   You can be a highly religious man and not be a Christian.
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:12.380]   You can believe your Old Testament, every word of it, and not be a Christian.
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.280]   You can believe that there is life after death and not be a Christian.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.940]   You can believe in the resurrection and not be a Christian.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:26.840]   You can believe in the Last Judgment and not be a Christian.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.480]   What is it that makes a man a Christian?
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.160]   Oh, that he belongs to the sect of the Nazarenes.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.680]   But tell us, Nee, what he was talking about.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:40.080]   This man, he says, is not only a pestilent fellow, but he is a ringleader of this sect
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.360]   of the Nazarenes.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:48.760]   This is the thing that makes a man a Christian and separates him even from the Jews.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.760]   What does it mean?
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.160]   Well, it's something that you can define, my friend.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.160]   It's this, you see.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.480]   It's all about this Nazarene, Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.740]   It's all about him.
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:02.740]   And what was it?
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:08.000]   He says, "For I admit it, I confess it, that after the way that they call heresy, so worship
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.360]   I the God of my fathers."
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:16.000]   Again, he says in verse 21, "Except it be for this one voice that I cried, standing
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.240]   among them, touching the resurrection of the dead, I am called in question by you this
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.240]   day."
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.240]   What is Christianity?
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   It's this.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:30.400]   It's about this Jesus, about this Nazarene.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:35.800]   It means that you've left something else and have believed in him and have gone after him.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.800]   What do you believe?
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.800]   I'll give you my headings.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.720]   They are these.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:50.960]   It is to believe, first and foremost, that he is the fulfillment of all the prophecies
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.160]   and the hope of the Jews.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:45:00.160]   You know, says Paul, "I have hope toward God," which they themselves also allow.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.120]   They've read their prophets and they know that the prophets are saying that a Messiah
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.120]   is to come.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.440]   "Do you know the difference between me and them?" said Paul to Felix.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.440]   It's this.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.840]   They say he's still to come.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.840]   I say he's come.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:22.640]   Jesus, the Nazarene, the Messiah, long promised.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.880]   But why did he say that he'd come?
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:32.440]   Here is the essential message of Christianity.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:41.520]   It had been proved by the resurrection that he is the Messiah, the Son of God.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.280]   It's not surprising that Paul puts it like that here.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.160]   In writing his letter subsequently to the Romans, he puts it like this.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.800]   He says that he's been called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of God concerning
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:01.640]   his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:09.360]   and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.360]   resurrection from the dead.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:16.280]   Here it is.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:24.400]   You see, these first preachers, these apostles of Jesus Christ, they went round the world
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   preaching Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.760]   This was their message.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.400]   They said, "You know, this Jesus whom we followed, we thought he was a great prophet.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.280]   He made some extraordinary statements.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.560]   He claimed that he was the Son of God.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.160]   He worked miracles such as we'd never seen before.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.800]   We couldn't understand him.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.200]   And yet we did begin to believe that he was the coming Messiah.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:55.320]   But you know, they said he was taken, and they tried him, and they condemned him, and
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.480]   they crucified him, and he didn't seem to have any power to resist.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.280]   And we saw him nailed to a tree, and he died, and they buried him in a grave.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:12.120]   We had thought that it had been he that was the deliverer, but he's dead.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:19.720]   And we were utterly dumbfounded and disconsolate and dejected.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:25.800]   And we were gathered together when suddenly certain women who'd been watching at the
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.280]   tomb came running and bursting in upon us and said, "The tomb is empty.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.520]   He's not there."
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.520]   We didn't believe them.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.280]   We thought they were talking idle tales.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.400]   But we went, two of us went, Peter and John went to see.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.840]   And there we found they were right.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.960]   The grave was empty.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.160]   He wasn't there.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.160]   And he's appeared to us.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.160]   We were in a room together.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.920]   We'd bolted the doors and shut the windows because of the Jews.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.360]   And suddenly he came amongst us and stood there and said, "Look at me."
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:54.680]   And he sat down and he had broiled fish and a honeycomb.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.920]   He said, "Don't be afraid of me.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.920]   I'm not a ghost.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.160]   I'm not a phantom.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.200]   I'm not some materialization of some spiritual body.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.880]   I'm flesh and bones before you.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.400]   I'm risen in the body from the grave.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:11.480]   I'm giving you proof of it."
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:17.160]   And we realized that he was the Son of God.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:23.120]   He'd always said that he was, but there by rising from the dead he proves it.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:29.560]   Later on this apostle said the same thing to Festus and Agrippa when he said that he
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:38.120]   should be the first that should rise from the dead.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:43.600]   And he is the first that has risen from the dead.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:49.840]   Lazarus was merely, as it were, resuscitated for a while and he died again.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:57.080]   Jairus' daughter, the son of the woman of Nain, were only resuscitated.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.360]   They were not resurrected.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:06.920]   Jairus is the first and the only one that has been resurrected, the first that should
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.480]   rise from the dead.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   He's Jesus.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   He's God.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.480]   He's the Messiah.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.240]   The resurrection proves it.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.640]   He is the fulfillment of all the prophets.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.920]   We are not waiting for him.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.920]   He's come.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:31.400]   Not only that, he said, "I believe that he has likewise fulfilled the law."
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.760]   The law condemns us all.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.400]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.760]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.960]   But this Jesus is the Savior.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.520]   How do I know it?
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:50.840]   Well, the resurrection again.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:59.320]   He is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world, delivered for our offenses,
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:03.000]   raised again for our justification.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   What's it mean?
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.520]   It means this.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:12.760]   What was happening on Calvary's hill was that God was putting your sins and mine upon
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.760]   his Son.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:19.840]   He bore our sins in his own body on the tree.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.000]   He was made an offering for sin.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.920]   He is the Lamb of God.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.200]   He is the sacrifice of God.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:37.360]   God smote him for our sins.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:41.760]   As under the Old Testament dispensation, they put their hands on the head of the Lamb and
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.640]   of the animal and then killed him and took his blood and presented it to God.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.080]   Here is the Lamb of God.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.160]   Our sins were laid upon him.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.200]   God smote him.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.440]   He punished our sins in him.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.440]   How do I know that?
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.320]   How do I know that God has done so and that I am forgiven?
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:04.320]   The answer is the resurrection.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.560]   He has fulfilled the law of God.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   He has given a perfect obedience to it.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   He never sinned.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.360]   He never failed.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.080]   There was no blemish in him.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.400]   And there he has taken the punishment.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:24.640]   The law of God is answered, is satisfied.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:32.520]   He is the fulfillment of the law of God.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:43.800]   And therefore, says Paul, this is what I preach, that this is the Savior, the Messiah.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.760]   My opponents believe in the coming of a Messiah who is going to deliver.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:55.880]   I say that Jesus is the Messiah and that he has delivered.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:01.520]   And that therefore there is only one way of salvation and one way to God.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:09.000]   I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.440]   my fathers.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.320]   I used to be like that.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.760]   I used to take my burnt offerings and sacrifices as they still do.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:21.200]   I have stopped it.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:28.960]   I have learned that not the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer can
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:36.120]   cleanse a conscience from dead works and cleanse and purify a man and admit him into the presence
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.080]   of God and make him a son of God.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.400]   It cannot.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.880]   I have ceased to believe this.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:48.680]   I believe in this Jesus, this Nazarene.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:55.880]   I believe that there is only one way of entering into the holiest of all.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:01.520]   And that is by the blood of Jesus.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.360]   They call it heresy.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.920]   I call it life.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:11.920]   I thought I knew God but I did not know God.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:17.760]   There is but one way, he said, into the presence of God.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.800]   It is by Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.880]   He is the Son of God.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.320]   He is the Savior of the world.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:31.040]   There is none other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.720]   I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:43.680]   Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:55.040]   I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:03.640]   our sins according to the Scriptures and that he was raised from the dead according to the
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.640]   Scriptures.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:12.200]   That is it, Christ, Jesus, the Nazarene.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:23.880]   The only way from man to God, the only way to be forgiven, the only way to be reconciled
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:34.720]   to God, the only way to be made a child of God, the only way to have new life and power,
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:44.280]   to lose the fear of death and the grave and the resurrection and the judgment to come,
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:50.320]   Jesus, the Nazarene.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:59.200]   It is all through him, his body broken, his blood shed.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:10.600]   For me and for my sins, God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:23.560]   Jesus Christ, by which the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:36.280]   The sect of the Nazarenes, Jesus as Savior, dying for sins, risen for our justification,
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:46.520]   the only Savior, but a complete Savior for all who believe in him.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:56.200]   That, my friends, is the apostles' account of the Christian faith.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:06.040]   That is what makes a man a Christian, not only to believe in God, not only to do good
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:19.800]   and to be good, not only to believe in the law and the prophets, not only to be religious,
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:27.000]   but to realize that you are a condemned and a hopeless sinner, and that nothing you may
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:36.440]   ever do will ever save you, but that Christ, the Son of God, came into this world to die
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:41.480]   for you, to save you, to reconcile you to God.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:49.680]   Proof of it is given in his resurrection, to believe in him, just as you are, without
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:57:00.240]   one plea, with everything against you, simply believing his word, as Abraham believed it,
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:05.080]   that Sarah should have a child, though she is over ninety and he is nearly a hundred.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.080]   Nonsense!
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   But he believed it.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.080]   He did not stagger.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.520]   He believed, hoping against hope.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:18.400]   And you and I must believe in exactly the same way.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:29.360]   Though you are a vile and a wretched sinner, you must believe that if you believe on Jesus
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:38.000]   as the Son of God and one who died for you and your sins to reconcile you to God, that
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:48.320]   you are forgiven this minute and are made a child of God and of a hope of everlasting
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.320]   bliss.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:52.440]   Do you know what you believe?
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:55.360]   Do you know in whom you believe?
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:08.600]   Do you belong to the sect of the Nazarenes, and do you rejoice in it?
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.800]   Amen.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:13.720]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
