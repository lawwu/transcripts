[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.840]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.920]   John Piper returns home tomorrow
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.520]   from a very busy holiday travel schedule.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.280]   He preached three times at the Campus Outreach
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.760]   New Year's Conference in Milwaukee
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.180]   and then turned around and preached
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.660]   at the Passion Conference in Atlanta.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.760]   Busy times, but good times and much grace.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.520]   And in the meantime, we've been served well
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.880]   by guest Dr. Don Whitney, who joins us one last time.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.280]   Thank you, Don.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.300]   Don serves as professor of biblical spirituality
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.680]   and associate dean of the School of Theology
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.480]   at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.680]   He is known for his modern day classic book,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.360]   "Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life"
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.620]   and he is also the author of the new book from Crossway
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.200]   titled "Praying the Bible".
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.240]   And yesterday we talked about the two most important
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.120]   spiritual disciplines, which was so helpful.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.580]   And today I wanna ask you about
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.920]   the hardest spiritual discipline.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.960]   I know this is a question you get all the time.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.020]   So in your experience, what personal spiritual discipline
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.000]   is the most difficult to pull off successfully?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.060]   - My personal observation and conversations
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.140]   with many people over this subject
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.040]   is that the most difficult discipline
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.600]   to practice consistently is fasting.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.800]   And fasting is one of those disciplines
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.880]   that everybody knows about.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120]   You know, it's mentioned in the Bible actually
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.360]   more often than something as important as baptism.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.000]   About 77 times by my count, fasting is mentioned
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.680]   to about 75 times that baptism is mentioned in the Bible.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.320]   And so people know it's there, but they don't practice it.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.720]   I mean, for example, we go to Matthew chapter four,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.000]   Luke chapter four, okay, Jesus fast 40 days,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.760]   then he's tempted by the devil.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.880]   Let's talk about how he quoted scripture to the devil.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.040]   So we know it's there, we just sort of pass over
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.960]   this 40 days of fasting kind of idea.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.520]   And people will not practice
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   what they're not taught to practice.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.360]   I mean, by and large, people will not practice
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.040]   what they've not been taught to practice.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.760]   If they've not been taught fasting,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.960]   they're not likely to practice fasting.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.300]   And if someone isn't practicing fasting,
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.200]   they're not likely to be an advocate of fasting.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.280]   It's very hard to get up and preach a sermon on fasting
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.280]   or to teach a lesson on fasting when you don't fast.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.000]   If you're not practicing it,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.640]   it's hard to be a very persuasive advocate of it.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.280]   So I think that's one of the main reasons people don't fast,
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.480]   they just never heard anything about it.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.840]   But even for people who know
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.640]   the biblical teaching on fasting well,
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.260]   it's still hard to practice
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.000]   because of all the other disciplines,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.980]   you feel in your body.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.600]   When you practice this discipline,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.760]   you feel the absence of food and it's uncomfortable.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.360]   And we don't like to feel uncomfortable.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.300]   And John Piper has a great teaching on this
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.280]   in his book, "A Hunger for God."
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.920]   I love that title, I think more than all of his titles,
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.600]   because he says, "Fasting is really
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.200]   "when your hunger for God exceeds your hunger
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.160]   "for the food God made you to live on."
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.880]   That is, there never a time when your hunger for God
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.700]   to answer a prayer, to move in your life,
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.160]   to move in a situation exceeds your hunger
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.560]   for the food God made you to live on.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.200]   So fasting, seen from that perspective, is refreshing.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.160]   And the most important thing, I think,
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.640]   about the practice of fasting that would help people,
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.200]   besides the recognition that Jesus does expect
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.640]   his people to fast, we see that in the gospels.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.600]   But the most important thing is to fast
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.840]   for a biblical purpose.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.680]   In one of my books, I summarize 10 biblical purposes
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.720]   found in scripture for fasting.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.280]   For example, for answered prayer is a common one there.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.320]   I think when most people fast,
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.240]   they just see it as something to endure.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.760]   Okay, the Bible says to fast,
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.520]   I'm not gonna eat for 24 hours.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.920]   And the whole time, their stomach growls,
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.080]   their headaches, and they think, man, I'm hungry.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   Their next thought is, oh, that's right,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.520]   I'm hungry because I'm fasting.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.720]   And their next thought is, how much time till this is over?
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.320]   And it's just something to be endured.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.720]   It's a miserable, self-centered experience.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.900]   Instead, it should look something like this.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.880]   When your stomach growls, when your headaches,
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.440]   you say, man, I'm hungry.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.640]   Your next thought's gonna be, oh, that's right,
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.640]   I'm hungry because I'm fasting today.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.780]   Your next thought should be,
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.780]   and I'm fasting for this purpose.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.320]   So let's say your purpose is to pray
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.340]   for your child's salvation.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.120]   Every time during the day that you get hungry,
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.560]   that should be a prompt to pray for your child's salvation.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.520]   The result is you're praying
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.800]   for your child's salvation all day long.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.400]   That's what you wanted to do.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.280]   Therefore, your hunger serves you.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.380]   Your hunger serves your greater purpose.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.000]   Your greater purpose is not to endure hunger.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Your greater purpose is to see your child saved.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.960]   So that failure to see fasting
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   is just something to be endured.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.000]   The failure to fast with a particular purpose in mind
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.200]   all the way through it,
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.600]   I think is the biggest stumbling block for fasting
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.200]   to those people who know the biblical teaching about fasting.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.080]   If they don't know the biblical teaching,
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.640]   well, you can't expect people to do
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.360]   what they've never been taught to do.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.640]   But once they understand that,
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.200]   I believe the biggest problem is a failure
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.560]   to see a biblical purpose when they start.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.440]   - Yes, that is seasoned counsel
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.040]   and very practical and concrete.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.920]   Thank you, Dr. Whitney,
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.720]   and thank you for joining us for the last week
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.320]   as a guest on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.200]   - Tony, it's been a great honor to be on the podcast.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.100]   - And speaking of fasting,
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.720]   I have to mention John Piper's excellent book on the subject.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.760]   It's titled "A Hunger for God,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.820]   "Desiring God Through Fasting and Prayer."
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.280]   And you can download the entire book
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.520]   free of charge at desiringgod.org/books.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.480]   "A Hunger for God" is the title again.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.200]   We return tomorrow with John Piper himself in the flesh,
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.480]   and we will field a question from a listener
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.860]   who is enduring prolonged unemployment,
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.760]   and we'll address especially unemployment
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.160]   for those who are enduring what has been coined
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.760]   a quarter-life crisis.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.080]   There's so many 20-somethings
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.900]   that cannot get their foot into a good career,
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.360]   and it leads to tensions and questions.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.720]   Piper returns tomorrow to address this situation.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.640]   And for anything and everything you need to know
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.320]   or ask or get regarding this podcast,
