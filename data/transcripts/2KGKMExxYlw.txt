[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.480]   All right, let's move on to a question now from Andre.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.760]   Andre says, "How do I filter the noise of morning news,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.360]   such as the stock market or politics,
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.880]   and quickly get back into deep work without missing anything important?"
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.000]   Here's how you filter. You don't look at it at all, Andre.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.240]   If you're a hedge fund manager,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.360]   or you work on the staff of the president, okay,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.400]   you need to be up to speed first thing in the morning on the stock market and
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.960]   politics. If you are not either of those things, we'll be okay,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.560]   Andre, without you being up to speed and having your take.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.000]   There is not going to be some crisis that happens where they say, "Oh my God,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.640]   I hope Andre is on this," because, you know,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.920]   Omicron is coming or the stock market is moving. It's okay.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.400]   You can focus on things that are going on in your life that really do require
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.880]   your attention and significantly reduce the
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.560]   amount of time and energy you invest in news.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200]   And something I've been saying recently,
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.200]   and this is very specific to our current moment,
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.040]   I think we are in a current moment now where most of us should be and should not
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.480]   feel bad about doing a massive reduction in our news consumption.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.320]   Now I know an informed populace is important.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.600]   This is not a general piece of advice. I don't think in general,
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.520]   you should completely be disconnected from the world and the world of news.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.320]   But I think in this current moment, you should.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.560]   There's a mental health imperative that's going on right now.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.760]   The news will degrade your energy.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.520]   It will degrade your focus. If you're already prone to anxiety,
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.160]   it's just going to pump jet fuel into that anxiety.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.640]   And to what end? You are not on the front line.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.560]   Most of you setting policy for COVID.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   You were not on the front line trying to get bills passed in Congress.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.520]   You were not on the front line of the wildfire trying to get those fires put out.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.440]   We probably need to take a bit of a breather from this period we're coming out of,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   of incredibly intense news.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.960]   So go to extremely minimal news consumption.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.480]   And that's what I would recommend.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.800]   What that means can be different for different people.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.080]   I get a print version of the Washington Post. I glance at it most days.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.480]   That's basically my news.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.480]   And then my readers or listeners will send me articles that are relevant to
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.680]   specific things I write or think about. And that's interesting. And that's cool.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.920]   Like, Hey, look at this interesting study that came out about Facebook or
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.000]   something like that. But I'm very, very much out of the news right now.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.800]   And it's been great for me. I feel a lot better.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.720]   And so this is a good excuse to give that advice to everyone else.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.120]   We need to take a breather from news. And again,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.880]   the world will be okay temporarily without us being completely up to speed.
