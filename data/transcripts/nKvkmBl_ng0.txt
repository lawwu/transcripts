[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   Psalm 51 is a psalm of repentance from David after his adultery with Bathsheba
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.680]   and the murder of Uriah. The adultery is not mentioned in the psalm at all, and
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.320]   of course the question is, "Well, why not?" And what follows is a clip from John
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.240]   Piper's sermon, "A Broken and Contrite Heart God Will Not Despise," from his June
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.800]   8, 2008 sermon. Here's what he said. "There is not a word about sex in this psalm,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:43.160]   nor is there a word about murder, nor is there a word about lying. And it all
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:56.340]   started with sex, or did it?" No. Freud may think everything start with sex. "All my
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.140]   problems are sex." The Bible doesn't see it that way. The misuse of the beautiful
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.200]   gift of sex is a symptom of a disease, not the disease. And that's why this
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.820]   psalm doesn't mention it. And it's the main issue. Or we thought it was the main
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.160]   issue. It's not the main issue. This is the main issue. "Restore to me the joy of
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.680]   your salvation, because when that joy fades, I click on pornography. When that
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.040]   joy fades, I start cruising the neighborhood. When that joy fades, I get
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.600]   an itch for another woman. When that joy fades, on and on and on. Every sin on the
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.400]   outside is symptomatic of the absence of this joy. This psalmist knows how to
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.320]   fight." I don't have any problem doing all kinds of things to surround men and
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.400]   women with protections against sexual sin. In fact, I think that's a very good
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.200]   idea, just not the main point. If that's where you fight the battle
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.680]   continually, you will never get to the root of the issue. The root of the issue
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:18.640]   here is this renewed heart, this joy and gladness, the bones that God has broken
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.000]   healed with the joy of our salvation. He asked God to bring his joy to the
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.360]   overflow of praise. Verse 15, "O Lord, open my lips and my mouth will declare your
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:41.480]   praise." Praise is what joy in God does unless there's an obstacle that needs to
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.520]   be removed. And all of you have obstacles. Me too. And what he's praying is that
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:58.800]   they be removed. "Open my lips! Come on, mouth! Get with the soul! Why do I know
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.880]   him? Why do I love him? And I can't say it to my wife, I can't say it to
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.280]   my kids, I can sing in the congregation, but I can't praise him." Why? What's wrong
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.360]   with us? All kinds of obstacles. So join him, just join him in praying. "Open my
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   lips that I may praise you." He asks that the upshot of all this will be effective
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:38.960]   evangelism. Verse 13, "Then I will teach transgressors your ways and sinners will
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.800]   return to you." David is not content to be forgiven. He's not content to be clean.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:55.640]   He's not content to be elect. He's not content to have a right spirit. He's not
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:05.120]   content to be happy by himself. He will not be content until his brokenness
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:14.800]   heals others. So many of us think, "I've got to be totally triumphant to have a
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:23.640]   witness!" This makes no sense, if that's true. He has passed through incredible
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.000]   darkness and horrors morally in his life, and now he's saying, "If you could
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.240]   just give me a taste again of some of the joy that I once knew, all of this
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:42.880]   would result in conversions!" And it will. You think you have so blown it in your life,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.480]   you cannot be used. That's what many of you think in this room. You have so blown
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.080]   it that you cannot be used to make a difference for Jesus in the world. That's
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.600]   the devil talking. He doesn't want you to make a difference, that's for sure. And
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.240]   one of the reasons he helped drag you down was so that you'd think that way,
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.440]   and one of the reasons this is in the Bible is to nullify that lie. So just
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:19.080]   join David in pleading, "God, I know I've messed up. Oh, I've messed up! I've killed
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.160]   and I've raped and my baby's dead! Would you cause people to come to Christ
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.760]   through my life? Maybe that would be the way the Lord would make evangelism
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.240]   happen at Bethlehem." Amen. What a surprise to see missions appear in verse 13 of
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.240]   Psalm 51. For the full message, go to DesiringGod.org and search in John
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.400]   Piper's sermon archive for the title, "A Broken and Contrite Heart God Will Not
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.920]   Despise," the sermon preached on June 8, 2008. So what counsel would John Piper
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.160]   offer to a wife who's stressed and disappointed in her husband and who is
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.360]   considering divorce as a way of escape? We'll ask him that very question
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.720]   tomorrow. I'm your host Tony Reinke, thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.160]   podcast.
