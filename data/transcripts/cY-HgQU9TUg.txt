[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   I don't want to get people too scared, though, right, I, you know, you could listen to this
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.040]   and say, Oh, my gosh, my kids are going to get abducted, people are going to find me,
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.280]   they're going to see everything in my house. What message do you have to people that are
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.640]   maybe will help them get out of that feeling of leaving this thinking, everything's coming
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.360]   to an end, I should turn off all my technology and never leave the home?
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.160]   Well, interestingly enough, I've had someone say, Well, thank you, Adam, now that I've
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.600]   listened to you, you speak, I'm going home, I'm going to disconnect everything, I'm going
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.960]   to burn off my fingerprints, and I'm going to hide under my mattress. I said, But you
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.280]   can't do that. I mean, unless you're living under a bottle cap at the bottom of Loon Lake,
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.720]   and you're completely off the grid, which nobody is, you're out there. So the question
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:57.920]   is just be alert, know what the threats are, know what the red flags are. And and then
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.800]   practice, for example, the three M's do everything you can to minimize your risk of exposure.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.640]   Like for example, when you get a new Internet of Things device, which most things are these
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:20.840]   days, change the password. Most of them come with manufactured default passwords, and probably
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.800]   98% of those passwords are for sale on the dark web. So change the password to something
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.960]   long and strong. Just read the manual will tell you how to do it. Just like when you
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.920]   you know, get your router in, make sure that the password is what you want it to be not
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.320]   what someone else wants it to be. And make it as complex as possible, or use a password
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.320]   manager to help you with the whole thing. It's really all about two things that people
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.400]   have to understand. Number one, we all have day jobs. We work, we raise families, we're
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.840]   involved in educational activities, philanthropic activities, we own companies, we're busy.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:14.760]   That keeps us excited, interested, but also diverted. And to a hacker who's not diverted,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.720]   we are their day job. This is what they do. And you know, some countries they come in
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.920]   at eight, they have their lunch break, they go home at 430 or five o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.000]   And it's a job and they're working for the government. That's how they raise money. That's
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.460]   how they conduct espionage. Others work around the clock and do what they do, but it is their
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.160]   day job. And the second thing to understand is, when you look in the mirror, you see you
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.080]   and you go, why would anyone in the world want to steal my identity? Why would anyone
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.200]   care? And the answer is simple. You see you, but when they see you, a hacker, a scammer,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.160]   an identity thief, they see Jay-Z, Beyonce, Adam Levine. They see somebody who's got something
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   they want that can enrich their lives. Or, and this is not to offend anyone, it's not
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.400]   you thereafter, but it's your spouse, your child, your parent, an organization that you're
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.160]   involved with, a company that you work for, and you are simply the conduit to get them
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.680]   to whoever or wherever they want to get to.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.080]   So this is why it's extremely important that you really focus on cyber hygiene, just like
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.360]   you go to doctors, you go to dentists, you do things that you do to stay healthy. You
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.240]   have to maintain a healthy cyber environment because you're protecting yourself, your family,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.960]   possibly your company, your coworkers, and millions of innocent consumers that may be
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.500]   doing business with your company.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.960]   There was a concept that was raised a couple of years ago by the CEO of Microsoft, and
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   I think he was dead right, it's called shared responsibility. It's that we know that business
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.540]   hasn't done enough, we know that government hasn't done enough, and we know consumers
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.040]   haven't done enough to protect each and every one of us from the ravages of cyber issues
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.080]   or identity theft or ransomware. And each of us has a role to play. And with consumers,
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.460]   we didn't ask for it, we're not trained for it, and it's certainly not something we want,
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.800]   but it's a reality of where we are, what we do, who we are, and the world we live in.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.040]   And therefore, you know, it's incumbent upon each and every one of us to do our part because
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.620]   we could be protecting a whole lot more people than just ourselves by doing the right thing
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.240]   when it comes to cyber security. But it's not something that you need to be terrified
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.720]   of because it's reality, you're not going to escape it. So as a result, it's a question
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.800]   of just like they say with COVID, we got to live with it. So when it comes to cyber security,
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   we have to live with it. It is not an individual sport, it is a group sport, it's team. And
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.280]   in addition to which, you can't take a victory lap for cyber security because you could be
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.560]   completely secure at nine o'clock in the morning, and suddenly exposed at 901 because somebody
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.940]   clicked the wrong link, opened the wrong attachment, gave the wrong information to somebody. So
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.640]   if we kind of stick together, work with each other, collaborate, communicate, cooperate,
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.040]   we're going to be better off for it. And I think there's a much more collegial attitude
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.480]   now that it comes to cyber security than ever before.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.040]   And like you said earlier, with all the information out there, it's only a matter of time before
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.080]   someone decides to pick you as a target.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.760]   That's right. You win the lottery, the one you didn't even enter.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   But I'd say if you can make yourself a harder target by doing a lot of the stuff we talked
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.320]   about today, then you just move yourself further and further down that list where someone says,
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.920]   "Ah, this person's information isn't very easy to find online. Let's just skip to the
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.080]   next person where their address takes me a second to find."
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.160]   It's like the whole issue, if you're a burglar, do you break into the house where there's
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.560]   no dog or one where there is a dog where you might not be sure that you're going to come
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:27.480]   out with both legs? So it's important to do that. And a very important rule of thumb,
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:36.000]   anytime that anybody contacts you about anything and asks you to authenticate yourself for
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.680]   any reason, however plausible or logical it is, hang up.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.840]   It's one thing if you contact them and they're an organization trying to do the right thing
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.880]   and they're asking you to authenticate yourself, but if they contact you, no good.
