[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.080]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.040]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.040]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.680]   I am your host, and today on the show I want to talk with you about money mindset.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.120]   Or at least I want to begin talking with you about money mindset, or a different mindset
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.440]   about money.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:33.320]   These words, mindset, money, money mindset, these words are words that I hear, not uncommonly,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.640]   in financial circles, but they are some words that I didn't use to understand.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.440]   They're words that didn't use to compute with me or mean anything to me.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.540]   I would hear people talk about having a certain money mindset, but I just didn't have a way
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.680]   to articulate it.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.960]   I didn't deny the existence of some kind of way of thinking about money that makes a difference,
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.800]   but I didn't have a way to talk about it.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.560]   However, over the last couple of years, I feel like I've personally gained a lot more
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.760]   clarity on this subject, to the point where I look at myself and I realize that I have
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.520]   a different mindset around money than I once had, and how I like my current mindset better
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.520]   than I like my old mindset.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.760]   I also recognize, as I talk to lots of people about money, I recognize how differently people
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.640]   think about money, and yet how these differences are not objectively true or objectively false.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.500]   It's not like there's something that, "Oh, this is an ironclad law of the universe that
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200]   things work this way."
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.880]   It's just that people have different mindsets with regard to money, different mindsets as
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.900]   to how they want to live their life.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.080]   And so I can't, in today's show, articulate everything that I now see.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.860]   I want to begin the process of articulating some of the things that I do see, in hopes
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.360]   that this will be some ideas that will help you with your own mindset, to consider it,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.120]   to think about it, to test it, see if you like it and you want to keep it, or see if
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.680]   you don't like it and you want to discard it.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.600]   And today we're going to begin with one simple saying that I made up.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.760]   No one told it to me.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.280]   It's original with me.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   But I like it so much that I want to share it with you, and I want you to feel free to
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   take it and use it.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.440]   Feel free to steal it, because I think this is something really powerful about it.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.280]   The statement is simply this.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.840]   It's a statement of identity.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   Very very simple.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   Just a few words.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.120]   Here's the statement.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.520]   I make dreams come true.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.240]   I make dreams come true.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.800]   I make dreams come true.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.320]   This is a statement that I thought of first some months ago, and as I was thinking about
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.040]   I realized, this is me.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.080]   This is what I do.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.240]   And I applied it on a very personal level.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.360]   We could add some pronouns, right?
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.040]   We could say, I make my dreams come true.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   I think that's appropriate.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   I want to talk about that.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.760]   I make my dreams come true.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.800]   But I have thought about it a lot in terms of the people in my life, right?
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   I make my wife's dreams come true.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.760]   I make my children's dreams come true.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.640]   I make my siblings' dreams come true.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.480]   I make my parents' dreams come true.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.400]   I make dreams come true.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.040]   And then I expanded out to that.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.960]   I make my neighbors' dreams come true.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.680]   I make my clients' dreams come true.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   I make my listeners' dreams come true.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.000]   And for me, this has become an extremely powerful form of my identity.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.120]   And it's given me a different mindset about money than I once had.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.920]   If I were to articulate in just a few words some of the things that I once thought about
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.000]   money, I would say that—well, I hate to actually use these words because they're quite
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.280]   trite and overused—I would say that in the past, I operated from a scarcity mentality,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.040]   from the perspective that there's only so much money around, right?
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.920]   There's only so many—there's only a certain amount, and you've got to make sure you're
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.160]   careful with it.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160]   And I don't discard that entirely, right?
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.960]   I believe in being careful with money.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.840]   There's a different mindset if you think of money as being a scarce resource that has
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.960]   to be held onto and guarded versus money being a tool that is available to you in abundance.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.640]   And what has helped me to identify how I want to use money is that, for me, I want money
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.840]   to be used to make dreams come true.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.880]   As I record this podcast episode, I am sitting in my family's hotel room in the beautiful
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.680]   country of Mexico.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.160]   We've just begun a fairly—I don't know exactly how long this trip is going to go.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.840]   Let's call it a short to medium to long-term trip.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.920]   And I don't know how far this trip is going to take us, but I've loaded up, you know,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.200]   my wife, we have our four children, and we've gotten on airplanes, we've discarded all of
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.720]   our stuff, gotten down to suitcases again, and we're hitting the road.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.720]   And we're planning to travel for some time.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.200]   The exact details are still a little bit fuzzy because of the challenges of traveling during
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.760]   a global pandemic and all of the border closings and all of the administrative challenges due
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.360]   to that.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.020]   But right now we're hitting the road.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.500]   And part of that comes directly out of this concept of identity.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.320]   Am I the kind of person who sits back and who waits and who hopes that someday I might
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.160]   be able to make a dream come true?
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.320]   Or am I the kind of person who makes dreams come true?
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:50.860]   The reality is I make dreams come true.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.720]   I make dreams come true.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.660]   And this is becoming more and more a core component of my personal identity.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.220]   And it gives me something that I find very useful as a metric to which I can hold something
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.220]   up.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.220]   Right?
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:16.060]   Is there somebody that I can help make a dream come true?
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.060]   Here's somebody in need.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.180]   Can I make their dream come true?
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.020]   Can I help friends and family members who have unfulfilled dreams?
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.460]   Is there anything I can do to make dreams come true for them?
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.700]   Because I make dreams come true.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.660]   Now I'll share more in future episodes about our travels.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.960]   I'll share a lot as we go actually.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.980]   When we traveled before I didn't share a lot publicly.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.260]   But I'll share about the hard times and the good times.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.020]   Because one of the things that I like to do is I like to test things.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.820]   I like to test things for myself.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.940]   And it's part of – but I also like to test them for you and learn along the way.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.960]   Because I've done so much financial coaching over the years that I've learned that we
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:04.140]   really have just as human beings we really more or less share probably about 80% of our
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.500]   dreams commonly.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.580]   Meaning that you'll have your own 20% that are unique to you.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.020]   I don't have any interest in painting world class portraits.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   But somebody does.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.620]   I don't have any interest in racing motorcycles.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.980]   But somebody does.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.800]   But more or less many of our dreams they're similar to each other in about 80% of them.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.100]   And so I want to be one who makes dreams come true for you.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.540]   I want to be one who shows you the way to do things.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.020]   I want to be one who tests things and says, "Here's how you can do it.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.220]   Here's how you can do this quickly.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.140]   Here's how you can achieve this rapidly."
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.860]   Because I've learned so much that if you identify yourself as a person who takes action,
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.060]   as a person who doesn't just sit around and wait for your dreams, you can achieve
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.920]   dreams much faster than many people think possible.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.900]   This has actually become more and more part of my own personal identity.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.900]   I've realized I make dreams come true.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.540]   Which means that I can have a client who can come to me and say, "Joshua, here's my
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.540]   dream."
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.500]   And I can work out very quickly ways for that dream to come true quickly.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   And so you don't need to wait 30 years.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   You can do it now.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.500]   You can do it in two years.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.740]   You can do it in five years, 10 years.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.620]   I make dreams come true.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:18.140]   And so I want to walk you through that statement with a little bit of change of emphasis so
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:26.180]   that you can understand how that simple statement can give you a track to run on if you like
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.540]   it.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:34.280]   Because when you adjust your emphasis, you often get different aspects of truth.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.860]   Let's begin at the beginning.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.500]   I make dreams come true.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.700]   I make dreams come true.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.020]   I am that man who makes dreams come true.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.500]   That's me.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.500]   The one who makes dreams come true?
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.500]   Yep, that's me.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.140]   I do it.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.980]   I do it.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:58.460]   And I think a lot of times this really is the beginning of personal growth.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:04.220]   If you read a dozen or so self-development, personal development books, at least half
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:11.180]   of them will talk about how the starting point of personal success is personal responsibility,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.660]   where you take responsibility for your life and you stop expecting anything from anyone
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.780]   else.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:22.700]   You stand up and say, "I am in charge of me."
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.800]   And the day that you take personal responsibility for your life, complete and total 100% responsibility
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:35.340]   for your life and for everything in it can be a day in which everything changes.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:45.540]   And for me, I make dreams come true puts the pressure in the right place.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.580]   I'm the one who makes dreams come true.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.420]   Because if I'm the one who makes dreams come true, then I'm the one who can start to think
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:58.580]   about the process of how I might go about it.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.880]   I think any one of us who is perhaps older than 15 years old would recognize that there
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.940]   are always things that will happen outside of our control.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:14.920]   There are things and situations that the world throws at us that we did not choose.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:24.200]   But even though we are not ultimately in control, we can still take responsibility for what
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.880]   we can control.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:35.160]   And I can be the man who makes dreams come true.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:42.240]   One of the trends in our day and age that really concerns me very deeply is the trend
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.560]   of disempowerment and victimization.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:54.240]   For some reason, it has become hip and cool to be a victim.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.400]   It's become a better way to be.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.840]   If you can be somebody who is victimized, if you can be somebody who is oppressed, it
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.600]   gains you social credit.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.400]   And with your social credit now, you can enhance your circumstances.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.760]   The challenge is, when you start seeing yourself as an oppressed victim, it's really hard to
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.200]   change that perspective of yourself.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.880]   It's really hard to look at yourself as an oppressed victim and simultaneously see yourself
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.320]   as a powerful victor.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.440]   Those two things don't really go very well together.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.720]   And so pretty much in life, I'm convinced at this point that you kind of have to choose.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.960]   You have to choose the life that you're going to live.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.880]   Are you going to choose to be the person who is oppressed by your circumstances?
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.760]   Are you going to choose to be the person who is being victimized by those around you?
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.520]   Are you going to be the person who is a victim of the world at large?
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:04.720]   Or are you going to be the person who steps up and says, "I am responsible and I'm going
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.920]   to overcome this."
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.240]   Here's what I've observed about this particular line of thinking.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:17.400]   It doesn't actually matter whether it's true or whether it's not.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:27.280]   Meaning you could have a person who is genuinely a victim, who is an oppressed victim, and
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.720]   yet that person can study the mindset of victims and recognize, "That really doesn't serve
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   me.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.800]   It doesn't help me."
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.560]   And they can acknowledge freely, "I'm oppressed.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.440]   I'm a victim.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.920]   I'm persecuted."
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.880]   They can acknowledge that as absolutely true.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:54.360]   But if they will discard that and choose a different way of thinking, there's no guarantee
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:00.280]   that it'll help them to no longer be an oppressed victim, but there's a far higher likelihood
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:06.680]   that they'll be able to escape their oppression than if they didn't believe it.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.520]   And so when you think about your personal identity and how you see yourself, regardless
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:17.240]   of what the actual circumstances are, regardless of the actual truth, the actual veracity of
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:24.620]   whether you are powerful and in control or not, recognize that the mindset of somebody
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:33.240]   who chooses to take responsibility is going to have a higher probability of success than
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.520]   the mindset of somebody who doesn't, somebody who just sits back and waits for things to
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.600]   happen.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:49.800]   So in that tiny little word "I," there's actually a huge, huge amount of personal impact waiting
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.880]   to happen.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.320]   When you step up and you say, "I make dreams come true," and I encourage you even to start
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   with simply this, "I make my dreams come true.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.440]   I make my dreams come true."
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.560]   You step up and you say, "I make my dreams come true."
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.520]   It starts to fill you with a sense of clarity, a sense of purpose, and a sense of direction.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.640]   All right, well, if I'm the guy who's going to make my dreams come true, I got to actually
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.760]   step up and say, "It's time to make progress.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.760]   What do I do?"
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.000]   And I got to pull the problem apart, study it, start working on it, because I make my
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.240]   dreams come true.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   It's all on me.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.920]   If it's to be, it's up to me.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.880]   If it's to be, it's up to me.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.960]   I hope you find that useful.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.480]   I do.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:41.960]   I wholeheartedly concede that the world around gives me a set of circumstances that I can't
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.120]   control.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.600]   If it's to be, is it truly, ultimately, completely up to me?
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.440]   The answer is an obvious no.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.440]   No, it's not.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:02.040]   But the, "If it's to be, it's up to me," mindset, that puts me in a place where I can take responsibility
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.200]   for how I respond to the circumstances that are outside of my control, and it puts me
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.480]   in a place of growth.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.120]   I make dreams come true.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.880]   I make my dreams come true.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.680]   Next, I make dreams come true.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.880]   I make dreams come true.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.600]   I make dreams come true.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.680]   Make is an action verb.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.600]   It's a doing.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.960]   There's work involved.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.480]   There's effort.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:43.120]   If I make dreams come true, then the obvious question comes, "How?
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.120]   How?
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.120]   What?
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.120]   How?
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.120]   How?"
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.120]   Right?
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:53.480]   "I make," as a standalone sentence, doesn't make any sense.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.160]   It only makes sense to use the word "make" if there is an object.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.880]   I make what?
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.080]   I make where?
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.140]   I make how?
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.620]   There has to be some modification of that word "make."
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.400]   But the word "make" is a really good action verb.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:19.440]   And by focusing on action verbs, I'm teaching my brain to look for the things that can be
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   done.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.040]   Again, back to this victimization mindset.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.360]   A victim looks at the world and says, "I'm a victim.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.360]   I'm oppressed.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   I'm pushed down.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.840]   These circumstances that I'm in are just too difficult for me."
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.160]   And what happens is the brain accepts that as true.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.560]   The brain sits back and says, "You know what?
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.560]   It's true.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   You're right.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.560]   You're right."
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:48.360]   And all you start to see constantly is reasons why that's true.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.560]   I used to believe that people believe what they see.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.560]   I no longer do.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.480]   I now believe that we see what we believe.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.240]   I know this is sounding super frou-frou and fluffy.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   I get it.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.360]   I get it.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.680]   I'm convinced it's true.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.960]   That's why I'm saying it.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.240]   I hate sounding like a motivational speaker because I kind of feel there's so many motivational
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.720]   speakers that their words often are hollow.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.920]   But I'm convinced it's true, which is why I'm talking about it.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.840]   So forgive how it sounds.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.280]   I'm convinced it's true.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.100]   You'd weigh it and test it for yourself.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.080]   In life, we don't believe what we see.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.480]   We simply see what we believe.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:40.360]   We live our lives looking to see the movie that's in our head expressed in reality around
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.720]   us.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:49.280]   And the vast majority of the time, the reality that's expressed around us is exactly the
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.400]   movie that we saw in our head.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.360]   It's crazy.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.520]   It's crazy.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.400]   I think you could see this most obviously in politics.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.480]   As a longtime observer of politics, I've taken a great deal of interest in reading over the
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.080]   years people's political opinions.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.600]   Because people are so obvious and clear with their political opinions, you can see what
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.600]   they think.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.040]   And you'll see an event happen.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.560]   And if you keep lists of political people who disagree with each other, who see the
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.360]   world differently, you'll see the exact same event, the exact same facts, the exact same
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.880]   video, the exact same thing.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.040]   And two people will walk away with it with polarized opposite perspectives.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.440]   It's crazy.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.960]   It's absolutely crazy.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.260]   And you sit and you read them and you say, "Are they talking about the same event?"
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.000]   They're talking about the same event, the same video clip, the same speech, the same
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.320]   policy.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:48.480]   And yet they walk away with two exactly opposite perspectives on it.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.000]   Because they see what they believe.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.360]   They see what they believe.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:03.840]   So if that's true, then we need to be very careful about what we believe.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:14.200]   And if you believe that I make dreams come true, then what you constantly see is opportunities
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.960]   to make that truth.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.440]   If you believe I'm waiting for my dreams to come true, then what you constantly see
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.240]   is opportunities for you to sit and wait.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.080]   Now there's a fineness, a finesse, a texture to this.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.960]   All of my dreams have not yet come true.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   I am waiting on many parts of my dreams to come true.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.640]   And I'm sure you are too.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:50.920]   Because dreams don't come true just because you wish them to be true.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:57.320]   But if you see yourself as the person who makes dreams come true, then you see opportunities
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.280]   to be making your dreams come true.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.920]   Whereas if you see yourself as the person who waits for your dreams to come true, then
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.960]   you see opportunities for you to be the kind of person who waits for your dreams to come
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960]   true.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.800]   And I think that sucks myself.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.480]   I don't want to live that way.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:25.040]   So I choose to believe I make dreams come true.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:32.040]   Now you'll notice that I'm using either four or five words in this little statement.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.840]   I'm including a pronoun or sometimes I'm excluding the pronoun.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.520]   I make my dreams come true.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.200]   I make my wife's dreams come true.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.320]   I make my children's dreams come true.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.160]   I like to simply say to myself, I make dreams come true.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.080]   I'm the kind of person who makes dreams come true.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.000]   And the reason I do this is I believe that it opens my brain up.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.400]   It opens my mind up to see opportunities to make dreams come true for anybody that comes
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   across my path.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   And what I'm convinced, I'm still convinced 20 years later, ever since I first heard Zig
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.800]   Ziglar say it 20 years ago, that you can have everything in life that you want if you just
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.080]   help enough other people get what they want.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.700]   Or as I like to think about it, if you can love enough neighbors, you'll have plenty
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.480]   of love from your neighbors.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.280]   If you can help enough people, you'll have plenty of help from other people.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.160]   And so I love the way to think about this word, this amply.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:33.820]   I make dreams come true because by not restricting it to one particular pronoun, I make my dreams
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.400]   come true.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.080]   I can look at the world and say, are there any opportunities for me to make a dream come
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.140]   true today?
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.240]   And I'm convinced that practically on a daily basis, the answer is yes.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.240]   Yes.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.320]   I heard a story years ago.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.240]   I think it was about John Maxwell, but I'm not sure.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.360]   I think it was a friend of John Maxwell's was telling me they were doing some trip with
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.360]   him.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.160]   He did like some trip to Israel and they were on this trip with him and he had inserted
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.280]   something like a special thing.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.760]   I don't remember, like a special dinner, special event on that trip.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.080]   And it just blew them away about how thoughtful he was.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.260]   He had thought ahead and he had arranged this certain event.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.560]   And I thought to myself, I want to be that kind of guy.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:27.280]   I want to be the guy who we're all on a trip or we're going somewhere and here's the spontaneous
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.280]   surprise.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:35.420]   Here's the event, the special meal, the special touch, the special singer or piece of music.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.460]   It's just a special thing.
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.840]   I want to be the kind of guy who brings that kind of joy to the party.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:46.480]   And a lot of my life I've not been that kind of guy, but I want to be that kind of guy.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:52.520]   And I want to be the kind of guy who thinks about opportunities to make dreams come true.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:58.460]   Because a lot of times it's within my capacity to make a dream come true for someone if I'll
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:03.320]   simply pay attention.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.320]   Same for you.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.480]   All right, let me give an example.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:19.680]   I am sure that you personally engage in various kinds of charity.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.960]   Most people do, where they give money away to others expecting nothing in return.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:32.160]   A lot of times though, I think that we give money away in contexts where we don't get
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.920]   to experience the power of the gift.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:42.840]   An emergency happens across the world and we call up and make a donation to the Red
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:48.380]   Cross and they take your $300 and they put it in with the rest of the thousands and hundreds
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.480]   of thousands of dollars into their general fund and they do their job.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.320]   But it doesn't change somebody's life.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.280]   But take that same $300 and if you can give it a disaster, sure, I'm not saying don't
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.000]   do it, but think about how you could take that $300 and how you could make a dream come
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.640]   true for someone.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.520]   What if you gave that $300 donation to one person?
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.040]   Maybe there's a guy sleeping on the street in your neighborhood and you just went to
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:20.080]   him and you gave him $300 or $300 worth of help of some kind if you could find some way
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.880]   to help him.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:28.320]   What if you went to a struggling single mom that's in your church and instead of giving
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:35.160]   $300 to the Red Cross, you paid her rent this month or you sent her and her family on a
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.640]   vacation or something like that?
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.920]   The point is that life is full of opportunities and if we look through the lens of I make
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:50.480]   dreams come true, then it puts us in a place of looking around and saying, "What dream
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.120]   could I make come true for someone else?"
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.540]   And even at the small level, even at let's say the $300 level, are you going to change
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.000]   somebody's life with $300?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Probably not.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.520]   You're not going to solve the homeless guy living in your neighborhood.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.960]   You're not going to solve his problems with $300.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.520]   You're not going to solve the problem for a single mom with $300 if she doesn't have
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.520]   any money.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.640]   But what you can often do is you can make a dream come true.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.200]   You can take somebody on a helicopter ride.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.220]   You can take somebody to an event that they just would never spend the money on.
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.840]   Take them to a concert.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.760]   Take them to, I don't know, Disney World or something that makes sense to you.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.120]   I've always been fairly practical.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.120]   I used to look at people and I used to think, "Why would they spend the money on that?"
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.120]   Especially poor people.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.640]   I used to judge poor people a lot and say, "Why would so-and-so spend money on that?
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   That's dumb.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.680]   If they just saved their money, they could not be poor anymore."
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:52.720]   But along the way, I started to observe that when people spend money frivolously, it brings
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.980]   little sparks of joy into their life.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.880]   It brings little bits of light into their life.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.080]   And while I personally, I don't think that if I were in financial difficulty, I would
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.680]   choose to be frivolous with money, I would still want joy in my life.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.840]   And maybe there are times that I would.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:20.280]   To this day, I guess this is confessions of Joshua, I have never in my life bought a firework.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.120]   I've never spent a dollar on a firework.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.880]   I've always thought, "Why would I burn money up?
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.280]   It doesn't make sense to me.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.840]   I'll go to a firework presentation that someone else has done and sure, is there some of my
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.120]   tax dollar supporting it?"
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.120]   Maybe sometimes.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.880]   But I've never personally gone to a firework stand and purchased fireworks.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:42.120]   But I can't deny the joy that you can bring to your children's heart with some fireworks.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:47.520]   I think that in the coming years, I'll probably for the first time buy some fireworks or some
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.440]   version of those kinds of events.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.760]   I thought about that right now while I'm on this trip.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.760]   Why am I on this trip?
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.560]   Well, part of it is I make dreams come true.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.640]   I make dreams come true.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.200]   I'm the person who looks and says, "What dreams are out there?"
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.800]   And that means I'm going to pay attention to my dreams, my wife's dreams, my children's
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.640]   dreams and I'm going to look for opportunities to make them come true.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.200]   And I'm going to do this on a daily basis.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.920]   I'm going to say, "What would be something cool?
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.200]   What would be something special?
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.640]   How could I bring some joy to life?
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.680]   How can I bring some life to this party that's around me?"
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.920]   I don't much see what the point is of getting rich if you don't enjoy it.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.560]   Again, change of mindset, didn't used to see that.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.240]   But at this point in time, I honestly genuinely don't see what the point of getting rich is
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.520]   if you don't bring some joy to life.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.920]   I have a very hard time these days reading a lot of frugal blogs, reading people's stories
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:47.680]   and whatnot because a lot of what they say just doesn't resonate with me because it's
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.760]   not wrapped in the wrapper of a joyful life.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.040]   Now I respect people's ability to make their own decisions.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:01.520]   I respect each person's ability to choose what to do.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.400]   But I don't get it.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   I don't see what the point of it is.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.600]   I'll give you just an example from a friend of mine.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.360]   I have a friend of mine who lives near Orlando.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:20.080]   And each year, this particular friend, a couple of friends, they enjoy going sometimes, they
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.040]   have enjoyed going to the Gaylord Palms in Orlando to see the Christmas celebrations.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.200]   If you've never been to Gaylord Palms Resort, they're pretty spectacular.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   They're pretty amazing.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.640]   I still remember the first time I went to Gaylord Palms in Orlando and just it's pretty
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.200]   jaw-dropping to see.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   Beautiful.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.000]   Then inside the Gaylord Palms, I think there's one in Washington, I think, one in Tennessee,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.880]   one in Orlando and there may be one more.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:45.280]   But inside the Gaylord Palms, they have different scenes that are set up.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.960]   And they have this giant atrium with a glass roof and they have all the different animals
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.840]   and flora.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   And it's really incredible to see.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.500]   And then they decorate beautifully for Christmas.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.440]   And so my friends who went, they have a lot of money.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.640]   They're financially independent.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.840]   They have a lot of money.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   Now, they got there by being very careful with their expenses.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.300]   They're very frugal and they got there by being frugal with their expenses.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.080]   But they planned and they drove to Orlando to go and have lunch at the Gaylord Palms.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.960]   And they got to the parking lot and to park, I think it's $14 to park your car at the Gaylord
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.240]   Palms, regardless of how much time it is.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.400]   And they were so annoyed by the $14 fee that instead of going in and having lunch, they
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.440]   turned around and they left.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.200]   And when I heard the story, I just thought, "What is the point of being rich if you don't
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.600]   go to the Gaylord Palms for lunch to enjoy the Christmas decorations?
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.160]   And why would $14 be the point that turns you away?"
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:51.480]   Now, in defense, if I actually asked my friends directly, they would say, "Listen, Joshua,
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:57.440]   we like saving money and we're happier to save money than we are to squander it on $14
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.720]   of a parking fee.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.720]   And it's their money.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.720]   They're responsible.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.820]   They don't answer to me or to anybody and I respect them and their decisions.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.240]   But it doesn't make sense to me, me personally."
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:12.440]   Now, share it with you because perhaps you've done things like that, that you could have
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.200]   the nice thing, but you don't.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.120]   Why not?
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.600]   Why not?
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.680]   If you're financially independent, you're not going to all of a sudden go broke because
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.080]   you bought the $14 parking fee to go and enjoy the experience.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:34.640]   It's kind of similar in like the way I scratch my head sometimes with people who go to run-of-the-mill
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.800]   ordinary restaurants all the time.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.680]   And I think, "Why do you go to Chili's?"
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.680]   I actually like Chili's.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.680]   I'm a weirdo.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.880]   I don't go to Chili's or Friday's or these restaurants chains in the United States.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.480]   I enjoy Olive Garden breadsticks.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.480]   But there are a lot of people who go to those things constantly and I think, "Why not switch
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   it up?"
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   Right?
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.400]   Go this week, but the next week take a bottle of wine and a nice baguette to the park so
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.120]   that the following week you can go to the really great steakhouse.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.520]   Why not have the variety, the zest of life?
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.520]   We're not all the same.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.560]   People are different.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.120]   But look for the opportunities to make dreams come true.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.600]   Look for the opportunities to do things that are genuinely special.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.640]   Because if you don't do that, if you don't make dreams come true, then life just has
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   a certain sameness to it.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.000]   It's kind of the same old, same old, same old.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.160]   And this is easy, right?
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.280]   I have four young children.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:31.600]   It's challenging for me to say, to keep my life full of the kinds of experiences that
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.760]   I want to keep it full of.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.760]   It's challenging.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.760]   It's really tough.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.440]   I enjoy a Netflix and chill night just like anybody else does.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.000]   In fact, I probably enjoy it more than going to a theater.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:53.120]   But if life is not made up of moments with some spice, some moments that make you go,
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:59.680]   "This is nice," then there's this just boring sameness to it all, this humdrum existence.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.200]   And I don't think that's necessary.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.000]   You can do better and I think you should.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Make dreams come true.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.440]   I stole my thunder on the next one.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.520]   I make dreams come true.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.040]   Now a dream doesn't have to be a big thing.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.760]   I just started listening on this trip.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.520]   We've been driving with the children and I'm always looking for...
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.520]   I find it really hard to find good Spanish audio books for them.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.960]   And so I just started them off on Anne of Green Gables in Spanish, "Anna de las Tejas
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.960]   Verdes."
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.880]   I've read Anne of Green Gables when I was a kid and I enjoyed it.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.920]   But so I've been listening to it yesterday in the car while driving across Mexico with
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.680]   my family.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:48.640]   And I was listening to it and I was just thinking about, I love that protagonist's view of life.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:54.960]   She's just got this zest for living, this desire to take full advantage of everything.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:00.620]   And the things that she is dreaming of are profoundly simple.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:05.160]   And yet in the story, they're meaningful to her.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.620]   And I think a lot of times we're scared to talk about dreams.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:14.440]   We're scared to talk about dreams because somehow we unconsciously assign multimillion
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.480]   dollar price tags to dreams.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.640]   And yet you don't have to do that.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.960]   I make dreams come true.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.880]   The first step of making a dream come true is to identify what the dream is.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.240]   And a lot of times these are very simple.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.760]   I'll share one of mine.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.040]   It's no secret.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:45.400]   I spent a lot of my life living a very structured existence, getting up, very, very busy, packed
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   schedule, et cetera.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.240]   A number of years ago, I just realized one of my dreams...
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.480]   Why did I want to be financially independent?
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.240]   Why do I want to be financially independent?
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.000]   Because I don't want to have an alarm clock.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.360]   Realized one of my dreams is to live a life where I don't have to have an alarm clock.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.440]   Now you can take that in two ways.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.400]   You can say, "Well, I got to have $10 million in the bank so I don't have to get up in the
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.400]   morning."
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.480]   Or you can just adjust your life in some way that you don't need an alarm clock.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.760]   And I personally find living more or less without an alarm clock...
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.400]   Of course, I have a phone like everyone else that I have to catch a flight.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.160]   I set an alarm clock.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:29.760]   But I enjoy very much the existence of living without answering to an alarm clock.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.600]   I've made my dream come true.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:38.840]   And when you sit back and you start thinking about dreams, you have to begin with a list.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:45.640]   If you say, "I make dreams come true," in addition to whose dreams, which we just talked
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:51.920]   about, what are those dreams?
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   What are they?
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.720]   And you start to pay attention.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:59.160]   Now it would be nice if we could all have a list of all the dreams and write them down,
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.880]   but the reality is none of us are that structured in life.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.040]   But by actually paying attention and realizing, "You know what?
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.600]   This is a dream of mine," then you can identify something that you want and you can pay attention
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.760]   to it.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.400]   And so much of the time, we don't pay attention to the things that we want and thus we have
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:21.320]   no clarity on where we want to go, no clear idea of what we want to do or why.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.160]   And with that lack of clarity, we move through life without any sense of direction, without
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.800]   any sense of certainty.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.200]   We live out the dreams that other people have handed to us.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.920]   The society has said that this is what you should do, and we don't go with it.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.320]   Give you an example, okay?
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.040]   Very simple example.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.800]   I may at some point in the future own a house again.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.360]   I'm not opposed to owning a house.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.280]   But my dream is not to own a house.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   That's not me.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.600]   I don't want to just have a big, beautiful house and be there all the time and whatnot.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.280]   I have people that I love very much.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.280]   That is their dream.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   And so by just simply recognizing that's not my dream, you can give yourself permission
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:12.880]   to imagine a whole different lifestyle and recognize that we don't all have to live the
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.440]   same lifestyle.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.440]   Maybe this is.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.760]   I don't know maybe about it.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.920]   This is a very millennial type of thing.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:27.640]   But I remember the day when I ticked the last box on life's list.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.600]   I ticked that last box, right?
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.800]   I graduated from high school.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   I went to college.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   I graduated from college.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.240]   I got a job.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   I got married.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   I got a dog.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.520]   And the last box, I bought a house.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.240]   And the last box that I ticked was have a baby.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:47.120]   I remember when I bought my wife and I had our first child and I just thought, "I'm done.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.720]   I've done it.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.720]   I'm done."
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.360]   I never worried about, "Oh, you're going to have a college fund."
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.360]   I'm done.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.800]   I ticked all the boxes.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:02.320]   Now I've experienced what this is like and I can consciously choose to enjoy these things
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   or I can consciously choose to make different decisions in life.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   Got rid of my job.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.080]   Got rid of my house.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.120]   Not going to get rid of my dogs, my kids, or my wife, but I'm willing to think about
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.200]   a different lifestyles than most people do.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   And I love it.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.760]   It's exciting.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.000]   Why?
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.040]   Because I've become more attuned to what my personal dreams are.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:32.400]   Now I'm trying to pay a lot of attention also to what are the dreams of those around me.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.880]   I've become a much better listener over the last years.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.400]   What are my wife's dreams?
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.400]   What are my children's dreams?
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.720]   What are my parents' dreams?
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.360]   Because if I make dreams come true, I'm the kind of person who has to listen for what
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:50.000]   those are and look for opportunities to bring some spice to life.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.320]   Not always been very good at it, but I want to be good at it.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:38:03.440]   I want to get better because I want to be the kind of person who makes dreams come true.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:10.200]   I make dreams come true.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.240]   In order to make a dream come true, you have to follow through.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.380]   You have to actually do it.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.920]   I make dreams come true.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.840]   Not just in my head, not just imagining them.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:29.720]   I actually make them come true.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.880]   We come back again to that point of action, that point of commitment, that point of actually
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   doing something.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:41.800]   I'll give you an example from my own set of dreams.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:47.760]   Later this year, I personally hope to, that's the idea again, administrative challenges,
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:53.520]   but later this summer and this fall, I hope to be in Israel.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:39:00.440]   The reason that I hope to be there is because a number of years ago I went to Egypt.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   When I was in Egypt, my entire perspective of the history of the human race completely
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.240]   changed.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:15.400]   To put it in just a few words, growing up in the West, you basically have this idea,
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.880]   this archetype that's instilled upon you, it's imprinted on your brain, that things
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:28.240]   throughout the world have come from a place of crude beast, let me be careful with that
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:36.680]   word, crude beastliness, a place of crude, rough beginnings, no culture, no anything,
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.640]   to our current age where we are the most advanced creatures who've ever walked the planet.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:49.160]   This is certainly common in the evolutionary paradigm in which so much of our world swims.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   The idea that there was a point in time where there was chaos and disorder, and yet through
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:00.480]   the power of a biological evolutionary process, things are just getting better and better
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.600]   and better all the time, more and more sophisticated and better and better.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.840]   But yet it goes deeper than that.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.560]   It's not just a biological argument that people make.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.540]   It's just more of the societal argument.
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.560]   You see this happen right now in our society where people say, "Well, we're more enlightened.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.320]   We understand more about life.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.600]   We understand the world.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.800]   We're enlightened, much more enlightened than our forebears.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:26.640]   How could so-and-so have believed these beastly concepts, these crude and rough concepts?
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.160]   Today we know what the verdict of history is going to be, and so we're going to be on
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.080]   the right side of history going forward."
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.640]   That's the basic, I would say, mindset that infuses our culture.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.240]   This is especially powerful in the United States of America because US Americans generally
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:45.400]   see themselves as superior to virtually every country in the world on virtually every metric,
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.520]   and it's just accepted as a matter of faith.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.520]   That's the way it is.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.520]   Of course it's the way it is.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.440]   After all, this is the United States of America.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.000]   I remember the first time I went to ... I've only been to Egypt one time so far.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.600]   I went to Egypt, and I started walking through ... The pyramids were ... I don't know.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.080]   It was neat to see them, but they didn't impress me all that much.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.840]   What impressed me was the temples.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:15.680]   Egypt is so full of these temples, and you walk through some of these ... I think it's
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:23.880]   Luxor and Aswan, and you look at these temples and you think, "This is amazing."
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:29.520]   I read my Bible a lot over the years, but I was reading when I was there in Egypt through
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:33.600]   Genesis and all of a sudden the world looked totally different, and I realized I could
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.440]   never go back.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.940]   If you read the Bible and it talks about Joseph being put a second in command under the pharaoh,
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.720]   you think, "Oh, Joseph was this little guy out here.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.680]   He had ... It says he had granaries full of grain to save the children of Israel from
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   the famine.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   Maybe he had a barn or two."
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.720]   No.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.580]   This was a stunning culture.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:42:02.120]   The sophistication, the cultural sophistication of the Egyptian people of that day was absolutely
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   breathtaking.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.040]   I realized I'd like to see this better.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.040]   I want to go to Petra.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.040]   I want to go to Jordan.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.040]   I want to go to Israel.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:15.000]   I want to understand these ancient cultures, because this concept that somehow was imprinted
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.080]   upon me was completely wrong.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:25.000]   The problem is that although I said it, I spent several years just sitting there.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.200]   It's like, "Okay, I'd like to do it someday.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.800]   I'd like to do it someday, but that's not a good time.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.840]   We're having a baby.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.440]   It's expensive to go to Israel, et cetera."
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.960]   I'm like, "No, I really want to do it.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   I want to go to Israel.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   I want to go to Jordan.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.200]   I want to go back to Egypt.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.360]   I want to see it for myself."
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:44.700]   Finally, at some point in time, I realized, "Listen, Joshua, if you're the kind of guy
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.960]   who makes dreams come true, you got to actually make them come true, which means you make
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.720]   the decision.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:56.040]   You pull out the credit card and you put the numbers in and you buy a plane ticket.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.200]   You make a hotel reservation.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.880]   You sign on the dotted line.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.220]   You pull the trigger.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:10.720]   You insert your favorite metaphor, but action is necessary to make dreams come true.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.520]   But action only proceeds from a clearer vision of who you are.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.680]   It only proceeds from your mindset.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   If I'm the kind of person who has dreams, then I'm the kind of person who can look at
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.360]   life and say, "I've got dreams.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   I've got goals.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.360]   I've got plans.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.360]   I've got things I'd like to do.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.080]   I've got dreams.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.320]   Who doesn't?"
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:45.000]   But if I'm the kind of person who makes dreams come true, it changes the world and it makes
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.260]   you realize that, "All right, Joshua, you want to go to Israel.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.560]   You've said for three years you want to go to Israel.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.560]   You've written it down.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.720]   I'd like to go to Israel, but it's just never been convenient."
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.320]   Are you the kind of person who makes dreams come true or are you the kind of person who
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.280]   just, "Maybe I didn't actually want to go to Israel."
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.480]   It's actually not that hard to go to Israel.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.040]   It's hard in a pandemic, of course, with closed borders, but it shouldn't be very hard pretty
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.040]   soon.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.680]   You buy a plane ticket.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   You go.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:22.400]   Hire a tour guide, tour around, and you go and do it.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:28.880]   And almost any dream is actually about that simple.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.000]   Notice I said simple, not easy.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.960]   Almost any dream is about that simple.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.120]   Many times we have dreams that are hard.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.120]   Hard is okay.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.520]   I like Cliff Gravenscraft's thing, "I don't need easy.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.520]   I just need worth it."
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.680]   It's his favorite saying.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.680]   I love that saying.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.680]   It's great.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.680]   "I don't need easy.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.680]   I just need worth it."
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.680]   It's hard to do easy.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.680]   I don't mind hard things.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.680]   Doing hard things is fun.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.400]   As human beings, we're wired to do hard things.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.200]   Why do people go out and run marathons?
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.480]   There's no reason for them to go run a marathon.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.520]   The car works a lot better.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:08.020]   The car gets them from point A to point B. A marathon is terrible for you.
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:13.720]   Running marathons is awful for you, but it's hard, and so psychologically it's good for
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.880]   you, because it's something hard.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.200]   We like doing hard things.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.640]   Why do we want to save a million dollars or earn $100,000 or get a college degree?
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.860]   We're not scared of these hard things.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.320]   Hard things make us feel alive.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.300]   They make us feel excited, enthusiastic about life.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:34.320]   Doing hard things is actually quite fun.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.320]   Just think about this.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.320]   Think about your friends.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.340]   Here's my tough mudder pictures.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:42.800]   Why are you in the freezing rain crawling under barbed wire through the mud?
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   Because it was fun.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.800]   Why was it fun?
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.800]   It was hard.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.720]   I didn't like it, and I wanted to do it.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.680]   The examples are endless.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.400]   People do hard things because they're fun.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.040]   It feels good to do something difficult.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.760]   It feels good to have a sense of accomplishment.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.840]   Yeah, I did that thing.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.120]   I hiked to the bottom of the Grand Canyon and back out.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.320]   I drove my motorcycle across the United States.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.440]   We hiked to the tip of Ushuaia.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:10.840]   Whatever it is, we did it.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:16.080]   It's fun to do hard things.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.760]   We don't need easy.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.000]   We just need worth it.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.360]   I'm not scared by a hard dream.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.680]   Hard dream is probably simple.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.800]   Take almost any hard thing that you have in life.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   I want to become a millionaire.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.360]   It's not that hard to become a millionaire.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.960]   It's a fairly simple process.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.640]   How much money do you earn?
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.300]   How much money do you spend?
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.120]   How much money do you invest, and at what rate of return?
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.120]   Do the math.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.840]   We'll tell you when to become a millionaire.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.640]   It's very simple.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.120]   It's not easy, but it's simple.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.320]   If your dream is to become a millionaire, there you go.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.360]   You can do it.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.800]   But once you count the cost, you actually have to sit down and say, "Okay, I'm making
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.800]   this much.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.240]   I probably need to make more.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.360]   I'm spending this much.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.520]   I probably need to spend less, and I'm investing at this amount.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.080]   I probably need to make a little more money on my investments."
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.320]   These things are simple, but they're doable, and you can achieve the dream.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.840]   But you have to see yourself as the kind of person who can do it and actually start doing
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.720]   it to make it come true.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:28.800]   If your dream is to go to Israel, you got to make it come true.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.320]   If your dream is to run a marathon, you got to make it come true.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.040]   If your dream is to get married, make it come true.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.040]   Whatever.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:41.040]   You got to make it come true.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:49.400]   If you have the right mindset, and by right, I mean a mindset that is useful to you, a
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.800]   mindset that serves you.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:57.640]   I'm not arguing here that there's a mindset that's objectively true and objectively wrong.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.340]   True and false, right and wrong.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.920]   By right, I mean you have a mindset that serves you as a person that helps you.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:11.680]   If you have the right mindset, all of a sudden, life becomes a lot simpler, a lot clearer.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.640]   I wish I could have understood that 15 years ago.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   I didn't.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:20.160]   But I feel like today I do.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:25.200]   And one component of that is this very simple statement.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:30.120]   I make dreams come true.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:34.760]   If you like my statement, I encourage you to say it to yourself,
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.640]   and really think about it.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.920]   I make dreams come true.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.920]   I make dreams come true.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.460]   I make dreams come true.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.600]   I make dreams come true.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.680]   I make dreams come true.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:59.280]   I make dreams come true.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.280]   I make dreams come true.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:07.440]   I make dreams come true.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.640]   I make my dreams come true.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.240]   I make my wife's dreams come true.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:17.280]   I make my children's dreams come true.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.040]   I make dreams come true.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:27.160]   I make dreams come true.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.320]   Not to-do lists.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.720]   I make dreams come true.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.080]   I make dreams come true.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:40.840]   I make dreams come true.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:46.560]   I make dreams come true.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:52.600]   I make dreams come true.
