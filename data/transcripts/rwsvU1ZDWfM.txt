[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.600]   - A very busy college student who happens to find time
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.600]   to listen to the podcast named William
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.520]   also found time to write us this question.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.360]   Pastor John, I'm an undergraduate student studying
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.940]   English, philosophy, ancient Greek, and Latin.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.120]   I hope to attend seminary and use my education
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.140]   to help others see the glory of Christ,
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.200]   but my Reformed roots are always pushing me
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.160]   to wanna do it by the book.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.760]   Although God's word is sufficient and inerrant,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.560]   it does not encompass all knowledge.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.880]   For example, we do not throw out the law of gravity
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.320]   just because Jesus never explained
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.480]   why apples fall from trees.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.600]   So how do you navigate what to keep and what to get rid of?
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.840]   Say, if Aristotle makes some points about epistemology
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.440]   that the Bible doesn't explicitly affirm,
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.040]   but also doesn't deny, is it okay for me to say it is true?
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.240]   Pastor John, what would you say to William?
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.800]   - The doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture,
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.480]   which he's alluding to in part,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.460]   is not designed to discourage us
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.560]   from gaining knowledge from the natural world.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.560]   That doesn't, knowledge that doesn't come through the Bible,
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.440]   it's just coming from observation.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.240]   It's not designed to discourage us
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.720]   from getting that kind of knowledge.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.760]   Rather, the doctrine is designed to protect us
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.200]   from seeking or receiving more supernatural knowledge,
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.440]   more supernatural revelation.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.420]   In other words, God's word to us in Scripture
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.200]   does not need to be supplemented by more words of God
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.400]   from anyone claiming to be God.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.360]   The point is that the Scriptures are sufficient revelation
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.040]   from God to accomplish what the revelation
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.040]   was designed to do and does not need to be supplemented
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.720]   by any more revelation.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.720]   So Jude, in his book near the end of the New Testament,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.520]   says, "I found it necessary to write appealing to you
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.700]   "to contend for the faith that was once for all
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.040]   "delivered to the saints."
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.040]   There is a finality about God's revelatory word
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.680]   through Jesus Christ and his apostles.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.100]   There is a once for all deposit of truth.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.400]   There's a completed whole counsel of God.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.720]   There's a faith once for all delivered.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.240]   And the doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   is meant to safeguard the completeness of that revelation.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.280]   It never was designed to prevent or discourage
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.000]   the use of our minds and our eyes and ears and hands
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.640]   to investigate God's world and discover how it works
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.640]   so that we can put it to best use for the good of mankind.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.640]   In fact, the Bible itself explicitly commands us
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.080]   to learn from other sources besides the Bible.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.600]   And the book of Proverbs is probably the best known
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.520]   for this, like this simple statement, Proverbs 6, 6,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.680]   "Go to the ant, O sluggard, consider her ways,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.880]   "consider her ways and be wise."
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.800]   In other words, get out there, find an anthill,
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.960]   and watch those critters and learn something
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.080]   about diligence in the summer, so you don't starve
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.000]   in the winter.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.680]   This is just a simple illustration of how the ant
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.120]   is an aspect of God's general revelation,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.020]   not special or supernatural revelation.
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.400]   By natural or general revelation,
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.520]   God shows us things we need to know to use the world
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.360]   the way he intended for it to be used.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.360]   When God said in Genesis 1:28, "Be fruitful, Adam and Eve,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.280]   "be fruitful and fill the earth,"
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.600]   multiply, fill the earth, "and subdue it, have dominion,"
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.480]   he knew that Adam and Eve would need to figure out
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.720]   the specifics of sexual intercourse.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.680]   Are you gonna multiply?
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.680]   Well, and he knew that in order to subdue
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.560]   and have dominion over nature,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.040]   they would need to observe the natural world,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.960]   draw inferences from it, formulate plans,
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   how to make the best use of it for the good of mankind.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.160]   Most of that knowledge will come from outside the Bible.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160]   Jesus, in fact, talks about people getting
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.000]   that knowledge.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.240]   If you're a sailor and you see that it's red
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.920]   in the morning, sailors warning.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.900]   If you see it's red at the night, sailors delight.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.900]   He told the Pharisees, "Look, you can judge the world well.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.980]   "Why don't you judge the spiritual world
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.620]   "as well as you do the external world?"
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.620]   So William's question then becomes, rightly,
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.820]   when you read Aristotle or any philosopher or historian
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.560]   or mathematician or scientist or novelist
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.760]   or theologian or politician, how, he says,
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   do you navigate what to keep and what to get rid of?
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.440]   And I think the best way I could answer that,
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.200]   even though it's a very complicated issue
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.960]   if you come at it from every angle,
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.260]   I think you can boil it down to a principle.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.480]   And the best way for me to get at that principle
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.160]   would be to quote the affirmation of faith
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.560]   that we produced at Bethlehem Baptist Church
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.880]   over the years that I was there
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.540]   and then Bethlehem College and Seminary
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.320]   is based on this affirmation of faith.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.080]   The church still is based on it.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.520]   Desiring God is based on it.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.080]   And here are the first two paragraphs, they're short,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.440]   of that affirmation of faith.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.840]   And the second one addresses William's question directly.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.760]   It goes like this.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.680]   We believe that the Bible,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.400]   consisting of the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments,
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.600]   is the infallible word of God,
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.040]   verbally inspired by God and without error
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.840]   in the original manuscripts.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.200]   Paragraph two.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   We believe that God's intentions revealed in the Bible
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.640]   are the supreme and final authority
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   in testing all claims about what is true and what is right
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.480]   in matters not addressed by the Bible.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   What is true and right is assessed by criteria
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.160]   consistent with the teachings of Scripture.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.520]   Let me say that last sentence again, 'cause that's it.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.800]   In matters not addressed by the Bible,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.080]   what is true and right,
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.560]   so you get the epistemological issues of truth
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.500]   and you get the ethical issues of what's right and wrong,
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.920]   those issues are assessed,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.760]   whether it's from Aristotle or whoever,
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.440]   assessed by criteria consistent
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.240]   with the teachings of Scripture.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   So the practical effect of such a principle
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.800]   is to say to William, as he studies English, philosophy,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.780]   ancient Greek, Latin, very busy guy,
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.060]   saturate your mind, this is for all of us now,
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.060]   he asked, saturate your mind with the wide and deep truth
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.860]   and wisdom of Scripture so that you are equipped
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.060]   at every level of encounter with knowledge
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.260]   to discern how the principles of Scripture
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.940]   and the truth of Scripture guide you
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.980]   in assessing what you are seeing.
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.400]   Keep yourself in a community of believers
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.600]   where other minds also, besides your own,
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.800]   provide guidance and ballast so that you're not alone
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.480]   in this process of assessment.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.920]   - So good.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   There is such a huge opportunity for Christians
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.480]   to do education with a conscious theology.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.320]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.080]   And thank you, William, for taking time
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.340]   to send in your question and for wrestling with this topic.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.040]   Well, the weekend is here and we're gonna break,
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.080]   but feel free to take some time to find out more

[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.080]   We are putting the finishing touches up
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.020]   on the 2016 Pastors Conference,
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.740]   which begins Monday here in Minneapolis downtown
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.740]   at the Convention Center.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.980]   As many of you know, conferences require a lot of prep
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.660]   and a lot of labor and a lot of last minute details
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.180]   and of course an army of volunteers to pull off.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.260]   And so we do covet your prayers for us.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.780]   And I'll have details on the conference next time.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.460]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.480]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.320]   with John Piper.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.380]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.540]   (upbeat music)
