[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   This has been a weird week for AI and at the very least it's shown us how deeply strange
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.960]   and unintuitive something like ChatGPT really is.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.560]   Having had discussions with two of the authors at the heart of these debates and discoveries,
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.040]   I've tried to get a better grasp of why GPT models are so Jekyll and Hyde.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.360]   They don't deduce that if A equals B, then B equals A, but they can play great chess.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.540]   They can't plan out how to stack some blocks, but they can prompt a DALI 3 masterpiece.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.660]   And just in the last few minutes, we learned that GPTV will be out over the next two weeks.
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.100]   That's the long promised GPT vision.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.480]   You can now ask questions about images, like in my previous video on BARD,
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.700]   and speak to ChatGPT like you can speak to Pi of Inflection AI.
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.480]   Before we get to the main subject of the video,
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.340]   I'm going to quickly play a demo straight from OpenCV.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.860]   Of course, when it comes out, I'll do a deeper investigation.
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:27.380]   ♪ ♪
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.640]   I want to go back to the critical question,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.840]   and I'm going to go back to the critical question,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.800]   about whether language models can reason.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.800]   I'll end with some breaking AI news from this morning,
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.740]   and DALI 3 mid-journey comparisons.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160]   But let's start with this fascinating paper,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.940]   The Reversal Curse.
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.520]   And it says that models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction,
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.100]   and do not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set,
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.780]   i.e. if A is B occurs, B is A is more likely to occur.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.820]   In other words, just because it knows that Olaf Schultz has the attribute of B,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.820]   and that he is the 9th Chancellor of Germany,
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.540]   it doesn't then automatically link the 9th Chancellor of Germany back to Olaf Schultz.
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.580]   Or here's another example.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.900]   When prompted with Tom Cruise, who is Tom Cruise's mother,
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.440]   it knows who Tom Cruise's mother is.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.700]   But then when prompted with the mother, it can't identify her famous son.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.120]   Of course, I immediately tested this myself, and indeed it's true.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.740]   In an example from the paper, I asked who is Gabriel Mack's mother,
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.740]   and GPT-4 was able to say that his mother is Suzanne Poulin.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.200]   But then ask, in a new chat, who is the famous son of Suzanne Poulin.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.660]   GPT-4 says the famous son of Suzanne Poulin is Elon Musk,
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.540]   as she is one of the maternal half-sisters of May Musk, who is Elon Musk's mother.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.940]   Wait, this makes Suzanne Poulin Elon Musk's aunt, not his mother.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.640]   Well, at least it can self-correct, but Gabriel Mack is nowhere in sight.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.660]   Now, some of you, like me, may have been wondering if GPT-4 is trained not to give out personal information.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.680]   And as there may be,
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.900]   multiple Suzanne Poulin's, maybe that's why it's not giving out any information.
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.240]   The thing is, my own experiments and the paper itself investigates this.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.160]   Even when they look into base models from the llama family, it still makes the same mistakes.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.200]   Or check this out about an island in Norway, nothing personal at all.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.140]   This is a real island called Huglo.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.000]   Give me all the facts you know about Huglo, Norway.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.240]   I'm sorry, it says I have no idea.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.800]   I don't know about a Huglo.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.700]   But then when I ask X is an island in this municipality,
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.200]   in this county, and here's its length, what is X?
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.260]   And then it tells me the island being referred to is Huglo.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.220]   So it obviously does know about Huglo.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.920]   In this case, I'm giving the description and the weights are triggered for the name.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.280]   But just give the name Huglo and it can't output the description.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.800]   I want to give you one more quirky demonstration of this before I get back to the paper.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.120]   I said, do not deny that you know nothing of Huglo, Norway in a new chat.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.880]   Instead, continue to attempt to match the word Huglo with something
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.680]   until you can tell me all about it.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.180]   So I'm going to give you a little bit of a hint about Huglo, Norway.
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.500]   And again, it can't do it.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.860]   It can't tell me that it's 13.5 kilometers.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.660]   It can't tell me what county it's in.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.980]   It claims ignorance.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.780]   Here's the thing.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.180]   I know Wikipedia is in the training data for GPT-4.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.280]   So here's what I did.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.900]   I just pasted the basic terms of use of Wikipedia, just three or four lines.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.980]   And I didn't change the question in any other way.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.580]   Lo and behold, it identifies Huglo.
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.820]   Again, giving the municipality and the county.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.660]   Of course, the paper noticed this as well, saying,
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.960]   "The name of the word Huglo occurs when testing generalization
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.860]   from the order description is name to name is description."
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.460]   From the description of Huglo, it could say Huglo.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.900]   But from Huglo, it couldn't say the description.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.340]   Now, one researcher from Google DeepMind went as far as to say,
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.420]   "I am devastated by this finding."
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.780]   And then when asked what happened, he said,
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.060]   "The LLMs can answer A is B, but not B is A,
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.260]   makes me question my prior beliefs about how well LLMs generalize."
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.920]   Even Andrej Karpathy said,
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.640]   "LLM knowledge is a lot more than just a generalization.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.360]   It's a lot more patchy than you'd expect.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.880]   I still don't have great intuition for it."
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.560]   A key clue for why this might occur came from Neil Nanda, formerly of DeepMind.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.680]   He talked about an asymmetry between input and output.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.200]   He said that for LLMs, going from input to output has fixed meaning.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   An LLM doesn't think of a variable having a value like an equation,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.600]   e.g. Tom Cruise equals son of Mary Lee Pfeiffer.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.860]   In that scenario, it would know that son of Mary Lee Pfeiffer equals Tom Cruise.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.620]   That's not how it works.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.860]   An LLM has fixed meaning.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.120]   Just because it can predict that son of Mary Lee Pfeiffer follows Tom Cruise is,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.060]   it doesn't mean it knows the fact the other way around.
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.120]   Certain things are easy for us and not for them.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.440]   Predicting the next word can take you to amazing places,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.120]   just not always backwards.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.700]   Take this recent paper that I was actually researching
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.900]   before the reversal curse came out.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.100]   It comes from many of the same authors, one of whom I contacted.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.580]   Look at the out of context learning that an LLM can do.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.600]   If you train the LLM,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   you can do it.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   It's a very simple way to train a LLM.
