[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.720]   ♪
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.700]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.200]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.900]   I have got a great show for you today.
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.880]   Today, I am going to teach you how to read a book.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.340]   Yes, I am going to teach you how to read a book.
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:00.420]   And this show, perhaps more than any show that I have done in almost 700 episodes of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.520]   this show could be your key to financial success.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.800]   This could be your key to financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.500]   When we think of that old aphorism, "Give a man a fish and you'll feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and he'll have food for a lifetime,"
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.880]   that applies best in this area more than anything, because I am going to teach you how to achieve your goals and solve your problems,
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.920]   even if you don't have somebody close to you to help you, somebody close to you to mentor you.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.520]   For the first five minutes, I am going to try to change your view of reading.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.800]   Between minutes 5 to 10, I am going to give you some ideas about books and reading that I think will fundamentally change how you read for the rest of your life.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.940]   And then towards the end of the show, I am going to talk to you and share with you how you can get a copy of my recommended reading list.
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.440]   So stay tuned for that towards the end.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.480]   We begin today with books.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.080]   Why books?
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.220]   Why are books important?
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:12.020]   I am going to give you a five-minute sales pitch here on books, because in the modern world, when so many of us know how to read,
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.620]   it seems that fewer and fewer of us are actually reading.
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.940]   And I myself, as a lifelong reader, have found it challenging to stay a lifelong reader in today's world.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.580]   You, I am sure, know how to decode the text of a book.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:38.680]   But man, books are not nearly as fun and as exciting as a really well-done YouTube video, as a really well-done social media session, right?
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   That stuff is so shiny and flashy, and it engages us.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.600]   It often feels difficult to sit down and read.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.300]   It feels boring to sit down and read, even to the best of us.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.920]   And yet it shouldn't feel that way.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:03.200]   It should not feel that way, because books are some of the most valuable tools to help you achieve what you want to achieve in your life.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.880]   And so they should be an absolute priority for us in our lives.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:18.240]   If you sit around and passively consume entertainment, be it in the form of beautifully well-done movies, beautifully well-done videos,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:26.720]   beautiful social media arguments all day long, wonderful, inspiring information, if you just simply sit around and absorb that,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.600]   you will spend your entire life as simply a consumer, and you will never start to make the progress in your life that you're hoping for.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   And you'll get fat and lazy and just consume, consume, consume, consume more, because it's so hard to gain wisdom in those ways.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.520]   Now, I'm not against using those tools.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.560]   They have a place.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.280]   The most recent show I did, I talked about the value of the multimedia, et cetera.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.080]   But books are so much more important for you to achieve your goals faster.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.800]   Books, here's why, five reasons.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.760]   Number one, books are the most synthesized information that you can possibly get.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.360]   Books are researched, they're edited, and they're pithy.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:15.600]   More time and effort goes into the writing of a book by an author than any other form of media.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.120]   Way more than a good video.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.400]   Way, way, way, way, way more than a good podcast.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.720]   Way more than anything else.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.400]   Books are researched.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.840]   That process takes at minimum months, usually years and frequently a lifetime.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.760]   Books are researched carefully.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:41.520]   They are wrestled over where an author says, "I only need to put the most important ideas in here, and how do I restate these ideas in the most impactful way?"
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:55.000]   Then they're carefully edited where all the extraneous fluff is pulled out, and you are left with a pithy, concentrated repository of information and ideas, all in the space of a few hundred pages.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Books are the most carefully researched and edited information that you can get.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.960]   Number two, books are timeless.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.680]   You can't go and listen to Ben Franklin's podcast, but you can read his words.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.000]   And by the way, there's a podcast idea for one of you.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.640]   Somebody should probably take all his books and turn them into podcast form.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.480]   The free business idea.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.040]   I'm not going to do it, but you might.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.040]   You can't go and engage with the audio that Ben Franklin recorded.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.040]   You can't go and have a video chat with Julius Caesar, but you can read their words.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.560]   And this is the thing that makes books so incredibly valuable.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.040]   Books are the most timeless form of communication that we have.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:47.840]   Since the invention of the written word, we have a connection to millennia of human history.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.920]   That is amazing.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.960]   And you can access it with the skills that you already have.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.280]   Many people are frequently complimentary to me about the breadth of knowledge that I've
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   developed, perhaps some of the points of wisdom that I work to share with you.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.480]   There are many reasons for that.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.000]   First, I believe that the fear of God is the beginning of all wisdom.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.440]   That is the single thing that sets everything else in an intellectual life aright.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.240]   But then as you go and you accumulate experience, you don't have to be stuck accumulating your
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.880]   own experience in your own life.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.880]   Rather, you can accumulate the experience of the lives of others.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.800]   So you can take a book written by a man who's 85 years old, who sits down at the end of
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.680]   his life and shares carefully the lessons that he learned across those 85 years with
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.840]   you.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.680]   And you, in the course of three days to read the book, you can gain the benefit of those
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.880]   85 years of wisdom.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.640]   And when you do that over and over and over and over and over again, it matures your thinking,
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.240]   it matures your ideas, it matures your perspective, it matures your wisdom in a way that nothing
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.120]   else can.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.920]   Books are timeless.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.900]   And that is so valuable because then it allows you to pull out from the arc of history.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.880]   And instead of being stuck in the current world saying, "Well, this is the way things
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.400]   are and this is the way things always have been," you can see the trends and the flows
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.720]   and have a grasp of history that minimum is basically go to about 4,000 years of recorded
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.640]   human history and have a pretty good idea of the last 4,000 years.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.080]   Now as you look forward over the next couple dozen years, it's not so intimidating if you
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.760]   have that understanding of what has happened over the last 4,000 years.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.440]   Next number three, books are simple to create.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.120]   Not easy, but they're simple to create.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.480]   Thus, they're accessible to almost any creator.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:55.920]   You can today sit down and with nothing but a 58-cent composition book and a couple of
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.920]   pens from a free giveaway, write a book.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.360]   Throughout human history, the vast majority of books have been simply written down in
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.680]   a notebook.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.600]   There was no skill with Adobe Premiere Pro.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.360]   There was no skill with Audacity.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.080]   There was no skill needed with a desktop publishing program.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.240]   You needed a pen and a paper and you could write a book.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.640]   And the vast majority of books in human history have been written in exactly that way, with
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.160]   somebody with a pen and a paper.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.880]   And so what this means is you can have access to the minds of people that you'll never gain
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:47.760]   access to with modern media, normal, common, ordinary people who simply had the self-discipline
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.920]   and wisdom to sit down and write.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.280]   When I was a kid, one of the jobs that I had, I actually typed an autobiography for a friend
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.480]   of ours and he sat down and he wrote it.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   He retired from his work.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.480]   He was a teacher.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.320]   He sat down with a stack of yellow legal pads and he wrote his book.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.560]   And this is how most books have been written throughout history.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.280]   I just finished reading the Laura Ingalls Wilder series to my children.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.360]   And I read the previous series.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.880]   I hadn't read the final book in the series called The First Four Years when I was a kid.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.120]   And I was reading in the introduction of it that that book was published posthumously.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.720]   But Laura had sat down, she had these orange colored notebooks and she wrote the books
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.600]   just with a pen and paper.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   And so that means that throughout history, since the invention of written language, of
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:42.440]   the printed word, since the invention of vocabulary, of the alphabet, you have access to simple
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.440]   ordinary people.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.360]   And then throughout history, there have been people who have verbalized and spoken their
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.900]   books to a scribe.
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:55.440]   For example, one of the most important writers of the New Testament is the Apostle Paul.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.780]   The Apostle Paul wrote all of his letters by dictating them to a scribe.
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:07.420]   And yet you have this treasure trove of history in printed form that's 2,000 years old.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.600]   So that's an incredible thing.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.720]   Books can be... so you have access to almost any creator.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.520]   And even still today, I get all kinds of wacky, random books from normal people.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.300]   The vast majority of books aren't bestsellers.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.640]   And so books give you the access to normal people, which really helps when you're looking
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.440]   at your ability to understand life.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:37.040]   Number four, one of the most important things, books can be consumed in a non-linear format,
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.400]   which means you can consume them in a fast and effective way.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.240]   What's wrong with this podcast right now?
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.400]   One of the things that's wrong with it is there's no way for you to listen to the end
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   of my show without listening to me go word by word.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.520]   Now I teased you a little bit a few minutes ago.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.440]   I told you some of the things that I'm going to talk about because I'm trying to get you
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.800]   to stay listening, but you don't have any way to reliably skip ahead.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.400]   I've got this show packed so full of pithy information that you know if you just skip
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   30 minutes in, you're going to miss a whole bunch of really good stuff.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.520]   So you have to sit here and listen word by word, sentence by sentence.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.040]   And it's the same thing with other forms, video, audio.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:26.560]   Those forms of information can only be consumed in a linear format.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.080]   Otherwise you might miss something important, but that's not true for books.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:37.480]   I was recently asked by a listener to give my comments on what books they should read.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.960]   And my answer was, it's not a matter of a book or a handful of books.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.640]   What you do is you read all the books.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.000]   I have for years read a couple of hundred books per year.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.920]   Now when I write that, I put read in quotes because I'm not sitting, I don't sit there
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.880]   and read from the introduction to the end, but I have legitimately for years read a couple
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.240]   of hundred books per year.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.640]   Because you can do that with books.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.720]   And as we get to it, we talk about how to read a book.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.760]   You can do that especially with certain genres of books, certain types of books as they apply
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   to your life.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.240]   You don't need to sit there and spend the 15 hours on a book in order to consume it
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.480]   cover to cover.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.720]   You can look at it and today I can read any financial book in about 15 minutes.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.400]   And then I could give a lecture on it.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.840]   And I'll talk about where that skill comes from.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.600]   But that's only possible with books because of the physical format of a printed book where
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.320]   you can sit and you can do a quick overview of it and get the main ideas very, very quickly.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.920]   And here I should note we're talking about nonfiction books.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.360]   That means that your ability to consume is so much bigger.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.440]   Your ability to learn is so much bigger than anything else.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.840]   Half of my audiences right now listening to me speak at 2x speed.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.160]   That's great.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.040]   But you can read at 15x speed.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.120]   That's wonderful.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:08.440]   You can't skim anything else other than the written printed text.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.040]   Now there are downsides of books, but only a few.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   The biggest one is storability.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.400]   Where do you put them?
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.200]   That's a downside, but that can be solved with digital books.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.240]   I created a show on Radical Personal Finance talking about how I digitized my entire library.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.240]   As I record this show, I'm looking at the screen of my laptop and I have my current
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:33.240]   library with 2,261 books in it, all accessible right here in front of me.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.440]   And that's powerful.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.280]   That gives me a tremendous tool because now, and in fact it's much better than having it
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.300]   all in a home library, now I have access to it wherever I am.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.800]   If a listener calls, and a lot of times on a Q&A show, somebody calls and asks me a question,
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.920]   sometimes I don't know it.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   And so while I'm starting my answer, I grab my library, I think of the book where I know
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.160]   the answer is, and I immediately go there.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.120]   And it's invisible to you.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.400]   But so there are benefits to a digital library.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.000]   You can solve the downside of the storability.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.080]   The only real downside of reading a book is the inability to multitask.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:13.160]   You can multitask and run, jog, drive, walk the dog, whatever you're doing, doing tedio
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.520]   repetitive tasks while you're listening to my words.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.600]   It's a wonderful benefit of podcasts and audio books, et cetera.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.440]   But you can't multitask when reading.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.720]   That's the only downside that I know of to reading.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.900]   So let's talk about how to read.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:37.440]   And the first thing that you need to know in how to read is not decoding the text, but
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.480]   knowing how to choose the books that you're going to read.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.760]   Now one element is, of course, in choosing the books to read, knowing what your reading
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.000]   level is.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.060]   If I give my six-year-old an advanced 800-page book on tax planning, he can't even scratch
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.680]   the surface of it.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.880]   That does him no good.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.300]   So yes, there is an element of skill.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:11.000]   But the most important thing about reading is to read the right books, to select the
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.160]   books that you're reading based upon your goals.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.720]   Only a tiny percentage of the population reads.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.260]   I've heard statistics that two-thirds of high school graduates, after they graduate from
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.160]   high school, never read another book in their life.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.200]   Half of college graduates never read another book in their life.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.840]   I don't know if those things are true or not.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.880]   I don't doubt them.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.280]   I do know that the vast majority of people never read much, and if they do read, they
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.900]   read a couple of books a year.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.880]   So the first thing is reading any book is going to help you.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:55.060]   But if you really want to turbocharge your results, you filter what you read based upon
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.200]   what you want to accomplish.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.880]   So you start by making a list of your personal goals.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.140]   Those of you who started following me on Instagram know I've been doing a goal series where I'm
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.880]   teaching on Instagram how to set and achieve goals.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.160]   And it starts very simply.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.240]   Go Instagram.com/JoshuaSheets.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.460]   Follow me there, Joshua Sheets, S-H-E-A-T-S.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.000]   But it starts very, very simply.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.080]   It starts with a blank sheet of paper, ideally a notebook, and a pen.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:30.600]   And you write at the top, "Today's date," and you write, "I write Joshua's goals," and
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.240]   then you make a list and you start writing.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.620]   And you write down what your goals are.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.160]   That's where you start.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.900]   You don't need any other prompts other than that.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.220]   Now, if you want more prompts, we can give them to you, but just write down what your
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.580]   goals are.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.580]   And here's the thing.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.580]   They're your goals.
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.300]   They're not my goals, and their goals can be anything you want them to be.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.220]   Now, if you do nothing more than sit down with a piece of paper and write down what
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:01.340]   your goals are, you will automatically move yourself from the bottom 80% of society to
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.620]   the top 20% of society, because you're going to become somebody who's actually going after
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.620]   something, somebody who actually has a goal, somebody who's actually making progress.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.780]   You don't actually have to do anything that I'm telling you the rest of this show.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.580]   If you just do that, it'll transform your life, because now you'll have an idea of what
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.020]   you're looking for.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.420]   But of course, you can turbocharge your results if you go a step farther.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.300]   So after you start to get a clear idea of what your goals are, whether you write them
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.420]   down one day or you write them down every day for a month or whatever you do, then the
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.260]   next thing is you start to make a plan.
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.900]   You say, "How can I achieve this goal?
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.260]   What do I want to do, and how can I actually achieve this goal?"
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:49.060]   When you start to make plans, you start to see how you can accomplish goals.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:57.680]   Now, in your plans, the next step is you say, "What skills do I need to develop in order
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.980]   to achieve this particular goal?"
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.740]   When you get to the skills, you get to your reading list.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.660]   Let me give you an example.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.100]   Let's say that you say, "I hear Joshua every day.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.740]   He says, 'Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to helping you build a rich
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.780]   and meaningful life now while providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and ..." I
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.460]   just messed up my own line.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.700]   Anyway, financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.400]   You'd think I could get that right.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.400]   Financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400]   You know what?
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.220]   I would like to be financially free in 10 years or less.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.700]   How can I do that?
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.420]   Well, you think.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.300]   One good question would be, "Why am I not financially free yet?"
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.700]   Ask yourself that question and start writing answers to that.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.580]   Perhaps you answer that question, you say, "Well, I'm a bad money manager.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.140]   I don't manage my money well."
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.400]   You know that.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.920]   If you stink at managing money, you already know that.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.340]   What you do is you convert it into a skill.
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:07.860]   I need to become more skilled at managing my money.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.300]   I need to become more skilled at managing my money.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:18.880]   Now that you have a skill, you think about a reading list.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.860]   How can I learn to be more skilled at managing my money?
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.420]   You start looking for books that will help you to become more skilled at managing your
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.420]   money.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.700]   Now, perhaps your answer is, "Why am I not financially free yet?"
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.180]   is, "I don't have a plan."
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.740]   So you think, "How can I develop the skill of building a plan for financial freedom?"
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.360]   Start looking for a book on that.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.780]   Or maybe you say, "You know what?
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.700]   I just don't believe good things about money.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.900]   I have limiting beliefs on money."
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.240]   So you look for a book that will help you develop the skills of developing new beliefs
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.260]   about money.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.620]   Or maybe you say, "I'm not financially free because I'm just not earning enough.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.700]   I make a low income.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.900]   I'm not earning much money."
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.500]   Well, what skills do you need?
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.420]   I need to earn more money, which means I need to develop a financially valuable skill.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.900]   I need to do a better job at my—better work at my job.
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.920]   So how can I do better work at my job?
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.840]   Maybe I'll take a book on how to be a better employee.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.420]   Maybe I'll take a book on how to work harder.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.260]   Maybe I'll take a book at how to be a better salesman.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.420]   Something.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.700]   Maybe you look and say, "Why am I not financially free yet?
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.420]   Because I'm paying too much in tax."
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:29.100]   Well, now the skill is I need to become a skilled tax planner so that I can reduce my
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.400]   tax bill.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.980]   Now we know what you need to read.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.580]   Or maybe I don't know how to invest my money, so now I need to get a book on investing my
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.780]   money.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:44.380]   The magic of reading is when you read books that will help you develop the skills and
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.580]   knowledge that you need to achieve your goals.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.780]   The people who do that get on the fast track.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.660]   The people who read randomly are in the top 20%.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:01.060]   But the people who read to their skills that they need to accomplish their goals are the
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:08.660]   ones who are in the top 4%, which is the top 20% of the top 20%, which is where 67% of
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:14.660]   the income, 67% of the wealth always comes.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:22.340]   Right now, if you turn off this podcast and you just take that idea and you start with
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:28.720]   goals and then you ask yourself, "What skills do I need to develop to achieve these goals?"
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:35.700]   and then you start reading books to help you acquire those skills, you can be on the fast
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.220]   track.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.740]   So you must read the right books.
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:49.860]   And the right books are not the books that have influenced another person the most.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:57.300]   Those may be good books, but the right books are the books that help you acquire the skills
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:03.100]   that you need to achieve your goals.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:08.020]   Now there is benefit in reading other books.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.780]   There is benefit in exposing yourself to other things.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.780]   That's a benefit.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.540]   I do think you should read widely, but you don't have to.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:25.660]   The biggest benefit from reading widely is a diversity of ideas and a diversity of perspectives
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.600]   that you can start to develop.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:35.240]   Your basic tools here are a library and/or a bookstore.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.540]   Because what will happen is your Amazon recommendations are going to be curated to the things that
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.540]   you're searching for.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.860]   But a library and a bookstore allow you to go in and simply browse.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.940]   Libraries are the best because you can take all the books home.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:51.380]   I was a homeschooler when I was a kid and homeschoolers max out their library card every
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.380]   single week.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.500]   They always limited us to, I think it was 50 books.
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:00.620]   And so whenever I went to the library, I would take a duffel bag and I would get 50 books.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:08.500]   Now I didn't read 50 books in a week cover to cover, but I did read 50 books in a week
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.920]   cover to cover.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.480]   It wasn't word by word, but it was enough to expose me to ideas.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.020]   And one of the wonderful things about that is when you can walk into a library and you
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.300]   know you can have 50 books from there, you just wander the aisles and anything that looks
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.920]   interesting or sounds interesting, you grab it.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.860]   So that's where you read 10 books on architectural design.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:34.300]   I read books on flying helicopters and sailing and hunting and anything that piqued my interest.
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.800]   Read books on automotive repair, et cetera.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.160]   And what those things do is they expose you to ideas.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:46.780]   The thing that I have seen most stark recently when mentoring a young man that I've known
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:53.580]   for a very long time is how unimaginative he is about life.
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:24:00.480]   He's not a reader by the way, but the reason he's unimaginative is he has no exposure.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.440]   He's lived such a sheltered life and never been exposed to the opportunities that are
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.280]   out there in the world that he can't imagine anything other than doing the same work that
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.080]   his dad has done his entire life.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:18.200]   That is ineffably sad.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.640]   Get yourself a library card, get a duffel bag, go to the library and check out 50 books.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.360]   Won't cost you a dime.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.400]   You don't need a plan.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.060]   You don't need to do anything except wander the aisles and grab things that look interesting.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:35.340]   Take them home, spend 15 or 20 minutes flipping through them, stop and read a page here and
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.040]   there if something grabs your interest.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.280]   Do that every week for a year and you'll have now a little bit of diversity in your thinking,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   a little bit of diversity in your ideas.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.620]   That's the kind of diversity that matters.
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.080]   Diversity is a strength when it's a diversity of ideas and perspectives.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.900]   That's the diversity that you need in your brain.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.100]   Now to the process of reading.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:05.400]   The first thing that you need is the ability to decode language.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.440]   That's step one.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.980]   To begin at the beginning, if you don't have the ability to read, you need to learn.
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.460]   You need, in English, you need phonics.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:20.600]   You need the ability to sound out the letters in order to become a skilled reader.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.240]   English is a weird language because it's a Germanic language with a Latin vocabulary.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.200]   It's a Germanic language with a Latin vocabulary.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.600]   That's why it is challenging to learn.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.820]   But there are only, what is it, 70, 80 basic sounds in the English language and then various
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.720]   combinations that make those sounds.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.360]   Anybody can be taught to read within a few months if you sit down and you work your way
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.960]   through a good phonics program.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.640]   Many people have that basic scenario, where they have that basic understanding, but they
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.880]   struggle to figure out, "Well, I don't read quickly.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.080]   I read really slowly."
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.200]   In my experience, your reading speed itself is going to be based on two things.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:07.560]   Number one, your experience reading, the amount of time that you've actually spent decoding
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.560]   the letters and sounds of words.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:15.820]   And number two, your familiarity with the topic at hand and your grasp of its vocabulary
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:20.720]   of words and vocabulary of ideas.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:27.440]   The first one is the important one to start with, the actual ability that you have to
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.120]   decode the letters.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.240]   What I would recommend to you is what I recommend to children, what I did when I was a child,
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.800]   is simply this.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:40.760]   Find words that are part of books and stories that you like to read.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.320]   Now I think this is less of a problem than it was in the past because for all of the
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:50.200]   downsides of digital consumption, I think the modern person is reading many more words
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.180]   on a daily basis than the average person 50 years ago.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.960]   You can't flip through your social media streams without reading constantly.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.840]   And so I think, although I can't prove it, I think there's probably actually an increase
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.980]   in the number of words being read and consumed today versus the past.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.360]   But the key is to find something that you like reading.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.480]   And for here, I would recommend to you fiction.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:19.260]   A good fictional story, a good story will grab you in a way that nonfiction won't.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:24.640]   Now for reading to your goals, to your skills, you're going to need to read nonfiction.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.400]   But for reading for your basic ability to read, read fiction.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.500]   And so figure out the kinds of stories that you like and start reading them.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:38.960]   Now that may be dragon stories, it may be romance stories, it may be detective adventure
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.360]   stories, I don't know.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.560]   But figure out what stories you like to read and start reading them.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:51.000]   A few dozen novels under your belt over the next year will massively improve your ability
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.800]   to decode the sounds of the language that you're reading.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:02.200]   So if you're not a reader, don't try to start necessarily with Joshua's hardcore books,
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.920]   start with some novels and develop the love of reading a novel.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:14.120]   Now once you have a base in a certain, and you have a basic level of ability to read,
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:19.480]   if you can read a couple of paragraphs out of a novel smoothly without struggling, now
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.920]   you're ready to go to that other discussion of reading speed.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:30.800]   A note on speed reading, I don't speed read in the sense of processing words any faster
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   than other people.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.680]   There are people who do that, they seem to, their brains seem to work in a different way.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.480]   I don't have any particular skill.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.200]   I've read some books on speed reading, I've tried some of the techniques, I never found
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.640]   those particular strategies that were taught in the speed reading books to be helpful to
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   me.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.600]   I don't think that speed reading is necessarily a key skill that is necessary.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:58.440]   At least if it is, I developed it organically, not with practicing some kind of technique.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:04.360]   What I have learned for myself is that my reading speed is going to be based on my familiarity
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:09.160]   with the topic and my grasp of its vocabulary.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:15.720]   The reason I can read a financial book in 15 minutes is that I know the language and
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.520]   I know the vocabulary, the vocabulary of the words and the ideas.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.400]   I'm not stymied when I read qualified plan.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.480]   I know what a qualified plan means.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.280]   That has a specific technical definition that I understand and so when I read the words
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.240]   qualified plan, I don't say, "Huh, what is that?"
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.960]   I know what a mutual fund is.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.200]   I know what a closed-end mutual fund is.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   I know what an open-end mutual fund is.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.600]   I know what a guaranteed investment contract is.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.120]   I have a grasp of all of these basic ideas.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.560]   But if you don't have that grasp of the ideas, when you read that word, it won't put a picture
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.680]   in your head.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.320]   The information won't flow into its proper category.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:04.840]   Based on reading syntopically over the years in the world of finance, I have mental cubbyholes
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.680]   for most concepts.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.960]   Now every now and then a new concept will come along and that's extremely valuable,
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.560]   but I have enough familiarity with the subject to know where those concepts are and when
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.640]   they see them, they jump up on the page at me.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640]   I've described that.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.680]   For example, the best, I did a show on the math, the shockingly simple math of early
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.080]   retirement, best blog that Mr. Money Mustache ever wrote, Jacob Lund Fisker with his book
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.600]   Early Retirement Extreme.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.560]   When I ran across that concept, it was a fundamentally new idea for me.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.720]   I didn't have a cubbyhole for it.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   And so immediately it just blew off the page and I said, that's a new idea.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.760]   And the same thing will happen with you, with your field of interest.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:52.000]   Now if I go and read a book, a medical textbook, or even just a popular level, not a professional
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.760]   level, a popular level book on health, I struggle sometimes because I don't have the concept.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.840]   For example, I don't know what an amino acid actually is.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.360]   I know what the word is.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   I know what it means.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.000]   People throw it around, but I don't know what an amino acid actually is.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.880]   And I don't understand how an amino acid works.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.120]   I understand what an endowment life insurance contract is and how it works, but I don't
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.280]   know what an amino acid is.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.280]   I know it's important.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.380]   I know it has some function, but I don't have the vocabulary for it.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:30.200]   So when I read a book on health and nutrition, I struggle much more.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.600]   I can't read one of those books in 15 minutes because I don't have all the cubbyholes.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.160]   Now that's not to say I shouldn't do it, but I'm pointing out that it's based upon your
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.160]   familiarity with the concepts.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.760]   Now if you're reading to your business, say you're reading about marketing, you're going
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:53.200]   to have a mental map of all of the concepts of your trade.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.720]   And so you're going to be consuming books on marketing and you're always looking for
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.040]   new idea, new idea.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.900]   You don't need the old ideas.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:04.900]   You will recognize the basic application of certain ideas.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:10.140]   When I read personal finance books, I've got decades, meaning I've been reading them for
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.260]   decades, but I've got decades and decades worth of the concepts built up.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.540]   So I've read the books from the 50s.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.540]   I've read the books from the 70s.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.060]   I've read the books of the 90s.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.460]   And so I can see how the concepts are just a slight change, a slight adjustment.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.860]   Yeah, that tax rule no longer applies, but here's this other one, et cetera.
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.620]   And so on a popular level, over time you'll build the skill and the knowledge of the vocabulary
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.460]   that should be encouraging to you because what it means is you can get better.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:39.300]   And then once you're better, you can stay current on a subject without investing that
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.380]   much time.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.580]   You might go at a deeper level.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.640]   I have complex books on estate planning.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.780]   When I read those, I cannot read them quickly.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:52.140]   I have to go slowly because I didn't work for years and years in the field of estate
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.140]   planning.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.180]   I have to stop and think, okay, all right.
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.700]   Is this a lead trust or an annuity trust?
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.660]   Okay, it's a charitable lead trust.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.820]   That means that this is left and I have all these mental triggers to bring out the definition,
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.220]   but I'm not conversant in it in the same way I am at the popular level.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.980]   So there's always a growth in your reading skills.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.580]   So don't worry about reading quickly.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.480]   Worry first about reading the right books.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.060]   And if you're reading the right books that are going to give you the skills that you
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:23.820]   need towards your job and you've chosen those books carefully, then it's worth it to work
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.860]   your way through them slowly, systematically, little by little.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.300]   It's worth it to take them a few pages at a day and to grapple with the concepts because
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.140]   they're to your goals.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.580]   If they're not to your goals, don't bother reading them if they're hard.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.020]   If it's not going to help you, just get rid of it.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.660]   There's no reason to waste the time.
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:47.100]   The next big challenge we have to work out is having time to read.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.100]   Many people say, "I don't have time to read."
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.940]   Well, that's of course a stupid and erroneous excuse.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.900]   Of course you have time to read.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.420]   You have 24 hours in your day.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.340]   I have 24 hours in my day.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.100]   We all have exactly the same time.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.300]   So you have time to do anything that you want to do.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.020]   So it's a stupid and wrong excuse.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.460]   Of course you have time to read.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.900]   The accurate statement would be, "I haven't made time to read."
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:15.300]   Or "I haven't decided to dedicate time to reading."
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.340]   "I haven't chosen to read."
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.940]   Those are all accurate statements if you're struggling with, "When should I read?"
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.780]   But you do have to decide, "When are you going to read?"
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.460]   I just say, "Read whenever you want, but make time to read."
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.500]   What I do is I read in the morning.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:37.420]   And I find that that works effectively for me because I can get up, I can read, my brain
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:42.020]   is calm, I'm focused, and that's my time of thinking.
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:45.580]   Most of the time I try to get up long before my children do.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:50.460]   These days I don't set alarm clocks because my biggest challenge in the past has been
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.460]   not getting enough sleep.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.140]   You get super excited and get up early and then all of a sudden my body gets run down
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:55.460]   because I don't get enough sleep.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:00.460]   So as long as I can discipline myself to get to bed on time, then I know that when my body
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.100]   is done sleeping, I will wake up in the morning.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.380]   Especially that's important if you're a parent.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.140]   You know as well as I know that you don't get the same quantity or quality of sleep
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.660]   that you got when you weren't a parent.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.140]   When you could just go to bed, and I always went to bed, slept, and woke up.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.500]   Of course now at this point, you've got the baby waking up, sometimes your children wake
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.940]   up, and so your sleep is much lower quality.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.020]   So I don't set an alarm clock.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.660]   I just simply allow my body to be done sleeping when I'm done sleeping.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:31.020]   But still usually I've gotten to a point where as long as I go to bed at the proper time,
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.460]   I wake up early in the morning, 5 o'clock, 4.30, something like that.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:41.100]   And then I try to have that hour, hour and a half of reading, quietness, journaling,
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:45.660]   thinking, praying, studying, etc. that comes in the morning.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.220]   For some people that doesn't work.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.380]   Some people read at night.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.060]   Some people read on their lunch break.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.100]   Doesn't matter when you read.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.420]   It simply matters that you read.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:59.100]   The key is to figure out a trigger that's going to cause you to read.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:04.740]   So for me, if I take out my phone and I go on social media in the morning, I'm going
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.820]   to lose all my reading time.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:10.620]   But if I leave my phone in airplane mode, so there's no notifications, nothing comes
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:16.260]   in, and I start with a cup of coffee and a book and a notebook, then I'm in a situation
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.900]   where I can really make progress.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:23.660]   Then I'm in a situation where I can improve things and I'm not distracted by those things
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.380]   that seem easier than reading.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:32.180]   And then once I actually start the process of reading, I make progress very, very quickly.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:37.940]   We've talked about reading to your goals and reading to develop the skills that you need
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.020]   to reach your goals.
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:44.220]   Next, you have to get a book that you want to read.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.420]   So you have to choose that.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.460]   Now you can choose that a number of different ways.
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.080]   The first thing and most important thing is simply to start.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:58.020]   If you said, "I want to get a book on learning how to make money, how to earn more," you
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.140]   can just go to Amazon and type "how to earn more money" or go to your local bookstore
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.060]   and pick any book.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:11.420]   Because in the beginning, your ability to grow will be so huge that any book that you
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.420]   can get your hands on will help you.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:20.820]   Realistically, you're going to find a handful of ideas in any book because you're only going
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.660]   to be able to implement a handful of ideas in any book.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.900]   That's not to say that a book is not full of dozens and dozens and dozens of good ideas,
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:34.780]   but very rarely do we ever have the ability to mine any one book for dozens and dozens
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.780]   of ideas.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.000]   We just can't do that many things at once.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.520]   So it doesn't really matter what book it is because you're just going to need a couple
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.940]   of ideas from that book.
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:51.740]   The process of improvement, the process of reaching goals is an iterative process.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.120]   You don't start with the perfect plan and then execute it.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.140]   You start with the plan that you've got and you incrementally iterate.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:05.340]   You incrementally make progress and improvements with one idea here, one idea there, one piece
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.480]   of knowledge here, one piece of knowledge there.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.340]   If you think that somehow there's one magical book that's going to solve your problems,
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.580]   you're mistaken.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:18.380]   If I gave you that magical book that could solve all your problems, if I gave you Joshua's
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:24.780]   book on financial manual that's going to solve all your problems, you could not possibly
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.580]   gain all the things from it because you're not at a place where you can gain all the
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.180]   things from it.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:35.580]   There are beginner ideas, there are intermediate ideas, and there are expert level of ideas
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.940]   that come in books.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:42.940]   But you will not see the expert or intermediate ideas until you've passed through the beginning
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.220]   stages.
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.980]   Years ago I played basketball briefly in high school.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:52.620]   The problem with my choosing to play basketball briefly in high school was that I didn't play
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.540]   basketball before deciding to ever go and play basketball in high school.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:04.820]   And so I went and I tried out for the basketball tryouts and they were shooting layups.
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.860]   And to my shame or whatever, you can laugh at me, I had never shot a layup.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.340]   I didn't know how to shoot a layup.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:16.780]   Here I was at 16, 17 years old, I was a senior in high school playing basketball my first
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.620]   year and I didn't know how to shoot a layup.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.340]   And so the assistant coach took me to the side of the court and taught me how to shoot
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.340]   a layup.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:33.300]   Now the question is, would there have been any use whatsoever in trying to teach the
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:40.100]   17 year old Joshua some intricate advanced basketball concept?
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.380]   I don't know what those advanced concepts are, it's not my interest.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.380]   But there would have been no point.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.100]   What you need is, hey, let's see if you can shoot the ball.
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.180]   Let's teach you how to shoot a layup.
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.820]   You need the basics.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:56.100]   And so the same thing happens in every other industry, every other skill area.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.060]   You have to learn the basics.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.940]   I cannot see basketball strategy.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:07.300]   Now I learned a lot in my first year of playing, I won an only year of playing.
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.140]   But prior to that, I didn't know what a zone defense was.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.820]   I didn't know what a man-to-man defense was because I hadn't been playing.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.460]   I never watched basketball, never played basketball, just decided to play my senior year.
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.020]   That's the way it is in life.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:24.060]   You wind up putting yourself in situations and you can't see what's happening.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:28.300]   So in finance, when you become an expert, you can see what's happening.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:34.600]   You can see the commonality, you can see the threads, but you won't see those at the beginning.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.420]   So you have to build your way to it.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:42.180]   So for that reason, it almost doesn't matter what book you read because any book is going
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.940]   to have a few concepts in it that you can take and apply to your life.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:56.340]   So get a book that you want to read, choose a book, any book, then make it yours.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:03.300]   One of the major mistakes that people make is they don't make their books theirs.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:08.020]   And this is where I don't like libraries.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:13.620]   You are choosing to read this book for a reason.
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.300]   The reason you're choosing to read this book, nonfiction book, I always get novels from
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:21.140]   libraries, there's no point in having novels, no point in paying for them unless you just
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:26.540]   want to for convenience, but for nonfiction books, you're choosing to read this book because
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:32.980]   it's going to give you knowledge and ideas that you can use to develop your skills, which
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.620]   will lead to your accomplishing your goals.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:41.700]   The only way that will happen is if you can transfer that knowledge and those skills from
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.340]   the book into your life.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:50.620]   You need to take what's in that book and you need to get it into your brain and into your
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.620]   body.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.700]   And this is going to require from you work.
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:42:00.700]   You're going to have to grapple with the ideas and the concepts in the book.
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.620]   We're not reading fiction.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.640]   It's not a nice story that's going to make you feel good when you're done with it.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.620]   We're reading to accomplish your goals.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.260]   So you have to make it yours.
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.820]   And to do that, you're going to destroy the book.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.460]   Now that destruction is going to result in you actually grasping the concepts, but you've
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:23.780]   got to transfer the ideas from that book into your head.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.020]   And in so doing, you are going to destroy that book for anyone else.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.120]   That book must become yours.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.740]   So should you get books from the library?
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.640]   Sure, but not serious books.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.360]   You should use the library for browsing, for exposure, et cetera.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.180]   But if you get a book from the library and you're flipping your way through it and you
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.180]   say, "You know what?
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:50.900]   This book is really good," immediately buy that book or just go pay the library for it.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.700]   If it's that good, just destroy it and say, "Sorry, I lost it.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.620]   Here's $25," and buy the book.
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:43:02.800]   Buy the book because it would be a poor use of time and money for you to consume that
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:07.700]   book and not to make it yours.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.700]   You'll only get a little bit out of it.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.500]   Make the book yours.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.660]   You don't have to read all the books you buy.
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.460]   That's the other thing.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:22.620]   But you do have to buy the books you're going to really learn from.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.300]   They need to be yours.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:30.820]   Books have never been cheaper than they are today, especially the used book marketplace.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.900]   The greatest boon to readers right now is Amazon used books.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:40.980]   Almost any book you go on, it'll be one penny plus $3.49 shipping.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.640]   You can get any book in the world for basically four bucks, five books.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.460]   If the used market has the book for 30 bucks, get it anyway because now you know it's a
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.860]   good book.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.360]   But almost any book for four, three, four, five books.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.380]   So make it yours.
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:59.900]   First thing you do when you get a book, you take a big juicy pen, you write your name
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:06.820]   inside the front of it, and you write the date that you read it.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.820]   Month and year.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   Why?
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.300]   Well, first, don't lend out your books.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:15.020]   If you want to lend a book to somebody, buy another copy and give it to them, ship it
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.020]   to them.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.020]   But don't lend out your books.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.580]   You will never get them back and the people will never read your books.
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.580]   They don't do it.
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:26.060]   If somebody doesn't care enough about a subject to take your recommendation to buy the book
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.500]   themselves, they're not going to do anything with it.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.020]   But if you still feel guilty and you want to actually help them in some way, then give
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.300]   them the book.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.780]   But don't lend out your books.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:35.780]   This is your book.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.980]   It has your name on it.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:43.880]   Write your name and the date so that you can have an idea of when you read that book.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.580]   Now when you go to read, here's what you do.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:49.060]   You first need to have the tools of reading.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:54.100]   And the tools of reading are most importantly a pen.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.780]   You have to have a pen when you're reading.
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.860]   Secondly, a highlighter.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.660]   A highlighter is good.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.100]   Third, a ruler.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:09.100]   Now throughout my lifetime what I've always liked is blue pens and yellow highlighters.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.280]   I like yellow highlighters because they allow you to highlight the things that you want
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:17.180]   to highlight without being so disruptive to the reading experience like pink and green
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.640]   and blue.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:22.900]   I have over the last few years stopped using highlighters and gone exclusively to pens.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:26.340]   And the reason is that I scan all my books now.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:32.700]   So if I read a physical book, I begin with a pen and when I scan it, one of the things
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.840]   that's important is of course you can scan the book in color.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:41.540]   So I sometimes scan books in color and the color scan version will show the highlighter,
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.860]   it'll show the yellow and the blue, etc.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:48.900]   The problem is it's not as easy to read a color scan because the paper will always have
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:52.060]   that slight off-white tint to it.
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.140]   So it shows up but it's not quite as nice.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.340]   Whereas when I scan books, I put it on to black and white.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.500]   And when you put a scanner on to a black and white setting, then it turns everything to
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.160]   black and white which means that you lose your yellow highlighting.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:08.460]   You don't lose green and blue and pink highlighting but it becomes dark and it's hard to read
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:09.460]   it.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.060]   So because I now scan, I've stopped using highlighters in favor of pens.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:18.000]   So I underline, that's what the ruler is for, I make notes, etc. so that all those notes
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.600]   will remain once I scan the book.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.620]   So you can consider doing that as well.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.980]   But you've got to have those tools of reading.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.740]   You've got to write the book.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.580]   You've got to write in the book because you're going to engage with the arguments of the
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:31.580]   author.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:34.620]   And as you're consuming a book, the book may have 300 pages, there's only going to be a
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:40.840]   few key ideas and so you've got to actually be able to engage with those ideas.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.820]   Make sure you have the tools of reading ready.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:50.420]   Now this point, you have chosen a book that is going to help you develop a skill that
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:55.180]   you need to acquire in order for you to achieve your goals, which means that you have an interest
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.720]   in this book.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.420]   You've acquired the book, it's in your hands and you've got the tools of reading.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.940]   Quick comment on digital books.
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:03.940]   I like digital books.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:09.940]   I read a lot of digital books now because of my internationally mobile lifestyle.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.460]   I can't get Amazon deliveries.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:17.360]   I can't get books as easily and so digital books are a great boon.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:22.100]   Digital books are nice but they're not so good because they have that problem of linearity.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.600]   You have to read them from the front to the back.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.100]   It's hard to scan a digital book.
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:30.700]   They do have a place but the best is, especially if you're a beginning reader, start with the
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.020]   physical book.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:37.940]   Your first action is to pre-read the book.
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:44.620]   Now for a pre-reading, I'm going to here refer you briefly to a couple of pages in Mortimer
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.900]   Adler's classic book called How to Read a Book and of course I'm riffing on his title.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:56.380]   But How to Read a Book is a good book but it's very important for academic, philosophical
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:00.560]   books, deeper books, the great books, the great history of ideas, etc.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.380]   It's not so important for what we're talking about necessarily.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.620]   It's a good book that you should probably read but it's beyond what's necessary for
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.540]   most of what we're talking about.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:16.380]   But in that book, Adler talks about the different levels of reading.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:20.340]   Now since I have my copy and since I read it carefully, I can go right to the levels
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.340]   of reading and I can use his four levels.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:27.220]   I've got with my marginalia, I have those levels clearly outlined.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:31.580]   So I can, without re-reading the book, I can immediately know I'm going to talk about these
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:32.740]   four levels of reading.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.740]   I know right where to go and my system of marginalia, which I'll talk to you about in
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.300]   a moment, is going to clearly show me what I need.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.660]   So here are the four levels of reading.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.220]   Number one, the first level of reading is called elementary reading.
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:49.980]   Other names might be rudimentary reading, basic reading, or initial reading.
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:53.940]   Any one of these terms serves to suggest that as one masters this level, one passes from
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:58.380]   non-literacy to at least beginning literacy.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:02.660]   In mastering this level, one learns the rudiments of the art of reading, receives basic training
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.220]   in reading, and acquires initial reading skills.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:09.180]   We prefer the name elementary reading, however, because this level of reading is ordinarily
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.540]   learned in elementary school.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.540]   So this is the level of reading which most people read, elementary reading.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:21.180]   They learn how to understand the concepts of word formation.
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:25.500]   They learn some basic vocabulary, but they don't learn how to deal with the ideas in
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.780]   books and thus, once they finish school and do the required reading, they're done.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.780]   They leave.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:33.980]   Now, the second level of reading, Adler calls inspectional reading.
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:38.820]   And inspectional reading is characterized by its special emphasis on time.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.300]   When reading at this level, the student is allowed a set time to complete an assigned
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.460]   amount of reading.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:47.260]   He might be allowed 15 minutes to read this book, for instance, or even a book twice as
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.260]   long.
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:53.700]   Hence, another way to describe this level of reading is to say that its aim is to get
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:59.340]   the most out of a book within a given time, usually a relatively short time and always,
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:03.420]   by definition, too short a time to get out of the book everything that can be gotten.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.980]   Still, another name for this level might be skimming or pre-reading.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:12.260]   However, we do not mean the kind of skimming that is characterized by casual or random
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.660]   browsing through a book.
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.020]   Inspectional reading is the art of skimming systematically.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.860]   We're going to talk about that more in a moment.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.780]   Third, the third level of reading we will call analytical reading.
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:27.820]   It is both a more complex and a more systematic activity than either of the two levels of
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.140]   reading discussed so far.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:33.500]   Depending on the difficulty of the text to be read, it makes more or less heavy demands
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.380]   on the reader.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:41.300]   Analytical reading is thorough reading, complete reading, or good reading, the best reading
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.820]   you can do.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:46.700]   If inspectional reading is the best and most complete reading that is possible given a
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:52.620]   limited time, then analytical reading is the best and most complete reading that is possible
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.540]   given unlimited time.
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:56.740]   That's analytical reading.
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.660]   Analytical reading is preeminently for the sake of understanding.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:05.340]   And then number four, the fourth and highest level of reading we will call syntopical reading.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.840]   It is the most complex and systematic type of reading of all.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.980]   It makes very heavy demands on the reader, even if the materials he is reading are themselves
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.460]   relatively easy and unsophisticated.
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.680]   Another name for this level might be comparative reading.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:24.060]   When reading syntopically, the reader reads many books, not just one, and places them
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:28.180]   in relation to one another and to a subject about which they all revolve.
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.560]   But mere comparison of texts is not enough.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.340]   Syntopical reading involves more.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:36.220]   With the help of the books read, the syntopical reader is able to construct an analysis of
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.980]   the subject that may not be in any of the books.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:43.900]   It is obvious, therefore, that syntopical reading is the most active and effortful kind
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.020]   of reading.
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:53.780]   Syntopical reading is what you do to the most important components of your goals.
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:59.140]   This will usually relate to your career, to the most important things in your personal
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.620]   life, etc.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.020]   That's where you read syntopically.
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:09.240]   With me, as a career, as a financial advisor and a financial planner, I have to read syntopically
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:15.700]   because I have to have at least a basic familiarity with all of the concepts that will affect
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.180]   my chosen career and industry.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.380]   It's the same for you.
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:24.300]   If you're involved in marketing, in order for you to advance in your career, you must
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:29.860]   read syntopically so that you have an understanding of everything related to marketing.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.060]   There's no excuse for you not to do that.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:36.700]   If you are engaged in really any activity, anything that you really care about in your
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.860]   personal life, you have to read syntopically.
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:39.860]   But we're not going to focus on that.
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:44.540]   We're going to focus on pre-reading or inspectional reading.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.580]   So when you start with a book, here is what you do.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:50.740]   And I'm going to read here from Adler, Chapter 4, the second level of reading, inspectional
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.900]   reading.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.920]   Inspectional reading is a true level of reading.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.100]   It is quite distinct from the level that precedes it, elementary reading, and from the one that
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.520]   follows it in natural sequence, analytical reading.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.340]   But as we noted in Chapter 2, the levels of reading are cumulative.
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:10.840]   Thus, elementary reading is contained in inspectional reading, as indeed, inspectional reading is
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:16.220]   contained in analytical reading and analytical reading in syntopical reading.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.700]   Practically, this means you cannot read on the inspectional level unless you can read
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.200]   effectively on the elementary level.
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:26.220]   You must be able to read an author's text more or less steadily, without having to stop
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:31.420]   to look up the meaning of many words, and without stumbling over the grammar and syntax.
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.980]   You must be able to make sense of a majority of the sentences and paragraphs, although
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.720]   not necessarily the best sense of all of them.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.760]   What then is involved in inspectional reading?
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.380]   How do you go about doing it?
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:46.960]   The first thing to realize is that there are two types of inspectional reading.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.300]   They are aspects of a single skill, but the beginning reader is well advised to consider
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.500]   them as two different steps or activities.
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:59.420]   The experienced reader learns to perform both steps simultaneously, but for the moment we
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:04.060]   will treat them as if they were quite distinct.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.060]   Inspectional reading 1.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.460]   Systematic skimming or pre-reading.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.460]   And there are two.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:09.820]   I'll give you just a moment.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.380]   And I'll insert this here.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:16.180]   So whenever an author says there are two types of reading, especially this, you know, in
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:22.340]   Adler's book, and by the way at the end I will share with you some, a way that you can
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.340]   get some information.
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:28.980]   I'll show you some pictures of even just my reading of Adler's book so you can see how
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.220]   I do it in hopes that that might inspire you or help you in some way.
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.860]   I always enjoy looking at other people's marginalia.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:40.120]   But the, whenever an author says there are two types, I immediately, with my pen, write
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.260]   two types of inspectional reading.
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:47.980]   Then I look forward and I find the categories and I write them right where it was introduced.
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:51.300]   So I have a note in my handwriting, two types of inspectional reading.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.920]   Number one, systematic skimming or pre-reading.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.820]   And number two, superficial reading.
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.160]   That allows me to properly organize the ideas as I progress.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:04.180]   The author may say there are two types, introduce the first type and go on for 10 pages.
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:07.740]   And which type, I'm going to forget about the fact that he said there was a second type.
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:12.120]   But if I immediately look forward 10 pages and see the two types listed, then I can go
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.080]   ahead and write them in the margin.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.840]   Now the conventions of writing have changed over the last 50 years.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:23.820]   Adler's book is typical of what was written 50 years ago, where there's much more prose,
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:28.240]   there's much more story in the prose, and much less outlining.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:33.440]   Today, most non-fiction books are outlined even in their basic presentation.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.520]   So there would immediately be, in general, in today's style of writing, is that there
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.520]   are two types.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:42.860]   There would immediately be a space, and number one, systematic skimming or pre-reading.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.600]   Number two, superficial reading.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.960]   But if that's not there, you still need to grasp the ideas.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.840]   And one of the things that I do that I think you should do as well is you should work on
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.520]   your taxonomy of ideas.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.720]   Now I don't know how much of this is related to my brain specifically versus all brains.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:03.800]   My brain is uniquely skilled at the taxonomy of ideas.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:08.280]   I don't know how common that skill is, but it's a unique skill that I have, and it's
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:14.200]   basically my core unique ability is the taxonomy of ideas.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.360]   But that taxonomy is developed through engaging with work.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:21.880]   So what I do is when I read, I draw pictures, and I understand the elements.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.880]   I write in outline form.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:30.640]   Once I learn something, I immediately classify it in my head.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:35.320]   So I always think, ever since reading Adler's book when I was younger, I always think in
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.480]   the four levels of reading.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.560]   And I think at what level am I actually reading right now?
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:44.760]   And I mentally classify from now on all reading in that way.
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.460]   And then I always have that breakdown.
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:51.280]   And although I don't often remember everything, I remember where to go to get the breakdown.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.600]   So I know inspectional reading has two types.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.040]   I can immediately go to the book.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.400]   I have it listed there in outline form.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.480]   These are the two types of inspectional reading, et cetera.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:06.600]   Make your notes that help your brain to work the way that your brain works.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   Let's talk about systematic skimming or pre-reading.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.380]   Let us return to the basic situation to which we've referred before.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:16.760]   There is a book or other reading matter, and here is your mind.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:18.680]   What is the first thing that you do?
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.160]   Let us assume two further elements in the situation, elements that are quite common.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.860]   First, you do not know whether you want to read the book.
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:29.280]   You do not know whether it deserves an analytical reading, but you suspect that it does, or
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:33.880]   at least that it contains both information and insights that would be valuable to you
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.600]   if you could dig them out.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:40.480]   Second, let us assume, and this is very often the case, that you have only a limited time
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.160]   in which to find all this out.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:48.360]   In this case, what you must do is skim the book, or as some prefer to say, pre-read it.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:52.200]   Skimming or pre-reading is the first sub-level of inspectional reading.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:57.000]   Your main aim is to discover whether the book requires a more careful reading.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.080]   Secondly, skimming can tell you lots of other things about the book, even if you decide
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:03.760]   not to read it again with more care.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:08.560]   Giving a book this kind of quick once-over is a threshing process that helps you to separate
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.540]   the chaff from the real kernels of nourishment.
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:15.120]   You may discover that what you get from skimming is all the book is worth to you for the time
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.120]   being.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.660]   It may never be worth more.
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:22.160]   But you will know at least what the author's main contention is, as well as what kind of
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.880]   book he has written, so the time you have spent looking through the book will not have
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:26.880]   been wasted.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.360]   I'm going to pause here to insert my commentary on this idea.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:35.960]   When you're reading syntopically on something that's very important to your area of skill
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:40.640]   development and advancement, skimming is an incredibly important tool, and you should
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:45.760]   not feel the burden to need to read analytically all the books that you buy.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.240]   I don't.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:54.880]   What I do is I get any book that's related to my major core areas of focus.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.400]   I don't think twice about it.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.760]   I don't count the cost.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.640]   I simply get the book.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:04.360]   If it's related to my core areas of interest, my core goals, my wealth goals, my health
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:07.840]   goals, my personal goals, my family goals, I don't think twice.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.080]   I buy the book.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.520]   And this is most important for me in the topic of financial planning.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.640]   I buy almost all the books that I come across in the topic of financial planning that pique
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:23.520]   my interest, because the cost of actually purchasing those books as compared to the
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:29.440]   benefit is just utterly insignificant compared to the benefit.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:32.800]   But I don't read all of those books analytically.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.560]   There's no reason for me to.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:39.480]   What I do is I read it in a skimming fashion so that I know the points that are in it so
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:44.040]   that it's cataloged in my brain.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.880]   Case in point.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:49.440]   Last week I read a book on Roth IRAs.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:55.560]   And the two, I stumbled across the book on Amazon, was talking about, was looking around
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:59.240]   on Amazon, looking at all of the financial books, et cetera, seeing what Amazon popped
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:03.320]   up for me, browsing to see what was available.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.440]   And I stumbled across a title on Roth IRAs.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.840]   The title of that book was called Roths for the Rich, How to Fund Your Roth with Over
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.520]   $100,000 Each Year.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:17.180]   Well, of course, with that title, I immediately think, I think I know how this guy's going
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.840]   to do it.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.000]   But I'm not sure, so I bought the book.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.080]   I just bought it and immediately.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:28.600]   Now when I skim that book, I have a deep knowledge of Roth IRAs, but I'm only looking for the
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.280]   question to one answer.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.720]   I'm looking to know the answer of how did he get $100,000 in there and is there something
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:41.120]   that I can use to, is there something that I can use that I don't know about?
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.880]   Is there a key thing that I don't know about?
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:51.240]   While I'm skimming the book, I stumbled across one other idea that I had not previously thought
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:57.160]   about and it made me question my previous opinions on Roth IRAs.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.320]   But I didn't read the whole book.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.640]   The only two things that I needed to know from that book was number one, the new idea
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:10.520]   that I stumbled across, and number two, how did he get $100,000 into the Roth IRA?
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.680]   I didn't read the book analytically and I don't need to read the book analytically.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.120]   Now that I know the two ideas in that book, it's pigeonholed in my head what the book
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.840]   contains and I'll just simply keep it in my library as a reference book.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.960]   So the next time that I read, sorry, the next time I write or speak on the topic of Roth
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.480]   IRAs, I have it as a reference book.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.200]   And if I have a question on Roth IRAs that relates to either of those two concepts, I
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.960]   know where to go to get the answer.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.560]   I spent seven, eight minutes on the book, read it, done.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.440]   It's categorized, it's pigeonholed.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.600]   It's all I need from the book.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.440]   And so that's one of the key values is as you develop it, you know what the author's
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.520]   point is and if it fits into that nice little cubbyhole in your brain, you know where it
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.840]   is, you know you can go and get it and you can access the information whenever you need
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   it.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.760]   So it's entirely fine to read on that level as you advance in your career.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   Now you can't read on that level in everything.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.900]   That would be silly.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.840]   But you can read on that level in the things that are important to you.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.720]   Now continuing on with how to actually skim the book.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.120]   The habit of skimming should not take much time to acquire.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.360]   Here are some suggestions about how to do it.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.640]   One, look at the title page and if the book has one, add its preface.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.000]   Read each quickly.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.920]   Note especially the subtitles or other indications of the scope or aim of the book or of the
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.720]   author's special angle on his subject.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.980]   Before completing this step, you should have a good idea of the subject and if you wish,
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:41.280]   you may pause for a moment to place the book in the appropriate category in your mind.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:46.240]   What pigeonhole that already contains other books does this one belong in?
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:51.080]   Two, study the table of contents to obtain a general sense of the book's structure.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.080]   Use it as you would a road map before taking a trip.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.840]   It is astonishing how many people never even glance at a book's table of contents unless
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.780]   they wish to look something up in it.
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:04.320]   In fact, many authors spend a considerable amount of time in creating the table of contents
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.160]   and it is sad to think their efforts are often wasted.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:12.840]   It used to be a common practice, especially in expository works, but sometimes even in
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:18.360]   novels and poems, to write very full tables of contents, with the chapters or parts broken
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.680]   down into many subtitles indicative of the topics covered.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:27.280]   Milton, for example, wrote more or less lengthy headings, or arguments as he called them,
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.480]   for each book of Paradise Lost.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.700]   Gibbon published his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire with an extensive analytical
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:36.160]   table of contents for each chapter.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.880]   Such summaries are no longer common, although occasionally you do still come across an analytical
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.240]   table of contents.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.440]   One reason for the decline of the practice may be that people are not so likely to read
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.960]   tables of contents as they once were.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:56.040]   Also, publishers have come to feel that a less revealing table of contents is more seductive
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.320]   than a completely frank and open one.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.480]   Publishers they feel will be attracted to a book with more or less mysterious chapter
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.480]   titles.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.660]   They will want to read the book to find out what the chapters are about.
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.960]   Even so, a table of contents can be valuable and you should read it carefully before going
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.780]   on to the rest of the book.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:18.000]   At this point you might turn back to the table of contents of this book if you have not already
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   read it.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.280]   We tried to make it as full and informative as we could.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:25.200]   Examining it should give you a good idea of what we are trying to do.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.200]   3.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.360]   Check the index if the book has one.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.400]   Most expository works do.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.480]   Make a quick estimate of the range of topics covered and of the kinds of books and authors
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.800]   referred to.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:42.140]   When you see terms listed that seem crucial, look up at least some of the passages cited.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:46.320]   The passages you read may contain the crux, the point on which the book hinges, or the
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.160]   new departure which is the key to the author's approach and attitude.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.320]   As in the case of the table of contents, you might at this point check the index of this
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   book.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.180]   You will recognize as crucial some terms that have already been discussed.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:01.880]   Can you identify, for example, by the number of references under them any others that also
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.440]   seem important?
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.720]   4.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.200]   If the book is a new one with a dust jacket, read the publisher's blurb.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.920]   Some people have the impression that the blurb is never anything but sheer puffery.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.280]   But this is quite often not true, especially in the case of expository works.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.960]   The blurbs of many of these books are written by the authors themselves, admittedly with
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.840]   the help of the publisher's public relations department.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.680]   It is not uncommon for authors to try to summarize as accurately as they can the main points
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:28.880]   in their book.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.740]   These efforts should not go unnoticed.
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:35.280]   Of course, if the blurb is nothing but a puff for the book, you will ordinarily be able
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.080]   to discover this at a glance.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.720]   But that in itself can tell you something about the work.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.800]   Perhaps the book does not say anything of importance, and that is why the blurb does
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.600]   not say anything either.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.000]   Upon completing these first four steps, you may already have enough information about
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.120]   the book to know that you want to read it more carefully, or that you do not want or
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.800]   need to read it at all.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.960]   In either case, you may put it aside for the moment.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:00.080]   If you do not do so, you are now ready to skim the book properly speaking.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.220]   5.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:06.240]   From your general and still rather vague knowledge of the book's contents, look now at the chapters
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.000]   that seem to be pivotal to its argument.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.880]   If these chapters have summary statements in their opening or closing pages, as they
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.720]   often do, read these statements carefully.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.280]   6.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:23.360]   Finally turn the pages, dipping in here and there, reading a paragraph or two, sometimes
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.560]   several pages in sequence.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560]   Never more than that.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.560]   7.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:32.400]   Thumb through the book in this way, always looking for signs of the main contention,
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.160]   listening for the basic pulse beat of the matter.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.400]   Above all, do not fail to read the last two or three pages, or, if these are an epilogue,
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.280]   the last few pages of the main part of the book.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280]   8.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:48.200]   Few authors are able to resist the temptation to sum up what they think is new and important
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.360]   about their work in these pages.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.900]   You do not want to miss this.
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:57.960]   Even though, as sometimes happens, the author himself may be wrong in his judgments.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:03.400]   So that's how you basically skim or pre-read a book.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:08.560]   If you're interested in more, go and buy and read Mortimer Adler's book called How to Read
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.640]   a Book.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:13.600]   But when you pre-read a book, you can get an idea of the basic concepts, and you can
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.680]   see if this book is worth your further reading.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.160]   That's the basic goal.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:27.200]   There are only a small percentage of books that are worth your reading cover to cover.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.940]   Only a small number.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.780]   Those books are the ones that are going to make the most impact in your skill development
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.500]   towards your goals.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.720]   And they're books that are going to be clearly written, and often what I find is they're
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.540]   books that are going to be filled with lots and lots of introspection or lots of important
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:44.300]   ideas.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:52.020]   Just because a book is not worth reading analytically, that doesn't mean it's not worth reading at
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:53.020]   all.
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:55.980]   That's one of the key things that I've always struggled to say to somebody, "What book should
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.980]   you read?"
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.320]   Because usually it's not a book.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.880]   It's usually these seven books, or these three books.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.300]   And yet I can't do that without context.
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.260]   You make a book reading list of 200 books.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.260]   How do you do that?
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:10.920]   I've got 2,200 books in my library, so what do you do?
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:16.380]   What I find is that even when I inspection, even when I skim a book, it usually will spark
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:19.880]   ideas that will then go off of other ideas.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:25.660]   So let's assume now that in pre-reading the book, you have decided that this book is worth
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.920]   actually reading on an analytical level.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.920]   What do you do?
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.800]   Well, after pre-reading it, you have an idea of what's in the book, and now you're equipped
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:37.200]   to go and start from the beginning and read it in the order that the author intends you
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.720]   to read it.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:43.840]   And in this case, the most important thing is to start dealing with the author's ideas.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.920]   So I do that with a pen.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.920]   Here we come to marginalia.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:53.200]   Marginalia is simply the term that refers to a reader's margin notes, how you interact
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.200]   with the book.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.880]   And the important thing, although many of us enjoy looking at other people's marginalia
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.240]   to understand how they do it, the important thing is for you to figure out your own system.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.480]   So I'll give you a few highlights of what I do, but it doesn't really matter what I
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.480]   do.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.480]   What matters is what you do.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:14.520]   The first thing is I personally am very prone to extensive highlighting and extensive underlining,
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:18.320]   which means that I read, when I read analytically, I read very slowly.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.380]   Not that I form the words slowly, but I engage with the concepts.
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:26.340]   So I'll do something where, especially if it's a good book, it's one that's worth reading
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:31.160]   on a deep level, I'll often read a page and then I'll frequently highlight two-thirds
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.160]   of the page.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.380]   But while I'm highlighting it, I'm re-reading it and really thinking about the concept.
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:39.720]   So I'll linger on a page for several minutes while really engaging with it.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.760]   Because once I've engaged with it once, I don't usually need to ever engage with it
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.760]   again.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:51.160]   The reason that I note and do extensive highlighting and underlining is so, first, to give me time
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.080]   to think about it, and also so that if I need to come back in the book in the future, I
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.760]   can pick it up and in just a couple of minutes refresh all of the ideas.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:04.840]   If I grasp a book that I have read extensively, that I've highlighted, that I've marked, I
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:09.320]   can grab it for about three or four minutes, look at it, and then all of the ideas quickly
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.400]   come back to the forefront of my mind.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.080]   I don't need to go back and look through it again.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.700]   I just need to look at my highlights and I've grasped all the important points.
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:20.720]   So that's one of my goals in highlighting and underlining.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.340]   I'll do a couple different things.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:26.040]   So when I used to highlight everything, I would highlight extensively because highlighting
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.240]   was simple and allowed me to read things.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.640]   Since I've stopped highlighting because I now know that I'm probably going to wind up
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:37.600]   scanning the book after I'm done with it, then I've switched to just simply underlining
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.400]   and I underline a few sentences here and there.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.560]   Always use a ruler and then make sure that it's nice and neat.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.480]   Or I will make notes on the side.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.760]   I'll put a bracket on the side of an important paragraph.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:50.360]   I'll star an important paragraph.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.540]   That's one of the things that I do in my personal system of marginalia.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.600]   Another thing that I do is I outline the book while I'm reading it.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:04.640]   If the author writes one, two, and three and I'm in a section where it's numbered, I'll
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.520]   go ahead and I'll either just circle the one, two, three or I'll write my own one, two,
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.520]   three.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.520]   So that way I can come back and I see one, two, three.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.680]   Here are the three points.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.200]   And if the one, two, three are mixed up in a lot of words, then I'll just underline the
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:22.060]   key thing and at the bottom of the page I'll write one, two, three and then the key points.
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:28.280]   Because what I'm looking for is to have the ideas classified in my head.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.880]   So that's one of the keys.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:33.840]   I'm not always reading to actions, although that's an important component of reading.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.400]   Often I'm reading to ideas.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.480]   And so I need those ideas to be classified in my head.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:43.160]   So the act of noticing the author's outline and then reproducing my version of the author's
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:48.960]   outline helps me to stick those ideas in my head so that I can then articulate them to
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.480]   somebody else in the future.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.240]   I can then teach them to somebody else or I can always have this as a framework to go
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.660]   back to.
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:12:00.080]   When I think about ideas, I'm always thinking about principles and frameworks.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.880]   Do we have a good principle to start from and do we have a framework that works?
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.880]   And then I go and take that principle and framework, apply it to the world, notice where
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.480]   it works, notice where it doesn't work.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.320]   And if it doesn't work, come back and say, "Well, can we upgrade the framework in some
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.320]   way?"
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:19.160]   And to me that seems a much better way to live, to start with a framework of ideas and
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.720]   see if that framework holds true as it's tested by evidence than to start with nothing and
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.280]   always just say, "Oh, whatever.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.460]   Hey, whatever goes, man."
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:31.840]   So those frameworks come from putting things together over time.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.880]   Next, if I disagree with the author, I will go ahead and argue with them in the text.
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.720]   One of the most important things when you're having a conversation with the author is to
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:43.460]   make it a two-way conversation.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.140]   You need to write that in the book.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.440]   You need to write whatever it is.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:56.800]   Sometimes my notes are about things I need to pay attention to.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:03.100]   I just randomly as I'm sitting here looking at my copy of Adler's books, sitting here
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.120]   on my screen as I record this, I'll just give you an example.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:10.480]   On page 24, there's a section called "Stages of Learning to Read" and there's this paragraph
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.480]   here.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:17.080]   "General reading readiness is assessed," talking about teaching language and reading to children.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.720]   "General reading readiness is assessed by tests and is also estimated by teachers who
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:26.560]   are often skilled at discerning just when a pupil is ready to learn to read."
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.720]   Then this sentence is, or this next section is underlined.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:31.880]   I'll tell you when I stop.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:38.080]   "The important thing to remember is that jumping the gun is usually self-defeating.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.600]   The child who is not yet ready to read is frustrated if attempts are made to teach him,
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.680]   and he may carry over his dislike for the experience into his later school career and
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.080]   even into adult life.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:56.360]   Delaying the beginning of reading instruction beyond the reading readiness stage is not
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:00.720]   nearly so serious," here I stopped underlining, but I'll finish the sentence, "despite the
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.040]   feelings of parents who may fear that their child is backward or is not keeping up with
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040]   his peers."
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.080]   Then I have all that underlined, then a big note next to it.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.320]   I need to pay attention to this.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:17.000]   The reason is because given my personality and given my desire for my children to succeed
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.280]   and given how important reading is to me, it's very obvious that I could become an overbearing
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:28.400]   parent and I could try to push my children into something that I want them to experience,
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.280]   which has been very helpful to me, but I might push them before they're ready.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:36.400]   Noticing that that's a big danger zone, I have it underlined in a big note.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.920]   I need to pay attention to this, exclamation point.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.040]   I don't want to make that mistake.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.560]   That's my way of saying, "hey, this applies to me.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.560]   This hurts.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.320]   This is a really, really big deal."
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:52.440]   I'll give you another example where I ask myself questions to engage with the author.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:58.960]   On page 28, I see the author says, "this of course should not be the case," talking about
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.860]   higher levels of reading and higher education and has been making a point about reading
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.080]   in schools.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.800]   So I underlined this paragraph.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.400]   "This of course should not be the case.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.800]   A good liberal arts high school, if it does nothing else, ought to produce graduates who
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.880]   are competent analytical readers.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:19.640]   A good college, if it does nothing else, ought to produce competent syntopical readers.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.640]   A college degree ought to represent general competence in reading such that a graduate
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.940]   could read any kind of material for general readers and be able to undertake independent
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:32.400]   research on almost any subject, for that is what syntopical reading, among other things,
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.200]   enables you to do.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.120]   Often however," and I ended my underlining there, "often however, three or four years
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:42.520]   of graduate study are required before students attain this level of reading ability, and
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:45.200]   they do not always attain it even then."
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.200]   And so I have beside that sentence a big star, and I have, "home education goals?
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.240]   Is this a proper and worthy goal?"
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.600]   Meaning that of course I'm thinking about my children.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.760]   I want my children to have very high quality educations.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:01.460]   I want them to understand, so is this my goal?
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:06.880]   Is this an appropriate goal for me to have when I'm laying out their curriculum for their
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.880]   studies?
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:11.080]   So those are some examples of my things to do.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.960]   Now once you get past that, let me focus now on actions.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:20.100]   The next piece of marginalia, and this is not in a book like, necessarily in this kind
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.880]   of book, but in the kind of books that you'll probably be reading for your goals, it's important
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:29.160]   that you focus on actions that you can take, because only action is ultimately going to
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.300]   change something for you.
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.320]   You can set a goal.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.320]   That's good.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:34.320]   Right?
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.800]   That's automatically going to start moving you in directions because of the actions you'll
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.120]   take based upon having that goal.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.940]   Once you set a goal, you make a plan.
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:43.880]   That's good, but you still haven't done anything when you made a plan.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.840]   Then you said, "What skills do I need to develop?"
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:46.840]   Good.
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.320]   So then you took the action of buying a book, but now in order for you to work all the way
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.980]   back to that goal achievement, you have to put into action something specific to help
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:57.520]   you learn the skill.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.840]   And so one of the things I'm always looking for is what action do I need to take based
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.320]   upon what I am reading.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.220]   So I use when I'm reading simple check boxes, and I write a little square box, a check box
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:12.100]   next to something when I say, "This is something the author is saying.
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.120]   This is something I need to do."
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.220]   Sometimes it's a book I need to read.
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:18.600]   The author alludes to this certain book, and I say, "You know what?
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.200]   For my goals, I need that book."
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.200]   I put a little check box next to it.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.000]   And then what I do is I put an index in the back of the book or the front, doesn't matter,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.920]   and I go to the back of the book or the front of the book, and I write a little check box,
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.080]   and I write, "Page 53, by the Secrets of Success."
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.020]   I don't know if that's a book name, but by this book.
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.520]   And then I put a check box next to it.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:47.040]   Or if they have a website to visit, I put a little check box, make a list, check, check,
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.760]   check, all the things I need to do.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.600]   Or do this journaling exercise.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.320]   I go ahead and put a check box next to it.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.320]   And I'm creating an action list for myself based upon what I'm reading.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.520]   Because the only way I'm going to build that skill is to actually do it.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:03.160]   So I'm engaging with it, and I'm building that action list.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.080]   That way, when I arrive at the end of the book, I have my to-do list right there at
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.400]   the beginning of the book.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.320]   Now, once I arrive at the end of the book, I go through those things, I see what seems
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.320]   relevant.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.080]   If something doesn't seem relevant, just cross it off.
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:16.240]   "No, I'm not going to do that.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.600]   I don't need to read Secrets of Success, whatever."
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:24.680]   But if something does seem relevant, then now it goes on to my action list for my other
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.960]   task management list.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.840]   And it comes from the book.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.400]   And then as I do it, I check it off and go from there.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.960]   That's a really important thing to do.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.000]   Another thing that I do, and that's probably the most crucial thing, is to make sure you're
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   taking action.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.960]   So if it's a book on investing, and the author's telling you how to become an investment, then
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:41.960]   lay it out.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:42.960]   Lay out how to do it.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:48.240]   I will also often reproduce, depending on the book, reproduce some of the basic concepts
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:53.120]   or action lists or outlines of the book into the front or back cover, so that I can really
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:58.560]   have an idea of how to do this going forward.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:06.400]   So in my copy of Adler's book, the most important topics for me, which were the levels of reading,
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.740]   are right there inside the front cover.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:12.840]   If it's a more action-oriented book about follow this process for learning how to be
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.820]   a successful real estate investor, I'll write my action plan right there.
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:21.080]   If I've set a goal as a result of the book, maybe I read John Shobbs, Building Wealth
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.240]   One House at a Time, and I just said, "You know what?
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.520]   I can grab the idea of buying a house every year."
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:29.900]   So I write to the front, "My goal is to buy a house every single year for this number
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:34.000]   of years at this value with these levels of rents to build this certain financial freedom
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   plan."
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   And I lay it out there.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.520]   It's one of the reasons why I don't ever like anyone to look at my books.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.640]   I get very nervous about somebody seeing my books, because they're very personal.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.640]   I've made myself vulnerable.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.780]   So another reason why you never lend your books out.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:49.780]   I've made myself vulnerable.
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:52.600]   I've argued with them, with the book.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.600]   And especially when you're reading in things that are, it's one thing if you're reading,
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.080]   well, a book like Adler's book, I don't care.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:02.060]   I've published that on the internet of my books, because it's not personal to me.
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:06.320]   But if I'm reading a book on money, and I'm setting financial goals, I might not yet have
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:11.440]   the confidence to say to somebody that I've set a goal of earning a million dollars a
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.440]   year, right?
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.440]   You set a goal.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.520]   I'm going to earn a million dollars a year, but you're earning $40,000 a year.
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.880]   You don't know how you're going to do that.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.640]   And most of your friends, when you're earning $40,000 a year, most of your friends will
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:21.400]   laugh at you if you tell them you're earning a million dollars a year.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.400]   So you don't ever tell anybody about your goals to earn a million dollars a year when
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.440]   you're surrounded by people who are earning $40,000 per year.
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.480]   Yeah, when you're talking with people who are earning a million dollars a year, it's
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.840]   fine to share those goals.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.600]   But you don't do that when you're earning $40,000 a year, because they'll ridicule you.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.600]   They'll laugh at you.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.240]   They'll try to pull you back down to their level.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.780]   But you can write it in your books.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:39.780]   You can engage with that.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:40.960]   But I wouldn't want someone to know that.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.760]   So I'm pretty sensitive about people seeing my books, which is another benefit of having
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.560]   them scanned in terms of privacy of the ideas.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.880]   There are also books that you read where you're really wrestling with a topic.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.880]   Maybe you're reading a book on weight loss, and you're fat.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:59.560]   And you're just wrestling with the psychology of it.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:03.040]   And you take a moment, and you pour out your heart on the back page.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.480]   You're like, "Why am I so fat?
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.600]   Why is it that nothing works?
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.360]   I don't actually believe this guy, that he knows what it's like, etc."
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.240]   Well, that stuff's really personal.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.480]   Or maybe you're wrestling with a spiritual crisis, and you're thinking to yourself, "I
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.960]   don't know if I believe in God.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   I'm not sure."
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:23.680]   And you're reading a book, and my note in the margin is, "I don't know if I actually
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680]   believe in God."
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.840]   And all of a sudden, that would be the kind of thing where you don't need to talk about
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:28.840]   that to everybody.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:32.280]   You just choose carefully the people that you talk to.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:36.320]   And so when you're dealing with some aspect of your theology, or your worldview, or your
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.400]   politics, and you're reading a book that you disagree with politically, but you write,
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.400]   "Good point.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.800]   This guy's got a good point."
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.880]   So I get nervous about being exposed like that until I've had time to really think something
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:48.880]   through.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.600]   But I do engage with them in that way.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:58.000]   Next thing that I do when I'm reading is I always focus on the vocabulary that I am learning
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.280]   from a book.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.520]   Back to that skill of reading.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:04.120]   One of the skills of reading that you need to develop is learning vocabulary.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:08.360]   And if you're not reading books that stretch your vocabulary, you're probably not being
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.360]   stretched intellectually.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:15.520]   And this is where, I don't know whether it's good or bad, I try not to assign judgment
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:21.320]   on things that don't have to be judged, but we certainly have regressed in the level of
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:25.640]   vocabulary that we use in the written word.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:30.240]   If you go back and you read a book, you read Adler's book, or you read a book from 50 years
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.520]   ago, you'll find all kinds of words that you don't know today.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.520]   And it'll expand your vocabulary.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.840]   And when I read old books that were intended for lay audiences, oftentimes I'm just sitting
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.200]   there puzzling with a dictionary.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.560]   Now is this a good thing or a bad thing?
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:48.320]   The good thing about writing with a simpler vocabulary in the modern world is perhaps
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.080]   you can reach more people.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:54.960]   One of the key things that people who write sales copy professionally, copywriters, try
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.480]   to focus on is always keeping their language very simple.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.680]   They don't generally ever want to be past the fifth grade level.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:07.280]   Interestingly, how I saw this work out in politics was during the 2016 presidential
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:14.120]   election, I read a piece of analysis and it was talking about then candidate Donald Trump,
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.960]   how simplistically he spoke.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:23.280]   The simple, elementary, juvenile, ignorant, was what the author criticized, level of speech
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:26.360]   that he as a political candidate was employing.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.240]   And I thought to myself, you know what?
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:33.480]   And then after President Trump won the election, I thought that is exactly one of the reasons
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:38.040]   that he won, is especially if you understand that the copywriters will take their copy,
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:42.400]   they'll run it through an automated program which will assign a grade level.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:47.000]   And if they find that there is something past grade five, they go back, they strip out complex
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.560]   words, they make things simpler, shorter, etc. to cut down the grade level.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:54.480]   And so the same thing applies from the level of political candidate.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.280]   The challenge I've always had is do I do that?
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:03.440]   Do I speak with a small vocabulary, small words, etc.?
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.840]   Or do I enjoy the richness of the English language?
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:13.120]   Do I enjoy the richness of intellectual ideas and learning how to weave those ideas together
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:22.160]   in a tapestry that not only indicates meaning but also conveys beauty?
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:26.800]   Sentence that I've just created there is a complex sentence with a metaphor, a visual
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.680]   metaphor and complex words.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.140]   And yet that's what I like.
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:37.640]   And so I want to read books that expand that and I want to be careful depending on the
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:47.940]   context to use simpler words, simpler grammar, more elementary syntax when I'm in those contexts.
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.760]   But I still want to read reading at a level that stretches me out.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:54.400]   And so when I'm reading books, I want to be reading and learning new vocabulary.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.920]   So whenever I find a word that I don't know or a word that I think I know but you know
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:03.280]   it's been a long time since I've looked that up, then I always circle it and then I write
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:07.040]   at the top of the page, I write the word and the definition.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.480]   I write the word and the definition right away.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.800]   I used to not do that because I used to have to go and look up a word in a dictionary.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:19.720]   But since the advent of online dictionaries, especially the dictionary that's available
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:24.400]   through a digital device which is probably sitting right next to me, now I have a wonderful
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.880]   ability to just simply look up the word right away.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.480]   And so it's super easy to do that.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.280]   So as an example on page 98 of How to Read a Book, Adler writes this sentence.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:37.800]   He says, "If language were a pure and perfect medium for thought, these steps would not
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.500]   be separate.
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:45.280]   If every word had only one meaning, if words could not be used ambiguously, if in short
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.840]   each word was an ideal term, language would be a diaphanous medium."
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:53.440]   I don't know what the word diaphanous is.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:58.760]   So I circled it, diaphanous, looked it up and wrote at the top of the page, diaphanous,
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:04.400]   very sheer and light, almost completely transparent or translucent.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.440]   So now I know what he's talking about.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:12.480]   Meaning would be clearer, language would be a diaphanous medium, a more clear medium,
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:15.960]   a more able to be understood more easily.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.360]   So then what I do is I write the word at the beginning of the book.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.120]   So I have on the front page, new vocabulary and then a list whenever I learn a new word,
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.160]   I write it at the front of the book.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:31.600]   So that way I can refer to the book and find all of those new vocabulary words.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:38.560]   So my list at the beginning of How to Read a Book, vocabulary, desideratum, page X,
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:47.000]   abecedarian, page XI, carp, page XXIX, interstitial, page XXXIX, perspicuous, page XXIV, oratory,
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:54.680]   page XXIV, oratorical, chronotopic, individuous, diaphanous, verbalism, tautology, ledger domain,
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:59.000]   inveterate, sine qua non, admixture, buskin, oblation.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.840]   Those are my vocabulary words from this particular book.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:06.760]   Not all of them were words that I necessarily didn't know.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.800]   For example, the word carp, I mean, a carp on somebody.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.600]   I knew the word, but I wanted to just make sure that I understood the full context.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.200]   And so whenever I even do that, I want to make sure that I learn it.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.160]   And then ideally, I would love to tell you that I put those words into a study system
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.160]   of some kind.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.880]   And every day I wake up and I study my vocabulary cards.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.880]   I don't.
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.200]   I should.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.520]   Maybe I'll add that at some point in the future.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   I don't.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.120]   Usually though, once I see them once, I'm pretty good to go.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:38.560]   And then the challenge is it's just not always worth memorizing all that stuff because unfortunately
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:45.000]   in today's world, there's not, when you use complex vocabulary, people think you're showing
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.300]   off instead of, unless you're with a very select group of friends where you would actually
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:50.300]   speak like that.
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:54.640]   I mean, the word desideratum, the sentence was, however, certain things have not changed
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:55.860]   in the last 30 years.
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:28:02.080]   One constant is that to achieve all the purposes of reading, the desideratum must be the ability
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.640]   to read different things at different appropriate speeds, not everything at the greatest possible
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.640]   speed.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:12.800]   So desideratum means something wanted or needed, but I can't imagine the context where I could
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.480]   use that word without being laughed out of the room.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.920]   So why bother to learn it?
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.400]   It doesn't really make any sense.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:25.880]   It's unfortunately, that kind of environment is a bygone era and anybody, if I ever use
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:27.280]   that word, nobody would understand it.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:30.480]   And then you've basically taken away the whole use of language when nobody understands it.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:40.320]   So we're going to regress to a fifth grade level of speech in all of our interactions
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.520]   and I've basically resigned myself to that.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:47.000]   A couple of more things and then we will be done for today.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.580]   Vocabulary building, we've talked about.
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:50.880]   One thing you can do is dog ear the pages.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.200]   If you are looking to, you think about how you want to have the book.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:58.400]   If you're looking to have the book and it be a reference manual for you, you can consider
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.520]   just dog earing the third of your pages or whatever that you want to refer to.
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:02.840]   Some people use post-it notes.
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.280]   I have sometimes dog eared pages.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:08.800]   The problem is now that I've taken to scanning the books, I don't do that.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.680]   A lot of times if there's a page that has a really important point or idea, I'll put
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.840]   a big star at the top, etc.
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.400]   So exclamation points, underlines, squiggly lines, lots of writing.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.920]   You develop your own system of symbols, etc.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:24.720]   But you do want to engage with the book.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.000]   Second to last final step, follow the references.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.960]   One of the most important things to do is follow the references.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:35.160]   And here you follow the bibliography and you follow the books that were written.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:39.480]   And this is how you start to gain comprehensive knowledge in a subject.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:43.760]   When you read a book, a well-written book, notice you've probably culled out nine books
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.880]   to choose this one book to read.
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:51.120]   But a well-written book is going to reference and allude to other books, which you will
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:57.960]   probably need to go ahead and get or find a summary or some way to engage with those
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:58.960]   books.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:03.880]   So you study the bibliography and in general most books that are worth reading will stimulate
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:09.440]   you to read three or four or five other books, which is one area where this process is ultimately
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.800]   unsustainable.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.080]   If every book you read inspires you to read five other books and you get those five books
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:18.580]   and of course those five books all inspire you to read five other books, you're quickly
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:24.160]   at a point of unsustainability, which is why those of us who are readers have houses full
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.480]   of books that we've never read.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:30.360]   We will never read and yet we feel a little bit guilty about having bought them and not
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:31.360]   read them.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:32.360]   I've given up the guilt.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:37.040]   I realize that the fact that I know a book is on my shelf and I know what's in it, even
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.560]   just with a quick skim, is enough.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.200]   I know if I'm in that situation where I can go and get that book.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.440]   And I go back in my head and I find that idea and sometimes I'll just go and pick a book
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.360]   up because I want to read in a certain topic for a little bit.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:53.600]   Not going to become deeply knowledgeable in that area, just want to read in it for a little
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.600]   bit.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:58.360]   I've given up the guilt over buying books that I don't read or that I don't read thoroughly
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.280]   and I think you should too.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:07.400]   But you do want to make sure that you understand what are the books in a certain area that
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.200]   are really influential.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.560]   I've been talking a lot about money and kind of success in the examples I've given you.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:19.840]   I've not talked about philosophy or theology or some of these more less mainstream subjects.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.720]   I've kept it on pertinent examples.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:27.400]   But at the end of the day, you're always going to go back to Napoleon Hill when you're reading
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:28.760]   about success.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.120]   So you'll see Napoleon Hill referenced everywhere.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:35.160]   So you're going to have to go back to Napoleon Hill.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:40.840]   And so when you get there by the bibliography, once you've read Napoleon Hill, what will
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:46.960]   happen is all of the later success literature will just instantly unfold to you.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.640]   And it's just like a cascade where you see, "Oh, this idea is just a restatement of this
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:57.400]   idea and there's this basic core repertoire of these 25 major ideas in this genre and
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:00.160]   everybody's just restating these 25 ideas."
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:04.800]   And then in time, when you do that syntopically on an area that you care about, that's what
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.920]   allows you to then read faster and faster and faster, which is why today when I talk
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:12.720]   about money or I read a money book, that's what I do.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:16.440]   I go to the bookstore, give me 10 money books, give me five minutes with each book and I
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:20.120]   can categorize them all because there are only so many concepts.
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:23.280]   Now the individual stories will be impactful to different people and I'm not denying the
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.440]   power of a new book.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.880]   That's why new books are great.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.000]   Books will grab different people at different times.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.940]   One person will relate to one story, another person will relate to another story.
[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:38.880]   And so that's why it's valuable to have an author write new books on these certain things.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:45.160]   But once you've read the whole slew of early retirement books that have been coming out
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.360]   recently, and I've read a few of them, I should read and review more.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:52.400]   Stuff bores me, which is why I don't do it much.
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:58.840]   But at the end of the day, if you just read early retirement extreme by Fisker, you don't
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:03.680]   need to read any of those other books because Fisker covered the basic concepts, he laid
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:08.940]   out the math and he described the vocabulary of it.
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:18.240]   And now everything after that is just simply permutations on an idea, reworking through
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.240]   things etc.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:24.380]   Now that's not to say that individuals can't add certain things to it.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.880]   That's why you still read the books, you still have an idea because you're looking as they're
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:27.880]   a unique flavor.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.940]   And it's not to say there won't be individual applications to it.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:34.520]   So somebody can take and write a book on how to become financially independent with real
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:38.040]   estate, somebody can write how to become financially independent with stocks etc.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:45.760]   But once you've grasped the basic ideas, then you don't need to read carefully every single
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:52.960]   book because it's just going to be a repackaging of the core ideas of the field.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:56.220]   And so that's where you get to and you should have a goal of getting to that.
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:01.720]   You get there by following the bibliography and following the references.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:07.960]   In my approach to reading, I don't think there's one book that's going to answer all your questions.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:15.120]   I think there are very few categories of things to read in that are going to bring a major
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:17.360]   change to your life.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.840]   It's actually a very short list.
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:23.480]   It's not that much.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:28.160]   Most people will have goals related to their business, their career.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.480]   Most people have some goals related to their finances.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:37.200]   Most people will have some goals related to their family or relationships.
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:41.560]   Most people have some goals related to their physical health, their fitness.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.680]   And most people have some goals related to their spiritual experience, their spiritual
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:49.280]   life or their intellectual life.
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.060]   That's really about it.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:57.160]   And so in those key areas, there are only some basic applications that you do.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.120]   Now the most interesting one to me is business and career and finance.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:05.560]   But that's the areas that are most extensive in terms of things you look at.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.200]   I guess we could talk about philosophy and spirituality is extremely extensive as well.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:16.360]   But once you master some of those basic subjects, you don't have to keep on going, keep on going.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.400]   But most likely don't expect any one book to solve all of your answers.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:25.380]   Expect to read some good books and to have those stimulate other books.
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:29.020]   But expect that in time you can't just read one book.
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:31.920]   What you'll probably do is read all the books.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:37.640]   And so I've created a list of books to start with, which I'll tell you how to get that
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.040]   list in just a moment.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:45.480]   But don't expect any one book to do anything other than to give you some new ideas.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:50.200]   As you're reading, think about what's written in the book and deal with what's written in
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.200]   the book.
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:55.960]   But don't expect what's written in the book in any one book to change your life.
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.120]   I don't know of any one book that has ever changed my life.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:04.200]   What I do know is that reading all the books has changed my life.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:06.920]   I'm aware that may sound overwhelming to you.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.120]   I get that.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.800]   And I get that in today's world we're supposed to make things sound easy.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.800]   But you know what?
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.760]   I don't think it is easy.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.560]   It's not easy.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:16.840]   But it is doable.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:22.720]   And if you develop the skills little by little and expect to read all the books, in time
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.760]   you'll develop your own application of those things.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:28.960]   There are places for different types of reading.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.980]   And that's where the most important thing is simply to read.
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:37.420]   What I find at this point, one of the most important things for me is to read widely
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:40.760]   rather than deeply in everything.
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:42.360]   So I read widely.
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.440]   And that allows ideas to just rattle off of each other sometimes.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.000]   I read the weirdest books.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.080]   I would be so embarrassed if my reading lists were published to the internet because nobody
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.760]   would understand it except me.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.440]   I read weird books.
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.920]   I read weird books and I usually go for, I read the ones written by the popular ones
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.880]   because I need to, but I usually go for the most esoteric books because often what I find
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:09.240]   is the ideas in them can rattle and bounce off and mate with some of the other ideas
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:13.560]   in my head and allow me to have a unique perspective on something or allow something to really
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.680]   sink in deeply.
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.140]   And I think the same would probably be true for you.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:24.800]   When you read widely, you gain access to different ways of looking at the world.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.760]   And that helps to keep your creativity alive.
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.680]   It helps you to look at things differently.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:33.240]   And what I have noticed is for me, that helps me to be a better financial advisor.
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:40.640]   It helps me to be a better teacher and to have more effective examples that help more
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:42.080]   people.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.680]   And so don't be scared to indulge your esoteric interests.
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.580]   There's value in those things.
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:51.560]   Which brings me to my closing.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:57.680]   If you are now, you're still here, one hour and 38 minutes into this podcast episode,
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:03.440]   you are very deeply interested in improving your life and in learning the skills that
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.800]   you need.
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:10.000]   Reading and these skills that we've talked about today are foundational skills for your
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.220]   success and for your expertise.
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:21.440]   You will not be able to move yourself into a very high income position unless you master
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:26.640]   an area of your career, your business, et cetera.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:27.680]   You won't do it.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:31.460]   The fastest way for you to get there is through reading.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:33.020]   So you've gotten to this point.
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:37.600]   So what I have done is I have created a recommended reading list.
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.400]   And as with all lists, a recommended reading list is not something where you should read
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.000]   every book on the list.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.520]   It's a list where you should read a handful of the books on the list that speak to something
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.000]   that you need right now.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.780]   Filter books based upon how they speak to you right now.
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:57.880]   But if you would like to get Joshua's recommended reading list and you would like to get it
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:03.320]   so that you can understand and have some creative fodder for useful and valuable influences
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:11.880]   that you can invite into your life, teachers, leaders, mentors, et cetera, go to radicalbooklist.com
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.560]   and enter your email address there and I will email you my reading list.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:17.960]   Go to radicalbooklist.com.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:21.920]   Again, radicalbooklist.com.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:26.360]   And this is a selection of books that is very tightly curated.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:30.400]   This is just simply my opinions, but I will tell you about the book, why the book has
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:37.920]   helped and influenced me deeply, and you can then take that book and read it and experience
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:39.280]   a similar transformation.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:43.800]   So in closing today, go to radicalbooklist.com, put your email address there and I will email
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:46.600]   you my recommended reading list.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:51.400]   In addition, if I can get it done in the next hour or two, I will create a short presentation
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:58.600]   where I will walk you through and give you a video of my copy of Adler's book, How to
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.800]   Read a Book, that I've been referencing here on my screen.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:04.280]   So I'll show you it and do a short little presentation on that and send you that video
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:05.280]   as well.
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.720]   So go to radicalbooklist.com to sign up to get a copy of my book list and that short
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:10.720]   presentation.
