[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.080]   Now, I think this is less of a problem than it was in the past, because for all of the downsides of digital consumption, I think the modern person is reading many more words on a daily basis than the average person 50 years ago. You can't flip through your social media streams without reading constantly. And so I think, although I can't prove it, I think there's probably actually an increase in the number of words being read and consumed today,

[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:52.160]   the problem was my choosing to play basketball briefly in high school was
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.880]   that I didn't play basketball before he decided to ever go and play basketball
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:03.080]   in high school and so I went and I tried out for the basketball tryouts and they
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.780]   were shooting layups and to my shame or whatever you can laugh at me I had
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.780]   never shot a layup I didn't know how to shoot a layup here I was at 16 years old
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:40.140]  , 17 years old I was a senior in high school playing basketball my first year and I didn't know how to shoot a layup and so the assistant coach took me to the side of the court and taught me how to shoot a layup now the question is would there have been any use whatsoever in trying to teach the 17 year old Joshua some intricate advanced basketball concept I don't know what those advanced concepts are

You don't have to read all the books you buy. That's the other thing. But you do have to buy the books you're going to really learn from. They need to be yours. Books have never been cheaper than they are today.

[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.740]   and you can have an idea of when you read that book. Now when you go to read, here's what you do. You first need to have the tools of reading. And the tools of reading are most importantly a pen.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:45:22.880]  , a highlighter, a ruler. Now throughout my lifetime what I've always liked is blue pens and yellow highlighters. I like yellow highlighters because they allow you to highlight the things that you want to highlight without being so disruptive to the reading experience like pink and green and blue. I have over the last few years stopped using highlighters and gone exclusively to pens and not to use them. So I'm going to show you how to use them.

[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:45.600]   "How to read a book" is a very common question. Digital books are nice, but they're not so good because they have that problem of linearity. You have to read them from the front to the back. It's hard to scan a digital book. They do have a place, but the best is, especially if you're a beginning reader, start with the physical book. Your first action is to pre-read the book. Now for a pre-reading, I'm going to here refer you briefly to a couple of pages in Mortimer Adler's classic book called "How to Read a Book".
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:14.640]   "How to read a book" is a good book, but it's not, it's very important for academic philosophical books, deeper books, the great books, the great history of ideas, etc. It's not so important for what we're talking about necessarily. It's a good book that you should probably read, but it's beyond what's necessary for most of what we're talking about. But in that book, Adler talks about the different levels of reading.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:14.640]   "How to read a book" is a good book, but it's beyond what's necessary for most of what we're talking about. But in that book, Adler talks about the different levels of reading.

[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:44.680]  , "How to read a book" is a good book, but it's beyond what's necessary for most of what we're talking about. But in that book, Adler talks about the different levels of reading.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:44.680]   I can go right to the levels of reading and I can use his four levels and I've got with my marginalia I have those levels clearly outlined so I can without rereading the book I can immediately know I'm going to talk about these four levels of reading I know right where to go and my system of marginalia which I'll talk to you about in a moment is going to clearly show me what I need so here are the four levels of reading number one the first level of reading number one the first level of reading is called elementary reading
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:55.540]   look

[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.500]   or even a book twice as long.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.220]   Hence, another way to describe this level of reading
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:55.880]   is to say that its aim is to get the most out of a book within a given time,
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:59.920]   usually a relatively short time and always, by definition,
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.020]   too short a time to get out of the book everything that can be gotten.
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.980]   Still, another name for this level might be skimming or pre-reading.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:10.320]   However, we do not mean the kind of skimming that is characterized
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.600]   by casual or random browsing through a book.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.740]   The term skimming is used to describe
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:14.740]   and what we mean by that is that it is a kind of skimming
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:14.740]   that is characterized by casual or random browsing
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:14.740]   through a book.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:14.740]   In fact, this is a kind of skimming that is characterized
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:14.740]   by casual or random browsing through a book.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:14.740]   In fact, this is a kind of skimming that is characterized
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:14.740]   by casual or random browsing through a book.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:32.800]   In fact, this is a kind of skimming that is characterized by casual or random

[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.160]   Now, continuing on with how to actually skim the book.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.960]   The habit of skimming should not take much time to acquire.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.940]   Here are some suggestions about how to do it.
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:23.000]   One, look at the title page and if the book has one, add its preface.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.460]   Read each quickly.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:32.040]   Note especially the subtitles or other indications of the scope or aim of the book or of the author's special angle on his subject.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:39.040]   Before completing this step, you should have a good idea of the subject and, if you wish, you may pause for a moment to place the book in the
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:39.040]   The book is a book that is not intended to be read as a book.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:39.040]   The author's special angle on his subject.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:39.040]   Before completing this step, you should have a good idea of the subject and, if you wish, you may pause for a moment to place the book in the
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:39.040]   The author's special angle on his subject.

[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:12.900]   It used to be a common practice, especially in expository works, but sometimes even in
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:18.400]   novels and poems, to write very full tables of contents, with the chapters or parts broken
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.780]   down into many subtitles indicative of the topics covered.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:26.840]   Milton, for example, wrote more or less lengthy headings, or ï¿½argumentsï¿½ as he called
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.540]   them, for each book of Paradise Lost.
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:33.760]   Gibbon published his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire with an extensive analytical
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.440]   table of contents for each chapter.

[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:57.840]   The book should not go unnoticed. Of course, if the blurb is nothing but a puff for the book, you will ordinarily be able to discover this at a glance. But that, in itself, can tell you something about the work. Perhaps the book does not say anything of importance, and that is why the blurb does not say anything either. Upon completing these first four steps, you may already have enough information about the book to know that you want to read it more carefully, or that you do not want or need to read it at all. In either case, you may put it aside for the moment. If you do not do so, you are now ready to skim the book, properly speaking.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:57.840]   You may also want to skim the book, properly speaking. In either case, you may put it aside for the moment. If you do not do so, you are now ready to skim the book, properly speaking.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:26.120]   from your general and still rather vague knowledge of the book's contents, look now at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to its argument. If these chapters have summary statements in their opening or closing pages, as they often do, read these statements carefully. Finally, turn the pages dipping in here and there, reading a paragraph or two, sometimes several pages in sequence, never more than that. Thumbs through the book in this case, and you will know that the book is not a book, but a book that is written in English.

[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:51.960]   Th's not worth reading analytically.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.380]   I've always struggled to say to somebody, what book should you read?
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:57.980]   Because usually it's not a book.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.180]   It's usually these seven books, right?
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.360]   Or these three books.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.160]   And yet I can't do that without context.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.300]   You make a book reading list of 200 books.
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.320]   How do you do that, right?
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.540]   I've got 2,200 books in my library.
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.280]   So what do you do?
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:19.000]   What I find is that even when I skim a book, it usually will spark ideas that will then go off of other ideas.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.980]   So let's assume now that in pre-reading books, you can read a book that you've read.
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:21.980]   And I've got 2,200 books in my library.
