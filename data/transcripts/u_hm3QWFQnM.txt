[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120]   No doubt because Bernie Sanders is making a serious run for the presidency in the United
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.600]   States, this question is on the minds of some podcast listeners.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.520]   One, a listener named Christian writes in to ask this, "Hello Pastor John, how should
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.320]   Christians view socialism?"
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.600]   What'd you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.580]   Well, I suppose I should put all of my misgivings up front to say I'm no expert in political
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.400]   science or economics, so take it for what it's worth.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.440]   Here we go.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:46.380]   I think the first thing I should say is that the church, the church in the church, no one
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.860]   should go hungry.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.480]   No one should be without a place to stay.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.360]   No one should fail to get the health care they need.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.600]   No one should go without a job if it's possible for believers to help them find one and so
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.920]   on.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:08.480]   And all of this should happen through the free and uncoerced help of other believers.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.880]   When Luke writes in Acts 2, 44, "All who believed were together and had all things
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.460]   in common, and they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.340]   to all as any had need."
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.600]   What he means is that every need was being met by other believers, even if they had to
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.420]   sell things that they owned in order to help meet them, and this was done freely.
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.680]   It didn't remove, but rather presumed the ownership of private property.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.020]   Indeed, all of the Bible, Old and New Testament, assumes both the legitimacy and, I think,
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.140]   necessity of personal ownership.
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:04.220]   Thou shalt not steal makes no sense where no one has a right to keep what is his.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:15.660]   The reason I stress that all of this is uncoerced, free, not forced, is because of the heavy
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:27.200]   emphasis that Paul puts on giving to the poor in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 freely, cheerfully,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   not under compulsion.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.440]   I remember I had a big debate when I was in Germany with a professor and other student
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.360]   because of the way they fund the church, the state church there, through taxes.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.640]   I said, "That just doesn't fit without compulsion, cheerfully and freely."
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.360]   In other words, there is built into the Christian faith an inner impulse by the Holy Spirit
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.920]   through the gospel to make sacrifices so that others have their needs met, and there is
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:05.160]   no such impulse built into human nature or the human heart apart from God's grace.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   And it is so vital that this kind of love and mercy and sacrifice be free and uncoerced
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.640]   that this is laid down as a principle by Paul in 2 Corinthians 9, by Peter in 1 Peter 5,
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.520]   as he's instructing the elders there.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.600]   Now, socialism, as I understand it, I don't know much about it, but socialism, as I understand
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:38.040]   it, refers to a social and economic system that through legal or governmental or military
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.360]   coercion, in other words, you go to jail if you don't do this, establishes social ownership
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:53.640]   at the expense of private or personal ownership, or and/or, you could say, where coercion is
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.360]   used to establish social control, if not ownership, at least control of the means of production
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:10.000]   in society, and thus through control effectively eliminate many of the implications and motivations
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.440]   of private ownership.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.640]   In other words, socialism borrows the compassionate aims of Christianity in meeting people's
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:30.480]   needs while rejecting the Christian expectation that these things will not be coerced or forced.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.260]   Socialism therefore gets its attractiveness at certain points in history where people
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:46.400]   are drawn to the entitlements that socialism brings and where people are ignorant or forgetful
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.200]   of the coercion and the force required to implement it and whether or not that coercion
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:02.920]   might in fact backfire and result in greater poverty or drab uniformity or worse, the abuse
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.720]   of the coercion as we saw in the murderous states like the USSR and in Cambodia.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.680]   It may be that Bernie Sanders is naming things in our society that need addressing.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.840]   I don't doubt that's the case.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.200]   There are no doubt real injustices that make it harder for the poor to move out of poverty
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.220]   and make it easier for the rich to do wrong and get away with it.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:36.580]   But I doubt that holding up Denmark's economic model, which he does, as the way forward is
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.280]   the path of wisdom.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.320]   Forbes, for example, reports that out of a total population of 5.6 million, a little
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.560]   more than 2 million in Denmark, a little more than 2 million are state pensioners, unemployed,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.800]   sick, or on social transfer payments for other reasons, and another 800,000 are employed
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   by the public sector.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.280]   That's half the population employed by the state or sustained by money channeled through
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.760]   the state.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.640]   Or to put it another way, out of 5.6 million people in Denmark, there are only about 1.8
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.440]   million that are not directly dependent on the state for payments of some sort.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:28.760]   And even among this group, there is high focus on cheap, subsidized childcare, free healthcare,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.480]   child bonus payments, subsidized housing, and a large number of other ways to secure
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.920]   additional income from the state.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:48.840]   Just an example, students get five years of free tuition at state universities, and I
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.800]   read of a married student who gets a $900 stipend from the state and free childcare.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.000]   So basically, living totally off the state for those university years.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.140]   Now political liberals, they analyze this all over Europe right now and everybody says
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.840]   these systems are under pressure.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.840]   That's the word that's used by liberals.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.080]   They're under pressure, like most of the entitlement states of Europe.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.000]   Conservatives say it's a ticking time bomb.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.040]   In other words, almost everybody says it can't go on.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.980]   The crisis in Greece is the forerunner, and no matter how angry people may get when their
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:40.440]   entitlements are threatened or taken away, you can't create tax income out of nowhere.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:47.820]   And the support base is not going to be there indefinitely, not to mention other disincentives
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.060]   that plague socialist economies over the long haul.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:59.440]   So for Bernie Sanders or anyone else, to commend a socialism like that of Denmark as the system
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:07.400]   that is going to do things well for us is short-sighted to say the least.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:14.780]   So in general, I would say that the impulses of biblical Christianity include, one, compassion
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:23.840]   for the disadvantaged; two, justice under law without respect to status; three, freedom
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.920]   to create and produce; and four, private property.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:38.200]   And my own sense is that history and reason and further biblical reflection lead to the
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:46.640]   conclusion that freedom and property rights lead to greater long-term well-being, or like
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:52.400]   we say today, flourishing for the greatest number.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:09:00.800]   And it should not go unsaid, lastly, that every economic and political system will eventually
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:11.040]   collapse where there are insufficient moral impulses to restrain human selfishness and
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.120]   encourage honesty and good deeds even when no one is watching.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.120]   That's very interesting.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.080]   I appreciate your thoughts on economics and socialism.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.400]   We don't get a lot of questions on socialism, I'll admit, but we do get a ton of questions
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.960]   on spiritual depression.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.680]   We are the joy people after all, Christian hedonists at Desiring God.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.200]   So what do we do when spiritual depression descends into our lives?
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   What do we do?
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   How do we respond?
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.120]   John Piper will explain next time.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.200]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
