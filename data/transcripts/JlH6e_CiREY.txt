[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.340]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rest, where we take your questions and answer them, provide some
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.720]   context, a little analysis. Remember, our email is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Today's
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.900]   sponsor is Craneshares. Craneshares is an investment company that allows you to invest
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.800]   in China, but they also have funds focused on the transition to renewable energies. Duncan,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.920]   you can get behind this one. We actually had Luke Oliver from Craneshares on Animal Spirits
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.320]   I think just about a year ago, talking about investing in carbon allowances. Luke actually
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.940]   has a new piece up outlining how they work, how they tie into climate change, along with
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.480]   the investing implications. Worth a read. If you want to read this piece and learn more,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.480]   go to craneshares.com. Duncan, we emptied our inbox for the last show of the year. I
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.640]   have a few questions on the stock market that we brought in Bill to answer all of your year-end
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.320]   tax questions. I just want to let you know, my Christmas present to you is that I let
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.280]   go of the idea of doing a 12 days of finance. I thought about it. I had it in a hopper.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.840]   Some good musical opportunities. As long as you would have been able to sing them, that
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.280]   would have been good. I would have had to. My gift to you is not embarrassing myself
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.720]   by going through with it. So Merry Christmas. Thank you. All right. Let's talk about the
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.720]   live show at the end. Let's get into the first question.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.560]   Wathen: OK. Up first, we have a question from Brian, who writes, "Big fan of the show and
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.040]   all the compound content. I know no one can predict the future, yada yada yada, but just
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.500]   between us, what's going to happen with the stock market next year? I'm not sure I can
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.540]   handle another year like 2022." Same, honestly. It's pretty rough.
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.140]   Lewis: The good news is, big, huge, back-to-back losses are pretty rare. Life would be a lot
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.400]   easier if I could just give you the answer to the question. I guess the good news is,
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.760]   there's not much connective tissue from one year to the next in terms of gains and losses.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.900]   John, do a chart on here. I did a simple analysis of the average annual stock market returns
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.680]   following an up year or a down year, going back to 1928. The average return following
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.280]   an up year is 9.8%. The average return following a down year in the prior year is 9.2%. Really
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.760]   doesn't tell you much, so not much help here. But I know what you're thinking. A lot of
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.340]   people would come back and say, "Well, Ben, how many times has the stock market been up
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.780]   following a year where the Fed is in a tightening cycle, or when inflation remains above average,
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.980]   or when there's such a high probability of a recession, or when interest rates have risen
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.140]   so precipitously, or when there's going to be another fast and furious installment released
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.700]   in the following year?" Can you believe they're on No. 10 already?
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.600]   Lewis: I can't remember the last one I saw, if I'm being honest.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.660]   Did they teach you about sequels in film school? Because that's obviously all you need to know
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.780]   to make hit movies.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.060]   Lewis: That and horror films, easy money.
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.500]   I guess so. Here's my one big takeaway that's not really groundbreaking. The stock market
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.860]   is inherently unpredictable. Sure, we all understand the current environment and what
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.460]   it looks like, but that doesn't help you figure out how things are going to shake out. Just
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.740]   think about how many people at the end of 2019, coming into the year, forecast a pandemic
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.200]   that would cause lockdowns, quarantines, millions of people working from home, schools being
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.840]   shut down, the worst quarterly GDP print in modern history, and then the biggest government
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.560]   spending package since World War II. How many people had that on their bingo card? Of course,
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.300]   no one. Coming into this year, how many people predicted that a crazy person in Russia would
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.580]   invade an innocent country that would cause an upheaval in food and energy prices, and
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.740]   then we'd have the highest inflation in four decades, and the Federal Reserve would be
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.880]   actively rooting for the stock market to come down? No one predicted that, right?
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   No.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.020]   Let's do a tweet on here. This is Bloomberg's Jonathan Farrell. He posted this weekend the
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.220]   year-end 2022 stock market forecast from all the big banks and Wall Street firms. This
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.340]   was done at the beginning of the year, of course. You can see the range is anywhere
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.060]   in the S&P from $4,400 to $5,400. Right now, the S&P is trading around $3,800. Now, the
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.220]   point here is not to dunk on these Wall Street people who make forecasts. That's part of
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.700]   their job, but it's just to show how ludicrous it is to think you have the ability to predict
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.680]   what's going to happen over any year-long period. Sure, someone's bound to get lucky
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.060]   and nail it once just because of the sheer number of people making predictions these
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.620]   days, but I have no idea what's going to happen.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.260]   Well, you've got to shoot your shot, right? I mean, that's...
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.060]   Sure. It's kind of fun to put stuff out there, but you have to think more in terms of probabilities
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.460]   and then tail events that could upend any of those probabilities. So, I have no idea
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.640]   what's going to happen in 2023, neither does anyone else. And I guess this is the reason
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.900]   you have a plan in the first place. If you knew it was going to happen, there would be
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.980]   no need for an investment plan. That's the whole point of a plan is because you have
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.820]   to kind of think in terms of probabilities and ranges of outcomes, and that's where I
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.260]   stand. So, not much help. I don't know if stocks will be up or down next year.
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.300]   All that being said, what is your S&P target for 2023?
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.060]   Well, what did you say yesterday? If stocks go up, you have a target, and if stocks go
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.820]   down, you have a target? That's not a bad way to put it.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.260]   Yeah, I said, if stocks go up $45, $50, and if they go down $3,600.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.860]   Okay. That's not a bad way to look at it. Because it gives you a range of returns, right?
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.060]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.420]   I don't know. All right, let's do another one.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.820]   Okay. Question two today is from Swayze. Cool name. "Higher inflation should be good for
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.900]   stocks. Not bad, right? If prices are rising in the U.S. economy, it means some group -- corporations,
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.500]   the government, or individual taxpayers -- is generating more income. If rent is up, my landlord
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.300]   is making more money. If gas is up, energy companies are making more money. If wages
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.740]   are up, individuals are making more money. The data shows that wage increases haven't
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.580]   kept up with inflation and taxes haven't gone up, which means that corporations, not individuals
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.100]   or the government, have to be the ones benefiting, right? So, corporate earnings in aggregate
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.180]   are only getting better in this inflationary environment. Is the stock market getting this
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.420]   wrong?"
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.420]   Obviously the stock market is right. I'll say that. This does make sense in theory,
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.100]   especially since you look at corporations. They have pricing power. They can raise their
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.020]   prices and pass along to consumers, which is kind of what a lot of them have done. Obviously,
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.580]   corporations have higher costs, too, so you have to think about commodity inputs and that
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.420]   sort of thing. But considering margins remain near or at all-time highs, this is kind of
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.140]   what's happened. But even if that's the case, high inflation is generally bad for the stock
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.580]   market. Why? Warren Buffett wrote a piece in 1977 for Fortune magazine called "How Inflation
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.540]   Swindles the Equity Investor." Inflation was scalding hot at the time. It had been running
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.860]   hot for a very long time, almost a decade. His main takeaway was that stocks are more
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.100]   similar to bonds than most people think, especially when it comes to a highly inflationary environment.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.660]   For bonds, it's not necessarily the rates rising that hurts as much as the inflation.
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.020]   It's the real returns over the long term that can eat into bonds. So, he talked about how
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.300]   it might not seem to make sense since bonds have a fixed yield and stocks kind of have
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.660]   this return on equity, or earnings, which can vary. But his point was that, if you look
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.420]   back at history, the ROE, the return on equity for U.S. corporations, is relatively sticky
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.460]   and stable over the decades. He said it's like 12%. I think it's actually maybe gone
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.260]   up a little bit since then. The problem is, obviously, the price people are willing to
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.700]   pay for that ROE can vary, but here's a quote from Buffett. "Your future results will be
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.520]   governed by three variables. The relationship between book value and market value, the tax
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.140]   rate and the inflation rate." So, there we are. 12%, which is the ROE, before taxes and
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.500]   inflation, 7% after taxes and before inflation, and maybe 0% after taxes and inflation. It
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.700]   hardly sounds like a formula that will keep all those cattle stampeding on TV. As a common
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:12.180]   stockholder, you will have more dollars, but you may not have as much purchasing power.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.180]   So the whole thing is, is that inflation is going to eat into your ROE, regardless of
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.580]   what happens to your earnings. Because if you look at it, the 1970s had really strong
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.780]   profit growth, right? It was up like 9.9% per year. If you look back at the last nine
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.900]   decades of earnings growth, the 1970s was the second largest earnings growth we've seen,
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.780]   on a nominal basis. Duncan, do you know what the first one was? Care to make a guess?
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.420]   No.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.580]   The 2010s has the largest profit growth of any decade, going back to the 1930s. Mainly
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:48.300]   because banks got decimated in 2008, but still. So, the '70s was the second. That's great.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.580]   It looks good on a nominal basis, but on a real basis, it really doesn't matter. Unfortunately,
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.620]   what this means is that high inflation tends to be bad for both stocks and bonds. Thanks
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.580]   a lot, Ben. You could have brought that to our attention. What's that M Sandler one?
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.180]   Yesterday? Things that could have been brought to my attention yesterday? P.S., if you're
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.940]   following along on my blog, I wrote about this exact relationship in February, why the
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.100]   stock market doesn't like high inflation. I wish I would have taken my own advice back
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.500]   then. At the time, I think the S&P was only down 3%. I guess I didn't think inflation
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.420]   was going to get as bad as it was. This is not a true not to brag, though, because I
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.940]   certainly underestimated how much damage high inflation could cause in rising interest rates.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.700]   But that's a thing. I think that inflation just eats into your returns as an investor,
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.260]   whether you know it or not.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.060]   Right. And you couldn't predict what your pals at the Fed were going to do.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:40.060]   Yeah, those jerks. See, this is the problem. People were excortiating the Fed for years,
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.740]   saying all they do is care about the stock market. The Fed never once said, "We want
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.140]   the stock market to go up." This year, they said, "We want it to go down." Right?
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.300]   I just have to point out that you were giving Mike a hard time about granular, and you just
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.020]   said "excortiating" on a podcast.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.460]   Pull that straight out of my rear end. Come on.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:02.020]   One follow-up I do have about that question, though, is, like a wise man wrote in a book
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.780]   that I've been reading, "Saving for Retirement" --
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.100]   Took you long enough. Geez.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.460]   But in there, it's the best thing you can do, right? The stock market is basically the
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.420]   best thing you can do for inflation.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.660]   Over the short term, the stock market is going to be impacted by inflation. But over the
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.220]   long term, the stock market remains your best hedge against inflation. That's the problem.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.820]   So, yeah, the takeaway is not, "So, that's why you shouldn't invest in the stock market."
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.340]   Yeah. It's just, over the short term, you're going to see some compression in valuations,
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.180]   and it's not very good over the short run for stocks. Over the long run, the stock market
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.300]   remains, because dividends grow above the inflation rate, earnings grow above the inflation
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.980]   rate, and that's why stocks do better than inflation over the long term.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.220]   Yes, it still remains your best bet.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.740]   That's an important lesson to make sure our younger and new investors are taking away
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.740]   from this.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.980]   Great point. Yes. All right. Let's do another one.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.500]   Okay. Question three. This one's from Nate. "Earlier this year, I sold some Palladium
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.820]   bars I originally purchased in 2005. From my internet research, precious metals are
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:09.320]   categorized as collectibles and are taxed at a maximum rate of 28%. Can I tax-loss harvest
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.740]   stocks to offset the capital gains from my Palladium sale? Are there restrictions on
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.740]   what can be offset by tax-loss harvesting, other than the $3,000 of income per year?"
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.380]   All right. Let's bring in the taxman himself, Bill Sweet, to answer this one. Bill, I'm
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.820]   not going to lie. I have no idea what Palladium is. I would have thought that was something
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.580]   that Bond villain tries to steal.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.580]   Yeah. It sounds like it belongs in a nuclear reactor. Yeah.
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.620]   I did not know you could buy it and borrow from it. I guess it's some sort of precious
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.420]   metal. It is something people can... Duncan told us you can invest in it in ETF form,
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.420]   I guess.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.420]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.700]   Can you tell us a little bit about how the collectible stuff works? Because I have heard
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.260]   this before that commodities have a similar tax treatment to collectibles, how that works
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.020]   and how that interacts with your stock losses, potentially.
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:55.180]   Yeah. I'm fresh off my kid's Christmas concert, and we were not discussing Shea Stadium, Palladium,
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.580]   or EMC Squared, any of that. But yeah, this is a collectible. Ben, I know you're a big
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.260]   collectibles guy. Some of our sponsors, for example, do great work there. Anything that's
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.540]   an art, or let's say rug, I know Duncan's a big rug guy, antiques, metals, including
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:16.020]   ETFs backed by metals, gems, stamps, comic books, coins, alcoholic beverages that you
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.700]   don't consume, guys, that's the key, musical instruments, and historical objects, such
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.900]   as the copy of the Constitution I keep in my basement. Those are all subject to a maximum,
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:32.500]   maximum tax rate of 28%. So if your ordinary income rate is, let's say, 12%, 22%, or 24%,
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.380]   which is where it is up to about $195,000 if you're filing single, that would be actually
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.500]   just the lower ordinary income rate. So really, the 28% thing really only applies for people
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.860]   making, let's say, $200,000 a year or more. But that said, not sure how many Palladium
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.460]   bars we were talking about for our guy here. Ultimately, that can add up. Ben, the key
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.860]   question here is that can I net this out against my other capital assets? And the answer, fortunately,
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.260]   is yes, is that like other gains from property or losses, and boy, have there been a lot
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.540]   of losses this year, you can net out your capital gains from your Palladium bars.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.660]   It all goes into the same bucket, right? All the losses and gains, net them out.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.460]   Yeah. The technical answer is there's actually three buckets, right? So there's short-term,
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:19.740]   long-term, and then short-term, long-term from a partnership. But yes, the concept is
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.020]   the short losses net out the short gains. The long losses net out the long losses. And
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.620]   it all goes into one big blender. And at the end of that, whatever's left, depending on
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.060]   the nature of it, that can be taxed at a maximum of 28%.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.860]   For most people this year, it's going to have to be long-term capital gains because there's
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.100]   not many short-term capital gains.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.560]   Not a whole lot. No baking around. I mean, it is possible, right, if you got really lucky
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.500]   in the end of September. But ultimately, that's the case. So yeah, I think you've still got
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.220]   time. You have about, what, six trading days left, maybe four or five trading days left
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.380]   in the year to go ahead and realize some losses, right? Cryptocurrency generally is down 80%,
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.920]   90% this year. So realize those losses, bake it off against your gains, and hopefully that'll
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.060]   make a dent in that tax that you're due in April.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.580]   This might be a stupid question. First of all, I can't even imagine how you go about
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.340]   selling physical bars of a metal. Like, I guess it's a pawn shop.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.340]   Pawn shop.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.180]   Yeah, you don't have an exchange. You just put it in a mailbox with a sticker and somebody
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.180]   comes and takes it.
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.100]   But so how is the price set? So I can't just go somewhere and sell it for 50 bucks a bar
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.100]   and take a huge loss, right?
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.340]   Well, have you ever seen those stores that say, like, we buy gold here? It's got to be
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.340]   something like that.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.180]   Yeah. They're everywhere in New Jersey. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, you can walk in there with
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.500]   some metal and see what they'll do for you.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.500]   Market price minus a broker fee.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.820]   It seems like someone could intentionally take a big tax loss that way, right?
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.140]   I've personally never sold a palladium bar before, so I don't know. I feel like you'd
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.100]   need a nuclear reactor. It sounds like something like that to me.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.100]   Do you have to smelt it?
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.100]   As opposed to the metal.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.420]   Is there smelting involved? Yeah, I'm not sure either. But no, but congratulations. I mean,
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.980]   ultimately, if you've held that long, I mean, just about anything, you hold it for 20 years,
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.820]   generally you get some price appreciation, even good beer.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.820]   Except for my old Beanie Babies and Pogs.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.340]   Yeah, but at the high there in $1.99.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:58.220]   Okay. Question four is from John. I'm about to rebalance my retirement accounts in January.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.300]   I'm thinking of switching all of my index holdings from mutual funds to ETFs. Do you
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.020]   see any reason not to do this?
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:10.120]   All right. Here's the ETF pros. Lower cost, typically in a mutual fund. More tax efficient.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.860]   Same exact strategy. The only thing I can think of that's easier with a mutual fund
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.700]   that you can automate purchases and sales easier in rebalancing, right? A little easier.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.620]   You can do that with a lot of some places with ETFs now. What do you think? Is there
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.460]   any reason not to do this?
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:27.300]   Yeah. No, I can't think of anything significant. Probably the only advantage that you would
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.580]   have from a five ticker mutual fund, Ben, is exactly what you just discussed. That ultimately
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.220]   the systematic purchases tend to be a little bit easier because you're just doing that
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.740]   through the fund, right? You don't have to go through an exchange. Most exchanges will
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.020]   offer you commissionless trades, but not all, right? So ultimately you might pay some ticker
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.620]   charges. The other factor, Ben, I might just throw out, it's technical, but there's a bit
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.380]   of spread, right? With an ETF that you don't have to mess around with if a five ticker
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.660]   mutual fund. Every night those things rebalance at net asset value. And basically you're buying
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.500]   it net of any commission costs you might pay at net asset value versus an ETF where there
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.260]   might be a bit of a bid-ask spread or premium or discount on the trade. So that's really
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.500]   the only factor.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.820]   But I think this is a great year to make this switch. It's been a very difficult year for
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.580]   just about everybody in just about every asset class. And so if your capital gains have been
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:19.220]   cut by 20%, let's say, on where you were this year, taxes are the primary reason why
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.180]   most of our investors, Ben, end up holding onto these legacy five ticker mutual funds.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.260]   And the key difference though, you get this, the big benefit I would focus on is right
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.380]   now, like this week, probably right now, you're getting capital gains distributions from your
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.340]   mutual funds. So let's say a hypothetical, a US mutual fund, a five ticker mutual fund,
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.380]   they need to distribute by year end 90% of what they realize in capital gains throughout
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.840]   the year. A year like this, it's not just that prices are down, but typically there's
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.020]   more redemptions, right? Investors tend to get spooked when their investments decline.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.980]   And so even if you hold onto those shares for a five ticker mutual fund, what tends
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.820]   to happen at the end of the year is you get whacked with a capital gains distribution.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.300]   It just gets reinvested in the fund, but you have to pay tax basically on the actions of
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.300]   other investors.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.420]   And as people make this shift, it's going to keep happening.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:08.500]   I think so. I think so. So I think there's a long tail, right? Probably 20, 30, 40 years.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.540]   But yeah, ultimately if you get ahead of it and some really awesome funds, some of the
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.420]   Vanguard mutual funds, some of the iShares, some of the other funds that are out there
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.700]   have had like 10%, 15% net asset value capital gains this year.
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.580]   So ultimately it's this process of do you bite the bullet? Do you rip the Band-Aid off
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.860]   and just realize the gains and move on into the ETF and then not have to worry about this
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.780]   again? Because the neat thing about an ETF is it can trade those low basis securities,
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.980]   those stocks with the market. And so ETFs throughout the year, if you have a good fund
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.320]   manager, they're stepping up their basis probably every day of the market, whereas a five ticker
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.060]   mutual fund cannot. That's the key difference.
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:47.980]   It almost doesn't feel fair to mutual funds. Yeah, no, it doesn't. But like dinosaurs,
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.460]   they might be getting obsolete, right? So they still have a place I think in investing.
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.780]   But I think the ETF in the late '90s, that was a strategically forward, sort of like
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.700]   the money market mutual fund was in the 1970s, 1980s. It just opened up the door to a new
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.660]   wave of investing and probably the thing that's going to replace ETFs, which we have been
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.940]   doing for our clients for almost three years now, the direct indexing approach, right?
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.320]   So the market's constantly evolving, in my opinion, constantly getting better ETF over
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.500]   mutual fund, I think now's the time.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.380]   But they'll always have that extra character in the ticker.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.860]   Yep. Yep. It's very cool. Yeah, no, but yeah, I think that's it. And now's the time, generally.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.860]   Next question.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:26.860]   Do it.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:31.340]   Okay, this question's from John spelled with an H. The previous one was like Jonathan John.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.900]   On episode 51, you addressed changing asset allocation as net worth increases. I have
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:42.780]   a follow up question. Looking forward to 2026, when the federal federal estate tax exclusion
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:48.220]   reverts to 2017 levels, maybe between six and seven million. Does it make sense to reduce
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.900]   risk as your net worth approaches this level? It seems like you have a partner on the upside
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:58.700]   40% estate tax, while the downside risk is all yours. Am I thinking about this correctly?
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.340]   This is a subtle not to brag here.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.340]   I have no idea.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:06.460]   Yeah, these portfolio rescue questions constantly impress me, the listeners with their $7 million
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.460]   portfolios.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.220]   Phil, I have no idea how estate taxes work. Explain it to me and what this change is potentially
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.220]   coming down the line.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.220]   Yeah, so-
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.220]   Should this person die before 2026 to save on taxes?
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.300]   No, I would not recommend dying in order to save on taxes. That generally-
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.300]   Just checking.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.620]   Yeah, we'd be putting literally the tax-
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.300]   Over all our bases here.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:29.020]   Yeah, or whatever we want to say. But no, but it's an interesting question. So what
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.660]   the listener's getting at is, unfortunately, father time is undefeated, Ben. I hate to
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.000]   break this to you, the both of you, but there will come a time when we have to settle our
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.220]   affairs or for our spouses or loved ones. And yeah, if you happen to pass away and your
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:45.580]   net worth is above whatever the estate tax exemption today, it's 12.9, so effectively
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:52.020]   $13 million per person. If you're above that limit, there is a phase in the estate tax
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:57.820]   that applies. It starts at 12% and rolls all the way up to 40% of assets. And so what the
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.740]   listener is getting at here is that, ultimately, like you said, there's a partner, potentially,
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.580]   to realize some of the gains upon his passing or her passing. So ultimately, again, I wouldn't
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.260]   wish death on anybody, but thinking about how to plan for this, I think the solution
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.180]   is very easy. You just do your best to stay below the limit. What the listener is getting
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:20.380]   at to explain it, so right now, today, this very- or excuse me, next year, the estate
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:26.500]   tax limit is close to $13 million. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Trump-era tax
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.540]   code change of 2017, that is set to expire. It is set to sunset in Congress beginning
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:37.060]   in tax year 2026. And so at that time, we do expect the limit to revert. However, it
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.260]   depends on what Congress does between now and then. And as we're seeing this week, they're
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.940]   rushing through. I'm not sure if this is made news, but like a $1.2, $1.3 trillion spending
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.900]   bill. And so Congress tends to do things at the last minute. And I think my advice would
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.740]   be for somebody that's in between that range, let's say $7 and $13 million of assets, first
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.500]   of all, you won the game. So reducing your risk, I think, would be a great thing to play.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.020]   But isn't this kind of like your thing? You always say, like, why would you not make more
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.740]   money just because you're paying taxes on that money? Is that not the same thing here?
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:08.220]   Yeah. Yeah. And then my point is that there's time. So if this tax law is going to change
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.860]   potentially in January 2026, and we know what the limit is now, you can start gifting out
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:18.100]   assets to your heirs in between now and then. Many states do not have a gift tax, New York
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.700]   among them. Many states do not have an estate tax at all. So you do have to pay attention
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.700]   to the--
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.740]   So this could be the kind of thing where you could do charitable contributions too, right?
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.740]   Front load those, potentially?
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.140]   That's where I'm going. Yeah. You don't just have to gift assets to charity, although that's
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.180]   a great thing to do, right? And leave a bequest at your passing to get below that estate limit.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.140]   Sit down with an estate planner and attorney, write your will a little bit differently to
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.060]   take advantage of this. Or more so, make that choice. Do I want my money to go to the federal
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.660]   government or do I want it to go to my library down the street?
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.220]   Can you give your favorite charity bars of palladium?
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.900]   That is definitely something you could do and is subject to the property rules and would
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.780]   be a great way to avoid the 28% tax.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.540]   The point here is, like, talk to an estate planner about this.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.180]   This is very complex, but you have time to do it. I think generally, if your net worth
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.380]   is this high, absolutely. I think it's a great concept to think about lowering your risk
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.820]   if that's applicable. Sit down with a financial planner or CFP and think about it. But I also
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.220]   would sit down and talk to an estate planner. What do you actually want your money to do?
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.480]   If you don't care where it goes and you want to help finance the federal government, leave
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.480]   it alone. Let it compound.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.340]   So here's someone who 2022 was a good year for. It had to decrease their net worth.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.340]   If they're still looking at it, yeah.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.340]   It's helping out with estate taxes.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.980]   I think so. But the last thing, Ben, you know what the back tattoo is. I don't want to take
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.380]   my jacket off right now, but it reads Roth IRA conversion. And so if the government is
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.580]   going to get 40% of your assets, a great way to lower your estate tax is to voluntarily
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.100]   pay some income tax. And then that's less because, again, whether it's a traditional
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.900]   IRA or a Roth IRA, the 40% tax applies. So why not just fork that money over earlier?
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.460]   And then your heirs will get a Roth IRA and just distribute that over 10 years, completely
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.460]   income tax-free.
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:51.300]   Nice. Okay. All right. Speaking of Roth, we had a Roth question. We couldn't leave without
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.300]   asking one more of those.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.300]   Oh, I'm in the right place.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   Merry Christmas to me.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.780]   Derek coming in with the Roth question.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:57.780]   Let's do it.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.720]   With time, the percentage of our portfolio that is Roth is less than 10% and getting
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.220]   smaller every year. At what dollar amount saved would it be beneficial for us to diversify
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:12.020]   and contribute retirement money into Roth or after-tax contributions? Should I shift
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.220]   and make after-tax retirement contributions now, despite being in a high tax bracket,
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.980]   which will largely eliminate the largest tax deduction I take every year? We don't itemize
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.980]   deductions.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:27.140]   All right. He wants more Roth dollars working for him, which I'm sure you can get behind,
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.500]   Mr. Roth. What does he need to do to make this happen?
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:36.860]   So answer one is, this is a complex question and we cannot give people direct advice here
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.980]   on this show. Shout out to our Chief Compliance Officer, Patricia Hetzfeld. But in general,
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:47.500]   what I would advise somebody to think about is, what is my current tax rate? And they
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.620]   indicate high versus what is my future tax rate going to be? And that, to me, drives
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.100]   the traditional versus Roth conversation.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.620]   Let me give you the Michael Kitsis answer, which I think in this scenario would be the
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.620]   right one, in that when you're contributing, I think it does make sense, especially if
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.720]   you're in a high tax bracket, which I would define as 32%, 35%, 37%. So we're talking
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.460]   people making $300,000 a year or more. Ultimately, I think it would make sense in that tax bracket
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.260]   to do the traditional first, right? Because ultimately, you can make a decision towards
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.620]   the end of the year, depending on your capital gains, depending on how many bars of Palladium
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.900]   you put in the mailbox and stuck a sticker on. Depending on your big picture scenario,
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.980]   you can make a choice to do a Roth area conversion late in the year. But ultimately, you cannot
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.460]   go back, right? So it's a one-way street. Once you make that Roth conversion, thou shalt
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.860]   not undo it anymore.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.920]   So I think it would make sense in this scenario, generally, to do a traditional contribution
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.100]   throughout the year and then make a decision on whether Roth convert when you have a low
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.220]   tax year, when you have a tax break, when there's something else.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.580]   So you're saying for most people making that Roth decision, you can wait till December
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.740]   and see how your year looks and kind of get a good idea and then decide whether you want
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:47.740]   to do it or not?
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.100]   Yeah, I think so. For somebody that's in a high tax bracket, Ben, that's exactly it.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.020]   Because if you're paying 32, if you're paying 37%, you probably don't want to add to that.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:58.820]   And the listener's question framework was, this is probably my largest tax deduction,
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.900]   my traditional 401(k). I'm putting $20,000 a year away and I'm able to deduct that. Do
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.700]   I want to flip the switch? And I would say, again, no, you probably don't. But you can
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.460]   make that decision on a year-to-year basis and do it via Roth conversion. But I probably
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.340]   in this scenario would contribute to the 401(k) on a traditional basis.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:20.020]   We want to mention, we talked about this yesterday, 401(k) limit is going from $20,500 to $22,500
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.020]   next year.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:26.380]   Yeah. Thanks, President Biden, right? Inflation cuts both ways. And yeah, for savers, that's
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.740]   a really, really good thing, right? So obviously, if we could choose, we would say no inflation.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:33.420]   But the good news is anything that's inflation adjusted, including your tax brackets, including
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.980]   your standard deduction, that's going up along with inflation too, to the tune of 7, 8, 9%.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.660]   So yes, that's a good thing for savers.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.620]   Awesome. All right. The only other thing this person needs to do is ask their employer to
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.420]   start having a Roth 401(k), right?
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.260]   Yeah. And it's interesting too, the omnibus bill, it looks like there might be a provision
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.940]   that might come out starting early next year for the employer match to be happening in
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.900]   Roth contributions. So that's interesting because right now-
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.900]   Hand up, hand up. Omnibus.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.900]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.900]   No idea. I got nothing.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.900]   Latin. I took Latin.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:07.620]   Yeah, it's 6,000 pages of potential tax law. And it's not even real tax law yet, right?
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.180]   Because it hasn't been passed. So if you really want some bedtime reading, I think that's
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.220]   it for Christmas Eve.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.340]   Speaking of reading, in this book again, another plug.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.060]   Duncan, a company man.
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:26.720]   I learned how recent 401(k)s became a thing. I didn't know, like in the late '70s, right?
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.060]   I just, in my head, thought that they'd been around since at least like the '50s or something.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.680]   That's why a lot of people need to give themselves a little bit of slack if you're not very well
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.780]   prepared for retirement. It's a concept that hasn't been around very long. It really hasn't.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.500]   Yeah, most of the time you worked and then you died. That's my plan today, hopefully
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.940]   in my '90s. But no, the Roth hasn't been around since I think '95 it was signed into law.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.140]   I don't think that you could do a Roth area until 1997. So yeah, we're only looking at
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.980]   25 years. And that's not enough compounding for me, guys. I need some more.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.980]   All right, we got one more.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.980]   I'll always take more.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.980]   Give it all to your kids, Bill.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.660]   Always more compounding, right? More compound?
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.100]   Yeah, compound gains.
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.220]   Okay, so last but not least, when looking for a CPA or tax preparer, what are the smart
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.220]   questions to ask? How do I know if the fee is fair? Is there any correlation between
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.980]   net worth and the complexity of a tax return? Is there an advantage to seeking a CPA whose
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.420]   practice is within one's own state? So that's kind of a cheat because that's multiple questions
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.860]   in one, but they're good.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:23.700]   This is a good, I'm actually surprised a lot of tax questions we get that we haven't gotten
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.740]   this one sooner. I mean, obviously, I think maybe everyone just assumed Bill would do
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.860]   pro bono tax work for everyone emailing into the show.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.980]   I did have somebody send me a Chipotle gift card, which was very kind. Thank you, Bill.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.140]   So beyond asking friends and family, where do you even begin trying to find some answers
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.140]   to these questions?
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.900]   Yeah, so like any other professional, ultimately, this is more art than science, right? So you
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.420]   can read reviews, you can do X, Y, Z. But the question was, what smart questions can
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.980]   I ask? So this would be my take on it. I think the big software providers, the turbo taxes
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.460]   of the world, the Intuits, the tax slayers, I think they do a very, very good job for
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.740]   the purpose of commoditized tax returns.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.500]   So I would separate in my mind the work that is actually a tax filing, which in my opinion
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.100]   can be done mostly by software. Who knows, ChatGPT might come out with a tax filing service.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.420]   We'll do it all through AI next year. And I think the cost for that is somewhere around
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:19.420]   $50 or $100, and maybe more if you're filing multiple states. But that to me is table stakes.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.740]   So what questions should you ask a tax professional that you might want to be working with?
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.100]   My opinion, the cardinal sin, in my opinion, of most of the tax professional community
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.020]   is they are driving while looking at the rearview mirror. They do not care about what happens
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.780]   this year. They don't care what happens next year. They care about what happened last year,
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.340]   because ultimately, that's the business model. Can I crank out a tax return and charge $300,
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.340]   $400, $500, $1,000?
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:45.100]   We should also, full disclosure here, you used to run a CPA tax practice, right?
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.100]   I did. I did.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.700]   Now you run a tax practice for us, but it was an actual tax preparation, tax filing,
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.700]   all that stuff.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.140]   We have tried through our two years, and Bill Archeroni, big shout outs, because he's done
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.540]   amazing work here in the space and is taking a well-deserved week off. So I hope he's not
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.220]   watching today. But ultimately, he's spending time with his child. But ultimately, we have
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.460]   tried to solve for this. And the way we've tried to solve for this is by setting up a
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:12.900]   series of meetings throughout the year that's in concert with our work as advisors and start
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:18.380]   to look ahead. We build a tax return during the year, and then we sort of lay it all up
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.780]   with this fourth quarter meeting. So I think that back to the question, I would engage
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.220]   with the CPA and find out how much forward tax planning can I expect to receive from
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.020]   this relationship? Are we going to be able to meet in October, November, December? Are
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.860]   you going to be on vacation? Or is this something we can do? Because on 12/31, in about a week,
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.140]   Ben, it's too late. It's too late to make a charitable contribution. To make a charitable
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.500]   contribution on January 2nd, that counts in 2023. And so I would be looking, if you're
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.020]   going to work with somebody and work with a human being, I would be trying to engage
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.340]   their skills and get some forward tax advice. What can I be doing during tax season?
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.120]   So talking to someone in January or February might help out, because you're getting ahead
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   of things a little bit.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.780]   I think so. But ultimately, that's tax season, right? So I would probably just go with whatever
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:04.060]   you're doing this year and be looking for the next tax preparer, maybe in July, June/July.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.580]   After they've been able to take a vacation, they're coming back, they're sort of thinking
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.340]   about, OK, how many people do I have in extension? That, in my opinion, is a time to engage.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.460]   Last point I want to make, there are certain states that are very complex-- California,
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.500]   New York, Oregon among them, for example-- or states can be very simple. So there's no
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.020]   blanket answer here. Texas, Tennessee, Washington, they don't have a state tax, right? So you
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.920]   don't have to worry about it at all. Pennsylvania has a flat tax, not very complicated.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.140]   So I think it really all depends on your specific situation, unfortunately, which is a terrible
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:32.060]   answer for an interview show. If you have a lot of palladium bars, probably something
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.420]   you want to talk about in advance. But I think the general gist is, how much forward tax
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.540]   planning am I going to get? Because that, I think, is the big advantage you get working
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.880]   with a professional versus software.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.680]   My biggest thing, talk to more than one person, or more than one firm. You can compare and
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.440]   contrast a little bit, just to know what they're going to give you, what you can expect, what
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.400]   the fees are, all that stuff. Talk to more than one person.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.880]   It looks like you've got a pretty nice TAM here, Bill. I'm seeing in the poll in the
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.280]   chat right now, 65% of people do not use a CPA right now. So there's pretty good--
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.560]   Yeah, the software is very good, Duncan. It's great. It's great. But like anything else,
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.680]   are you getting what you're paying for, right?
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.040]   I started out with TurboTax, and it worked until things got complex for me. Then I had
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.040]   to move on to Bill Suite.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.680]   I used to do my own, and I would always upgrade for the audit protection, because I was like,
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.800]   of course, I have no idea what I just did.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.360]   Right. Well, I'm sure it's worked out. I mean, the audit rate is hysterically low.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.920]   That sounds like the warranty at Best Buy. That can't be worth it, right? There's no
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.080]   way TurboTax is going to bat for me if the US government comes after me, right?
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:32.800]   Yeah, I don't think so. I'm not going to render an opinion, but yeah, I can't imagine this
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   working.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.000]   SPF, FTX, they were using TurboTax, right?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Isn't it like--
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.840]   For real? No, I'm not. That's not a joke.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:43.400]   They were using QuickBooks, which I'm very familiar with. But yes, I find it great for
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.680]   a small business. But yeah, we weren't running anything near that line.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680]   Okay, I got you.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.960]   But no, but isn't it like the insurance policies you get for if you go buy a toaster or microwave?
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.080]   That's all pure profit for the company, right? Because they very, very rarely end up replacing
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.520]   that. So yeah, I would agree. But I think it's like anything else. Are you getting what
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.680]   you pay for, and are you valuing the relationship? That, to me, is it. And some people do a great
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.160]   job, but most people don't.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.480]   All right, we are off until the new year. Everyone's taking a break. Duncan, you met
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.400]   a bunch of our viewers at the live show last week, right?
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:18.520]   Yeah, no, it was great. At NASDAQ, and then at Perfect Pine afterwards. Met Dave from
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:24.660]   Michigan. He was awesome. Met George, a chef in Colorado Springs. He was very nice. Talked
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:29.960]   with a PhD academic researcher from California. We had all kinds of really cool people there.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.080]   It was very intelligent amount of viewers here, don't we?
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.080]   The vibes are good.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.080]   Definitely.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.080]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.920]   All right, thanks always for the people who show up live in the chat. Thanks, everyone,
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.520]   for listening and watching on YouTube. We appreciate all your feedback. Merry Christmas.

[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.440]   Happy birthday, Sean.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.440]   Big Sean.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.440]   That's right.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.440]   Happy birthday.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:16.760]   Thanks. That's tough.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:24.760]   Happy birthday, Sean.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.820]   you
