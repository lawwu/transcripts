[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   We apologise for the short breaks in sound that may be heard during parts of this recording.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   This was due to a fault on the original recording machine
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   and we hope that it doesn't spoil your concentration on this sermon by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   The Gospel according to St Luke, chapter 4, verses 22, 28, 29 and 30.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   "And all bear him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   and rose up and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   But he passing through the midst of them went his way."
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   We come back once more to a consideration of this extraordinary event
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   which took place in the synagogue of Nazareth.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   We've been looking at this incident for a number of Sunday evenings
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and we've been doing so in this way.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   A very astounding thing happened in that synagogue.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Our Lord at the age of 30 set out on his public ministry.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   He went to John the Baptist and asked him to baptize him.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And John did baptize him.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And as our Lord was coming up out of the water,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And the word from heaven came saying,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Then we are told that he was led or driven by the Spirit into the wilderness
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   to be tempted of the devil forty days and forty nights.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And then having repulsed and defeated the enemy,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   we are told that he came back in the power of the Spirit into Galilee.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And there went out a fame of him throughout all the region round about.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And then he went back to Nazareth, his home town.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And as his custom was on the Sabbath day,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   he went into the synagogue and stood up for to read.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   that's to say chapter 61 of Isaiah's prophecy,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   to preach deliverance to the captives,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   and recovering of sight to the blind,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   to set at liberty them that are bruised,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And he closed the book,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and he gave it again to the minister and sat down.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And he began to say unto them,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   This scripture is fulfilled in your ears.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And then follows the twenty-second verse.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And all bear him witness,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   But then they began to say,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Is not this Joseph's son?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Jesus, who has always been here with us, the carpenter.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And he said unto them,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Ye will surely say unto me this,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Prophet, physician, heal thyself.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   do also here in thy country.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And he said, Verily I say unto you,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   No prophet is accepted in his own country.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   But I tell you of a truth,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   when great famine was throughout all the land.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But unto none of them was Elias sent,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   unto a woman that was a widow.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   the prophet.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And none of them was cleansed,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   saving Nain and the Syrian.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And they all in the synagogue,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   when they heard these things,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   were filled with wrath,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   and rose up and thrust him out of the city,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and led him unto the brow of the hill,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   whereon their city was built,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   that they may cast him down headlong.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   But he passing through the midst of them,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   went his way, and came down to Capernaum,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   a city of Galilee,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   and taught them on the Sabbath days.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And they were astonished at his doctrine,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   for his word was with power.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Now, there's our background, there's our setting.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   The thing I'm calling attention to is this.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   We began doing it last Sunday evening.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   This is surely a most amazing and extraordinary thing,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   that the people of Nazareth,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   gathered together in that synagogue,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   should have behaved like this,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   to one who had just told them
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   that he had come to preach
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   the acceptable year of the Lord.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   He's come to give and to bring
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   the most glorious blessings
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   that men can ever imagine.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And yet here they are,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   thrusting him out of the city,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   trying to murder him,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   in wrath and fury.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Oh, I'm calling attention to it,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   because you see there,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   at the very outset of our Lord's ministry,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   the key seems to have been set
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   for the whole of his ministry.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   The staggering thing that confronts us
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   in the four Gospels is this,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   that when the Son of God came into this world,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   he was rejected.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   He was despised.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   He was rejected of men.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   They preferred a thief and a robber to him.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   The crowd cried away with him,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   "Crucify him!"
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Their rulers conspired together
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   in order to get rid of him.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   That's the thing we're confronted with.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   The very thing that these people did
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   in the synagogue of Nazareth,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   was done by the rulers and by the people.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   The fact that we have facing us,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   everywhere in the New Testament,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   is a cross, a gibbet.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And the Son of God nailed to it,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   crucified, slain, rejected of men.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I'm calling attention to it,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   because according to this word,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   this word of God,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   our eternal destiny depends upon
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   our reaction and our response to this person.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And you see, the New Testament makes it perfectly plain and clear
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   that there are only two possible responses.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   We either believe in him,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   or else we reject him.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   There's no neutrality possible.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Not to believe in him is to reject him.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Not to accept him and to deny yourself
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   and take up your cross and to go after him,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   means that you are definitely against him.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   He himself said so.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It's the whole message of the New Testament.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And according to this book,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   we've already considered it.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   If we don't realize before we die
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   that this is the acceptable year of the Lord,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   there is nothing awaiting us
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   but the day of vengeance of our God.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Final judgment and everlasting perdition.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So you see, this is the most momentous thing
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   that a company of people such as ourselves this evening
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   can ever consider.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Now, here we've got, I say,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   the essence of the New Testament teaching
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   with regard to this matter.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Here are people who rejected him.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   He never went back there again.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   They had their opportunity.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   They never had it again.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   So because of the momentous character of this question,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   because of the dreaded possibilities
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   that are confronting us,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   surely the most important thing for us to do
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   is to discover if we can,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   what was it that made those people of Nazareth
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   behave in that way?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   What was it that produced this sudden change in them?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Because you notice that at first they bear him witness
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   and wondered at the gracious words
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   that proceeded out of his mouth.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   As I showed last Sunday evening,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   they were attracted by him,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   their eyes were all fastened on him.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   They were hanging on his lips.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   "What's he going to say?" they said.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   "Isn't it marvelous?"
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   They saw something strange about him.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And his gracious words,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   his wonderful exposition,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   his application of Isaiah's prophecy to himself,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   at first they liked it,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   but in a moment everything changes.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And they begin to have their second thoughts,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   and they say, "Isn't this Joseph's son?"
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And then you remember how he replied to that.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And that filled them with wrath,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   and they tried to destroy him.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Well now the question is, I ask,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   what is it that makes people do that?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   What is it that accounts for the fact
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   that there's anybody in the world tonight
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   who isn't a Christian?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   With the world in its present predicament,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   in its appalling condition,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   why is it that men and women won't turn to this?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   They've tried everything else.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   They've listened to all their prophets
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   and philosophers and teachers,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   and nobody seems able to help.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And the world is becoming increasingly a morass.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And here is a way offered that will give deliverance,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and yet men and women reject it,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and him will scorn and take to everything else.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Why is it?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   That's the great question of the ages.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   What's the matter?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Oh, I emphasize the tragedy of it,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   because the tragedy is this.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   The one they tried to throw down
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   from the brow of that hill
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   was the Son of God.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And they were rejecting all these blessings
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   that he said he'd come to give.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   They were rejecting salvation.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   If he'd come to damn and to blast and to destroy,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   we can understand their antagonism,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   but he has come to bless.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Never were more gracious words uttered than these,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   and yet they say away with him.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   What is this?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Well, I suggested it was what the Bible calls unbelief.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   That's the trouble, unbelief.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And my point last Sunday was that unbelief
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   is not a matter of intellect,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   it's a matter of state or condition.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I showed you from this record
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   that unbelief is a state and an attitude of soul
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   imposed upon us by the devil,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   which manifests a terrible power.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   It can group us and control us.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   It leads to passion.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It produces prejudice and hatred and wrath.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And it works upon our pride and through our pride.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   That was the trouble with these people.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   But there it was in general.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And I said that this evening, God willing,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   we'd come on to deal with it in particular,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   and now I'm proceeding to do so.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   This state of unbelief manifests itself in certain ways.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Oh, I do trust that everybody's clear
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   about that first proposition,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   that it is a state or a condition.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   There is no such thing as a man in absolute detachment
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   applying his mind to the gospel.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   It's impossible.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Our minds are not detached.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   A man is not some kind of reasoning machine
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   or animal sitting in a vacuum.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   No, no.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   A man's mind is governed by the whole man,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   his entire personality.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   That's why we all have prejudices.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   There is no such thing as a detached, objective attitude.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   There is a saying to the effect,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   "As a man thinks, so he is."
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   It's equally true to say that as a man is, so he thinks.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I don't want to waste time with this,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   but I do trust that we're all clear about that.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   You know, the world is full of prejudice.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   It's not only true with regard to the gospel.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   It's true in every walk and department of life.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   I can't remember whether I've told you
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   how I read not so long ago
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   a review of Professor Arnold Toynbee's massive
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   History of the World,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   a study of history in great ten volumes,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   of great and learned authority.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   But I was reading a review of these massive tomes
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   by another professor of history,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   in Oxford.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   And this is what he said.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   He said, "Of course there's great learning
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   and great erudition shown in these great volumes."
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   But he said he didn't agree at all with the conclusion.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   He doesn't agree with the thesis.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   He said Professor Toynbee started off with a theory
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and with an idea,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   and what he's done is to manipulate the facts
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   and force them to fit in with his theory.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Now that isn't a non-Christian speaking about a Christian
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   or a Christian about a non-Christian.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   That's one professional historian
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   speaking about another professional historian.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   He says it's all right, of course,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   but what Professor Toynbee's been doing is this.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   His prejudice has made him make the facts
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   fit into his theory.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   And of course, exactly the same thing is true
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   of Mr. A.J.B. Taylor,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   who was saying that about Professor Arnold Toynbee.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   He has a different prejudice.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   You see, here are two great professors of history
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   looking at the identical facts.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   One says this, that other one says that,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   and they're diametrically opposed.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And yet we are asked to believe
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   that people are not Christians today
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   because with their detached, objective minds
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   and intellects, they can't accept it.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   My dear friend, it's got nothing to do with intellect.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Nothing at all.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   I'm not exaggerating.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   It has nothing to do with intellect.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   The fact that the same man at one time of his life
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   denied it and later believes it
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   proves it isn't intellect.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   It's something else.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And that is the state or condition
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   that even governs the mind
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   and insinuates a prejudice.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Very well, but I'm saying that this prejudice
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   manifests itself in certain specific respects.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   And I just want to show you three of them
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   as they're indicated very clearly
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   in this passage with which we are dealing.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Here's the first.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   This condition always brings up in our mind
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   the question of understanding.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Of course, you see, it's coupled with that idea of intellect.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Now there are large numbers of people outside Christ
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   and outside the Christian faith and the church tonight
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   because they say they cannot understand this or that.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   And because they don't understand,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   they say they will not believe.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   They say they cannot believe.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   They say, "I don't believe anything which I don't understand."
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   That's to commit intellectual suicide.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   If I subscribe to a thing, though I don't understand it,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I'm being a fool.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   What's the value of my brain, my understanding?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   They don't understand, therefore they reject.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   That was exactly the trouble with these people.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   You see, here was their problem.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Jesus, the carpenter, has come back.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   He's been away.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   He stood up and he read and he spoke and expounded.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And they were moved, they were impressed,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   they were shaken.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   They all bear him witness.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   But then they said, "But wait a minute.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   We've got to be rather careful here.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   We're being carried away.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   He's played on our feelings."
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   We were almost on the point of saying that this is the Messiah.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   He's Joseph's son. He's Jesus.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   They say the thing's impossible.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   When we first looked at him and when we heard him,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   we said, "This must be the long-expected Messiah."
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   But of course it can't be.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   How can this one person be at one at the same time,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   the carpenter, the son of Joseph,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   and the Messiah? Impossible.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And because they couldn't understand it,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   they rejected it and they rejected him.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   It passed.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Let's grant it was a tremendous problem.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Jesus, whom they knew so well,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   he'd been there all his life.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   And he had always been with them and had worked amongst them.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   But suddenly there's something different.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   He seems to be two men at one at the same time.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   But they say that sort of thing can't happen.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   He is Jesus. He's never been trained as a Pharisee.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   He hasn't got learning. He can't have
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   because he's never been taught.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   It's only Jesus, after all.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   And because they couldn't understand him,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   they rejected him.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   There is the whole case.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   It's still the same, isn't it?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   There are people who say, "I can't be a Christian
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   because at the very outset you confront me
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   with certain propositions that I can't accept
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   because I don't understand them."
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   You preach one called Jesus of Nazareth
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   and you ask us to believe that at one and the same time
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   he was man and God.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   You say two natures in one person,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   distinct, separate, in union but not intermingled.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And I don't understand a thing like that, says the man.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   I can't get this idea of two natures in one person.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Sounds monstrous to me.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   If you said he was a man, the greatest man the world's ever known,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   I'd follow him, I'd believe in him.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   But you ask me to believe he's God at the same time,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   that he's the everlasting Son of God
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   without beginning, coming from eternity into time.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   I can't believe it.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   I don't understand such talk.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And then they say you talk to us about miracles.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Your New Testament, your Gospels are full of miracles.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   You tell us that he could turn water into wine,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   that he could walk on the sea,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   that he could raise the dead and do various other things.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   I don't believe in miracles.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I'm a scientist, I've got a scientific mind.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I believe in cause and effect.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   And there are no such things as miracles.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   So I can't be a Christian, I can't believe.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I don't understand this claim of the miraculous.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   They don't understand miracles, they say,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   and therefore they cannot be Christians.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And then they say you always bring us to that cross.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   You have your communion service with your bread and your wine.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   You say this is the center of your message.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   You ask us to believe that that one man dying was dying for all,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   that the death of one summer bore the sins of many,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   and that summer by dying there upon that cross he was saving us.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   We don't understand things like that, they say.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   That isn't our idea of life, that's not our understanding
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   of human nature or the ways of men.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Oh, I mustn't keep you with these illustrations,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   but I'm mentioning the ones that seem to stumble so many.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And here's another. People say God's will.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I don't understand it. I don't understand His permissive will.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   At one and the same time you ask us to say and to believe
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   that God is love, and then I see spastic children.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I see wars and pestilences and famines.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And I can't understand these things.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   If your God is what you say He is, why does He allow things like this?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   I can't reconcile them. They can't understand this.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And many are stumbled even by the question of prayer.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   They say if God knows everything, what's the point of praying?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   What's the value of it?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Now if you want a technical term, what they say is this.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   There are these antinomies, these things which appear to be utter opposites,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   and yet you Christians, they say, you blend them, you make them one.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   You ask us to take them both together.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   The antinomies of the Christian faith.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   And men reject Him still as they rejected Him in the synagogue of Nazareth,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   because they don't understand.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Messiah and Joseph sung "Impossible."
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   What's the answer?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Well, the answer, my friends, could be a very long one.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   I'm only going to give you some headings.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Here is one. It's a very general argument.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And it is that life itself would be quite impossible and insupportable
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   if we didn't accept things that we don't understand.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   I mean by that something like this.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Do you understand the sun in the heavens?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Do you know all about it? Do you understand its working?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   The world is full of mystery.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   The whole universe is mysterious.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Sir James Jeans writes his book "The Mysterious Universe."
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Well, if you insist upon understanding exactly and in detail
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   before you're prepared to use anything or to have any benefits from it,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I say, and I'm not trying to be funny,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   if you press that argument to its logic, in a world like this, you ought to commit suicide.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Because you don't understand your universe and yet you go on living in it.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   But wait a minute, there's something much more important than this.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Isn't it obvious from the very beginning that this cannot be a matter of understanding primarily?
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   I'll tell you why I say that.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   If to be a Christian is primarily a matter of understanding,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   well then it is grossly unfair.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It's unfair for this reason.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   There are some people who are very clever, they're born with great brains,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   and they can take in knowledge, they can mop it up.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   There are others who can't, and they haven't got the time.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   They're perhaps working at home with a house full of children and a husband to look after
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   and the washing and the cooking and all the rest of it.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   If they are to understand to be saved, well I say they are lost, they're hopeless.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   If it were a matter of understanding, foreign mission work would be utterly monstrous and ridiculous.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   But thank God it isn't a matter of understanding.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   It isn't understanding that saves.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   It isn't my understanding of these great mysteries that saves me.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   It's my believing them, accepting them, and yielding myself to them.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Oh well, let me put it then like this.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Here is a very good reason why it isn't a question of understanding.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   The things about which I'm speaking are so great and so transcendent and so glorious
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   that no human understanding can possibly arise to them.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   If we can't understand electricity, how can we understand God and holiness and heaven
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   and the two natures in the one person and the three persons in the blessed holy trinity?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Oh, the apostle Paul with his gigantic brain comes to us and he says,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   "Great is the mystery of godliness."
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   He knew more about it than anybody else, but he didn't understand it.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   He bows before it, the mystery of it all.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Who can understand a thing like that?
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   It isn't to be understood, it's too great, it's too glorious, it's too transcendent.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Yes, and especially when you add this final point to it all,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   that our natures are sinful, and all our faculties are sinful.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Our minds are sinful.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   You see, we saw that last Sunday evening with this prejudice, this blindness,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   all seems yellow to the jaundiced eye.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   He can't help himself, poor fellow.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Everything isn't yellow, but he says it is.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Why? Well, the jaundice is in his eye.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Everything's colored. We're all like that.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   We're all tarnished by sin, our very minds are not functioning as they should be.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And yet with our sinful minds, we say, "If I don't understand God, I won't believe Him."
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Lunatic, monster of iniquity, fool that thou art.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   It is the fool that ever says in his heart,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   "There is no God," simply because he doesn't understand.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   But look at the tragedy of it all as you see it depicted in these people in the synagogue of Nazareth.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Because they don't understand the mystery of Jesus and Christ,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   man and God, the two natures in the one person, because they can't understand it.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   They try to murder Him and to get rid of Him.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Was there ever greater folly?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Was there ever a greater tragedy?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   My dear friend, just think for a moment, think reasonably and rationally,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   and see that you're doomed to failure at the very beginning.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   You'll never understand God, even if you go to heaven and gaze upon Him to all eternity.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   He is the absolute and the eternal, the all and the in all.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   But come, let me say a word about the second matter.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   These people were not only stumbled by the fact that they couldn't understand,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   they were obviously also stumbled at our Lord's actions.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   You see, He reads their minds.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   When they said, "Is not this Joseph's son?"
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   You remember what He said, this is what He said to them,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   "You will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in this thy country."
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   What's it mean? It means this.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   They had heard that He had been working great miracles in Capernaum,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   but He hadn't done so at Nazareth.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And they felt that He ought to have done so.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   He isn't doing what they thought He ought to be doing.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   They had heard about all this, so they were expecting miracles,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   expecting signs, and He didn't give them.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   And hence their annoyance and their final wrath.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   This was always a source of trouble, wasn't it?
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Did you notice what we read together after the seventh chapter of John's Gospel?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   His own brethren couldn't understand Him at this point.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   They said, "Look here, we don't understand you, Jesus.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   You say that you've come to manifest yourself, and yet you're hiding yourself."
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   They said, "Don't you know that this great feast of tabernacles is starting at Jerusalem?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Why don't you go up there?
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   If you've come to do what you say you've come to do,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   why not go up and declare yourself what you're staying here for?
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   We are going up, why don't you go up?"
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Even His own brethren felt He wasn't doing what He ought to be doing.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   They didn't believe in Him.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   It was the trouble with the whole nation of the Jews.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   He didn't seem to be doing what they thought the Messiah ought to do.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   They were always asking Him for a sign, for some marvel.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   The devil had already started it all there.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   You remember a way in the wilderness?
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   "If thou be the Son of God, command these stones that they be bred.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Give me a proof.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Let me take you to the pinnacle of the temple in Jerusalem,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   and throw you down, and God's angels will save you."
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   You'll give a proof by doing that.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Give a sign, and so on.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   They were always asking Him for a sign, so He said of them,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   "This wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   and there shall no sign be given it, except the sign of the prophet Jonas."
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Oh, another thing they expected was this.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   They'd got their great political ideas.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   They did not know when He came that He would be a great king,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   and that He'd collect a great army and lead them against their Roman oppressors
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   and set the country free again.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   But Jesus didn't seem to be doing it.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   He was spending His time in Galilee instead of being up in Jerusalem.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Indeed, we are told on one occasion,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   after He had worked the miracle of feeding the five thousand,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   they came and they tried to take Him by force to make Him a king.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   But He extricated Himself from them and went up into a mountain Himself alone.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Another occasion, you remember, He was preaching,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and preaching a very wonderful sermon,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   telling them about their relationship to God and God's love to them.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   And the moment He stopped to take breath, a man shouted out and said,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   "Master, speak to my brother that he share the inheritance with me."
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   And He turned to that man and said,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   "Man, who made me a judge or a divider among you?"
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   That man thought that He'd come to settle social problems
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   and be a materialist and a kind of politician,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   and a judge and a divider.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   That's what He ought to be doing, but He wouldn't do it.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Well, if you read through the pages of the four Gospels,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   you'll find that they've got many ideas as to what He ought to be doing
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   and what He ought to be saying, but He doesn't seem to be doing it.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And because He doesn't, they hate Him and they reject Him.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   "He ought to have been working miracles here," they said, "as well as there."
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   And because He doesn't, "What is this?"
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   It's still the cause of trouble.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   "I can't be a Christian," says someone,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   "because if your message is right and your Jesus is what you claim Him to be,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   why isn't He abolished war?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Why hasn't He produced universal peace?
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Your Gospel has been preached for nearly 2,000 years
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   and it doesn't seem to be touching this problem at all.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   You're always preaching about personal salvation and sin
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   and redemption and heaven and hell.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Why aren't you doing something about the present position?"
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   They want Christ to give them some sort of international peace.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   They think the business of Christ and of Christianity
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   is to deal with political situations and matters,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   that He is to speak on industrial problems and produce better relationships.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   They say, "Your Gospel doesn't seem to be doing anything.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   There are the problems. Why not tackle them?"
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   He doesn't seem to.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   It's still the same trouble, you see.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   But He doesn't do that kind of thing.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   When He was here on earth, He spent His time preaching to poor people.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   He spent a great deal of His time away up in Galilee.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   There He spoke to them and taught them and sat with publicans and sinners
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   He didn't set Himself up as king.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   He didn't start a political agitation.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   He didn't start a political movement.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   He did none of these things.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   He seemed to be hiding Himself always and everybody remonstrated with Him
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   and were trying to push Him to do something else and He wouldn't.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   He healed the sick.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   He gave comfort to those who were afflicted.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And then finally, instead of defying His enemies in apparent weakness
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and utter helplessness,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   He suffered Himself to be arrested and tried and condemned
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   and treated ignominiously and spurned and spat upon
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   and nailed to a tree and in utter weakness He died.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And they stood looking at Him and said, "He saved others. Himself He cannot save."
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   What's the value of all this preaching and all this talk?
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   He isn't doing what He ought to be doing.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   "If thou be the Son of God, save thyself. Come down from that cross."
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   But He didn't do it.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   So they said, "He claimed to be the Son of God and the Savior of the world."
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Monstrous and utterly ridiculous.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Ah, that has always been the stumbling block, hasn't it?
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   That has always been the offense.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Men think they know what Christ ought to be doing and He isn't doing it.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   He's doing something else.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   "Ah," they say, "your blood and your death and your sin. I'm not interested.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   I'm a practical man of affairs. I want to know what about peace and war and all these other matters."
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   But He followed His own way.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Miracles in Capernaum, not in Nazareth.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   He's got a plan. He's set a course. He follows it.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   He sets His face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   His own disciples try to plead with Him not to go.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   He said, "I must."
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Oh, it was like that while He was here.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And it was like that afterwards.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   There's an illustration of it all in the very earliest days of the Christian church,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   which I always feel is not only wonderful, but in a sense displays the divine humor.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Peter and John go up to the temple to pray.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   And there's a man seated at the beautiful gate of the temple, lame from his mother's womb.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   He'd never walked in his life, and there he is, begging alms.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   He's sitting on the pavement, paralyzed, with his cap by his side, expecting people to throw in something.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   And Peter and John come along there, going into the temple to pray.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   And he looked at them, expecting to receive something of them.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And Peter, looking at him with John, fastened his eyes upon him and said,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   "Silver and gold have I none,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   but such as I have, give I thee, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Rise up and walk."
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   He expected silver and gold.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   They say, "We haven't got it." But what we have got, we'll give. And they gave.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Whether you and I like it or not, my friends, the business of the Christian church
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   is not to deal with political and social questions.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   You may say to me, "Look at this man, Archbishop Makarios.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Why does he interfere in politics? Why doesn't he do his own job as a churchman?"
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   I agree a hundred percent with you.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   But with great respect, I would say the same thing to the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Chichester.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   I am not called to preach politics and social conditions.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   I am here to preach the gospel that my blessed Lord preached before me.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   A gospel of salvation.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   A gospel to the individual.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   You see, when you have settled the problem of Cyprus, you will still be a sinner.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   How easy to get excited about Cyprus.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   How offensive to have to face yourself in the life.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   How easy to wax eloquent about the sanctity of contracts between nations or groups of nations.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   But how offensive to be asked to face your own marriage vows
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   and your own personal purity and chastity.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   But that is what this gospel is about.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   I don't understand these great international questions.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   I am not commissioned to deal with them.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ came into the world, he tells us, to save sinners.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   He didn't come to be crowned as a king with a crown of gold.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   He came to be crowned with a crown of thorns.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   He came to die.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   He came to taste death for every man.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   He said the Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   He came deliberately to die, because it was only by dying for men and their sins,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   he could save their souls and reconcile them to God.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   These people were stumbled at that, men and women are still stumbled at it.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   And that brings me to my last point which I just mentioned.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   These people in the synagogue of Nazareth objected also to the idea of grace.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   You see, their whole approach to him was wrong, and that's why he spoke so severely to them.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   They felt that they had a right to make demands of him.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   They said, "Look here, you've worked miracles there, why don't you here?"
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   "They come with a demand, they present a bill."
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And he replies by making it very plain and clear to them,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   that as long as they're in that frame of mind and in that attitude,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   he has nothing at all to give them except condemnation, he puts it in this way.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   He said, "At the time of that great famine which lasted three and a half years,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   there were many widows in Israel,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   but God didn't send Elias to any one of them,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   he sent him unto a widow of Sarepta, a city of Sidon."
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And in the same way he said, "In the time of Elisha the prophet, there were many lepers in Israel,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   but God didn't send him unto any one of them, he sent him unto Naaman, a Syrian."
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   And Israel doesn't like this, but it isn't a question of what Israel likes or wants or expects,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   it is God who gives, it is God who decides.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   And by speaking as he did there at that point, our Lord is making that abundantly clear.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Look here, he said to his fellow townsmen of Nazareth,
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   "If you are making demands and saying, 'We have a right to this, I have nothing,'
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   didn't you hear me when I said just now," he seems to say,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   "that I have come to preach the gospel to the poor?
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   If you think you've got any claim upon God and his love tonight,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   you'll never know his grace.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   We are all sinners and we have no rights in the presence of God,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   we can't demand anything, we can't present any bill.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   That you come to him and say, 'Nothing in my hands I bring,'
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   simply to thy cross I cling.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Naked come to thee for dress, helpless look to thee for grace.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Foul I to the fountain fly, wash me, Savior, or I die."
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   If you come to Christ standing on your feet and presenting demands,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   you'll get nothing but what these people had in Nazareth.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   He'll rebuff you, he'll reject you, he'll condemn you.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   But if you come to him in utter helplessness and hopelessness,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   realizing your emptiness and woe, he'll give you everything.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   "Come unto me," he says, "O Lee, that labor and are heavy laden,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   and I will give you rest."
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   He invites the thirsty, the hungry, the sick, the hopeless, the helpless.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   If you come, I say again, standing erect in terms of demands and rights,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   you'll get nothing.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   And let us go to him, acknowledging that we have no claims, no rights,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   but that we have seen that we are sinners in the sight of God.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Let us emulate the example of the publican who went up into the temple to pray,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   and who was so conscious of his misery and his wretchedness,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   that he didn't lift up his face to heaven, but simply cried, saying,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   "God, have mercy upon me, a sinner."
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   That man went down to his house justified, not the righteous.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   Sinners, Jesus came to save.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Do you remember our Lord's parable of the workers in the vineyard?
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   The employer went out early in the day, he saw some men standing idle,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   he said, "Go and work in my vineyard, and I'll give you a penny for it."
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Off they went.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Hours later he went out again and saw another group,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   sent them in the same way and on the same terms.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   He went out at the eleventh hour, and there were still some men standing idle.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   And he said, "Why don't you go and work?
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Go in and I'll give you a penny."
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   And they went in and worked.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Then the time came, and the master went to pay them.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   And he called first of all those who had gone into the vineyard at the eleventh hour,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   and he gave them a penny.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   And then they came all in turn, and then came finally the people who had gone in at the very beginning.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   And he gave them a penny also, and they looked at him and they said,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   "Look here, what's this?
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   You gave a penny to the people who only worked for an hour,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   and are you only giving a penny to us who have borne the heat and the burden of the day?
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   How scandalous!" they said.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   "Look here, we must have more.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Five or six times what you've given them, even ten times."
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   And our Lord had to tell them the same thing.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   "Is thine eye evil because I am good?" he says.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   "Have I done you any wrong by being gracious to these lost?
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Can't I do as I like with my own?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   That's grace.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Did you know this, my friend, that if God were not a God of grace,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   every one of us would be damned.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   There'd be no hope for any, for we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   We've no right to ask anything.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   You've insulted God, you've ignored Him, you've put your will before Him,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   you've turned your back upon Him, He's told you in your conscience not to do something,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   you've done it deliberately, that's how you've treated Him,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   and you haven't thanked Him for your blessings, and yet you think you've got a claim upon Him.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   It is of God's mercy only that we are not all consumed.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   God can do as He likes with His own, and He will.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   His son worked miracles in Capernaum, not in Nazareth.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   Do you know why he didn't work miracles in Nazareth? I'll tell you.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   He knew the people, he knew their attitude,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   and he knew that unless that was broken down, there was no hope for them.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   If he'd worked miracles, they'd have stood on, admiring and expressing their criticisms.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   He knew the trouble, he had to break them down.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   And we all must be broken down.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   There is only one key, if I may so put it, that opens the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   It is the key of repentance.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   The key of the acknowledgement of sin.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   The key that makes a man say, "I have nothing, have mercy upon me."
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   That he finds irresistible.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   And he always responds and showers down of the riches of His grace.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   So may God open our eyes to the tragedy of rejecting Him because we don't understand Him and what He does.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Because He doesn't do what we think He ought to do.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   And because He asks us to come to Him as suppliants on bended knee, realizing our desperate need.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Amen.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
