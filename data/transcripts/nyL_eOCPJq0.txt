[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   The thing that leaps to mind about the use of the word Yahweh is passages like Isaiah 42, 8 where God
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.160]   says, "I am Yahweh, that is my name.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.640]   I will not give my glory to another, nor my praise to graven images."
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:24.320]   It's always seemed ludicrous to replace the name of God with something that's not his name in a
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.520]   sentence in which he says that is my name and the original has the word Yahweh and not Adonai.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.000]   And he seems to be making a point about it and saying I won't give my glory to another.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.360]   Right.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.720]   God's name and his glory are bound together.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.920]   His glory is who he is and his name is who he is.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.520]   And so when he says that's my name I'm not giving my glory to anybody else.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.560]   It would seem to me to be detrimental to the glory of God to change his name when he insists
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.640]   upon it so intensely.
