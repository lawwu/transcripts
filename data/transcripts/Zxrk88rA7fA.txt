[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040]   Hi, everybody.
[00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.800]   I'm Lucas.
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.200]   Welcome to my lab.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.120]   I feel weirdly proud of these weird projects
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.400]   I've done in my basement.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.120]   I think I'm better known for the companies that I've started.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.800]   The first one was Figure 8, which
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.520]   helped companies do machine learning by helping
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.920]   them get training data, which hopefully, after this video
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.400]   series, will make sense to you.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.360]   My new company, which I'm super excited about,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.040]   is called Weights and Biases.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.520]   And we're going to use it heavily in this video series.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.760]   It helps you visualize the performance of the models
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.160]   as they train.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.960]   I've been building machine learning
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.320]   models for like 20 years.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.560]   And I remember the first model I built was amazing.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.240]   It felt like almost like breathing life into a machine.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.440]   And I still feel that wonder when
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.480]   I build these models, which is why I still do it.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.480]   So I hope you guys take away some
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.800]   of the joy of machine learning in these classes.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.480]   I really love to teach machine learning classes.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.960]   I started doing it kind of out of frustration,
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600]   kept going to customers.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.200]   And they wouldn't know what to do
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.520]   once they had the training data.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.920]   So I started informally just showing them
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.320]   how to build models.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.760]   And then over time, I started teaching these classes.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.920]   But the problem with the classes is
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.720]   you can only teach a couple, maybe 100 people at once
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.040]   before it gets unwieldy.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.240]   And people have to fly to San Francisco to see the classes.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.520]   So I thought it'd be a cool experiment
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.080]   to put these classes online and see
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.480]   if we could teach the whole world to do machine learning.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.120]   So we're going to do topics based
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.680]   on practical applications.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.920]   So we're going to look at handwriting classification.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.800]   We're going to do apparel classification.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.400]   We're going to look at text classification.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.240]   And we'll do more topics as people request them.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.640]   My hope for this class is that you walk away
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.420]   being able to put machine learning into your projects,
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.680]   whatever that takes and whatever projects
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.180]   you happen to be working on.
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.000]   And we're going to keep creating these videos.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.040]   So you should probably subscribe so
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.840]   that you're the first to know when a new video comes out.
