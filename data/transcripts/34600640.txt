[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.620]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.540]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.420]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.740]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.300]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.260]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.740]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.780]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.020]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.540]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.700]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.980]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.900]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.900]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.580]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.280]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.500]   Listeners, Merry Christmas.
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500]   Merry Christmas Eve.
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.940]   I'm so excited to spend a few minutes with you today
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.700]   and hope that you will enjoy our time together
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.060]   as much as I enjoyed designing it for you.
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.400]   It's kind of your gift from "Everyday Educator,"
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.740]   from all of us at the "Everyday Educator" podcast,
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.720]   our gift to your family this Christmas.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.320]   A read aloud time, read aloud for you.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.120]   I hope that you will enjoy listening
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.820]   and thinking on your own,
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.820]   or that you will enjoy listening and thinking
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.560]   and talking with your loved ones this Christmas.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.560]   Most of all, I hope that you will recognize
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.080]   and harness the power of Christmas.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.940]   I wanna begin our read aloud time together this morning
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.900]   with a passage from Isaiah.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.180]   One of the prophetic writings
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.820]   that foretells the power of Christmas
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.820]   is in the book of Isaiah 9 in the first,
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.140]   oh, about seven verses.
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.340]   That's what I want to read for us today.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.500]   Isaiah is speaking to the Lord's people
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.720]   on the Lord's behalf.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.720]   He is speaking to those who are waiting for a Messiah,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.220]   who are waiting for a deliverer,
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.540]   who are waiting for a savior.
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.740]   They've been waiting a long time,
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.860]   and they have searched in, much like we do,
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.140]   a lot of the wrong places.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.380]   So listen to the words of Isaiah 9:1.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.460]   "Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.900]   for those who are in distress.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.220]   In the past, he humbled the land of Zebulun
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.680]   and the land of Naphtali.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.680]   But in the future, he will honor Galilee of the Gentiles
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.000]   by the way of the sea along the Jordan.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.020]   The people walking in darkness have seen a great light
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.020]   on those living in the land of the shadow of death.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.680]   A light has dawned.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.580]   You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.580]   They rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest,
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.520]   as men rejoice when dividing the plunder.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.460]   For as in the day of Midian's defeat,
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.860]   you have shattered the yoke that burdens them,
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.300]   the bar across their shoulders,
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.300]   the rod of their oppressor.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.420]   Every warrior's boot used in battle
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.840]   and every garment rolled in blood
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.640]   will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.060]   For to us, a child is born.
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.940]   To us, a son is given
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.020]   and the government will be on his shoulders.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.060]   And he will be called Wonderful Counselor,
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.060]   Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.300]   Of the increase of his government and peace,
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.660]   there will be no end.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.460]   He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom,
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.460]   establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.240]   from that time on and forever.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.240]   The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.660]   There is so much hope and so much excitement
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.700]   and so much peace in that passage.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.460]   Look at the transforming power
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.460]   in the change that Isaiah is foretelling.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.580]   Look, before this light dawns, what's it like?
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.680]   There's gloom.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.620]   It says in the very first verse, it's gloom.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.460]   There'll be no more gloom.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.340]   And what else?
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.980]   There's been distress, gloom for those who were in distress.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.380]   And in the past, those people of the Lord,
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.380]   they were humbled and they walked in darkness
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.640]   and they have been living in the land
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.780]   of the shadow of death.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.380]   They have been the recipients of warrior's boots
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.820]   and there has been blood that has flowed.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.980]   Things have been dark.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.980]   Things have been hard, but what's the transformation?
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.920]   What's the light that dawns?
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.980]   What happens?
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.320]   What will happen?
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.200]   For those living in the shadow of death,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.640]   a light has dawned.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   Out of the gloom, out of the distress, a light has dawned.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.020]   And this light is going to honor Galilee
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.540]   and it's gonna be a great light.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.540]   And you see that what God has done is enlarge the nation
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.820]   and brought joy, increased the joy of His people
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.800]   even more what He's done is shatter the yoke
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.720]   and moved the burdens.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.440]   This is so cool.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.040]   Unto us a child is born, not just any child, but a son.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.160]   The Son of God is given and look,
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.380]   the government will be on His shoulders.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.200]   All the responsibility will be on the shoulders
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   of someone else, will be on this baby, this Son of God.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   And the responsibilities and the burdens can be passed on.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.760]   And even more than that, that baby will grow to a man
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.840]   who can be called wonderful counselor, mighty God,
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.360]   everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   And peace may be the very greatest transformation
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.300]   that these people are able to realize.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:35.480]   That's a cool lesson for us to get from the scripture
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.280]   about the power of Christmas.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.040]   And the scripture tells us lots of truths.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.720]   And I encourage you and your family to look in the scripture
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   and say, what is the power of this gift
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.860]   that God sent to us?
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:59.120]   But you know, fiction can tell us truths as well.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.800]   Made up stories can tell us great truths
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   and share with us, bring us to an understanding
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.400]   as a story draws us in.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:21.480]   There is a powerful story of a changed life
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.920]   in a piece of literature you're probably very familiar with,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.880]   A Christmas Carol written by Charles Dickens.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.840]   There is a changed life.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   And so I want to share with you, not the whole story,
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.320]   we don't have that long together,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.000]   but I encourage you to read it with your family.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.960]   My family reads this aloud still,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.560]   and my children are 28 and 30.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.920]   But I'm gonna share an excerpt
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.960]   just so that we can get a hint of the power
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:00.880]   that the message of Christmas has to change a life.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.880]   And as we read, I want you to think about
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.200]   poor old Ebenezer Scrooge
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.040]   and how the message of Christmas was needed
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.520]   and how it changed him when it came.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.880]   I'm gonna read you first an excerpt
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.280]   from the very first chapter,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.520]   kind of sets the stage for our story.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:33.200]   Ebenezer Scrooge is a hardened businessman.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.720]   He is bitter, he is crotchety,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:45.840]   he is all about the money.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.080]   He's not a very cheerful person.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:55.160]   Listen, once upon a time of all the good days in the year,
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:01.480]   on Christmas Eve, old Scrooge sat busy in his counting house.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   It was cold, bleak, biting weather, foggy with all,
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.720]   and he could hear the people in the court outside
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.600]   go wheezing up and down,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   beating their hands upon their breasts
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.160]   and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.760]   to warm them.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.920]   The city clocks had only just gone three,
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.400]   but it was quite dark already.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.480]   It had not been light all day,
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.200]   and candles were flaring in the windows
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.080]   of the neighboring offices,
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.080]   like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.200]   The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.080]   and was so dense without that,
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.080]   although the court was of the narrowest,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.920]   the houses opposite were mere phantoms.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.520]   To see the dingy cloud that came drooping down,
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.360]   obscuring everything,
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.680]   one might have thought that nature lived hard by
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.120]   and was brewing on a large scale.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.880]   The door of Scrooge's counting house was open
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.560]   that he might keep his eye upon his clerk,
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.000]   who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.600]   was copying letters.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.360]   Scrooge had a very small fire,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.480]   but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.880]   that it looked like one coal,
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.160]   but he couldn't replenish it
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.600]   for Scrooge kept the coal box in his own room.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.920]   And so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.840]   the master predicted that it would be necessary
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.120]   for them to part.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.920]   Wherefore, the clerk put on his white comforter
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.400]   and tried to warm himself at the candle,
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.800]   in which effort, not being a man of strong imagination,
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.720]   he failed.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.760]   "A Merry Christmas, Uncle, God save you,"
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.000]   cried a cheerful voice.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.600]   It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.200]   who came upon him so quickly
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.800]   that this was the first intimation
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.640]   he had had of his approach.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.040]   "Bah," said Scrooge, "humbug."
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.080]   He had so heated himself with rapid walking
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.040]   in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's,
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.440]   that he was all in a glow.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.160]   His face was ruddy and handsome.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.600]   His eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.400]   "Christmas, a humbug, Uncle," said Scrooge's nephew.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.080]   "You don't mean that, I'm sure."
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.920]   "I do," said Scrooge, "Merry Christmas.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.200]   "What right have you to be merry?
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.640]   "What reason have you to be merry?
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.280]   "You're poor enough.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.120]   "Come then," returned the nephew gaily,
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.680]   "What right have you to be dismal?
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.520]   "What reason have you to be morose?
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.120]   "You're rich enough."
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.800]   Scrooge, having no better answer ready
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.520]   on the spur of the moment, said, "Bah," again,
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.680]   and followed it up with, "Humbug."
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.120]   "Oh, don't be cross, Uncle," said the nephew.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.920]   "What else can I be," returned the uncle,
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.080]   "when I live in such a world of fools as this?
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.320]   "Merry Christmas.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.960]   "Out upon merry Christmas.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.280]   "What's Christmas time to you
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.400]   "but a time for paying bills without money,
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.200]   "a time for finding yourself a year older
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.320]   "and not an hour richer,
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.440]   "a time for balancing your books
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.480]   "and having every item in 'em
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.440]   "through a round dozen of months
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.600]   "presented dead against you?
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.320]   "If I could work my will," said Scrooge indignantly,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.640]   "every idiot who goes about with merry Christmas
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.720]   "on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.960]   "and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.920]   "He should."
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.560]   "Uncle," pleaded his nephew.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.920]   "Nephew," returned the uncle sternly,
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.960]   "keep Christmas in your own way
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.760]   "and let me keep it in mine."
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.800]   "Keep it?" repeated Scrooge's nephew.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.600]   "But you don't keep it."
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.560]   "Let me leave it alone then," said Scrooge.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.040]   "Much good may it do you.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   "Much good it has ever done you."
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.480]   "There are many things from which I might have derived good
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.680]   "by which I have not profited, I dare say,"
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.920]   returned the nephew.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.160]   "Christmas among the rest.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.760]   "But I am sure I have always thought of Christmastime,
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.400]   "when it has come round, apart from the veneration
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.120]   "due to its sacred name and origin,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.680]   "if anything belonging to it can be apart from that,
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.680]   "as a good time, a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time,
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.480]   "the only time I know of in the long calendar year
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.680]   "when men and women seem by one consent
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.800]   "to open their shut-up hearts freely
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.280]   "and to think of people below them
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.680]   "as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.720]   "and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.320]   "And therefore, uncle, though it's never put a scrap
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.960]   "of gold or silver in my pocket,
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.320]   "I believe that it has done me some good
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.960]   "and will do me good, and I say, God bless it."
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.840]   The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.280]   Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.920]   he poked the fire and extinguished
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.000]   the last frail spark forever.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.160]   "Let me hear another sound from you," said Scrooge,
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.440]   "and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.040]   "You're quite a powerful speaker, sir."
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.120]   He added, turning to his nephew,
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.520]   "I wonder you don't go into Parliament.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.480]   "Don't be angry, uncle.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.840]   "Come, dine with us tomorrow."
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.440]   Scrooge said that he would see him.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.840]   Yes, indeed, he did.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.000]   He went the whole length of the expression
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.280]   and said that he would see him in that extremity first.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.040]   "But why?" asked Scrooge's nephew.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.840]   "Why?"
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.240]   "Why did you get married?" said Scrooge.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.560]   "Because I fell in love."
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.720]   "Because you fell in love?" growled Scrooge,
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.160]   as if that were the only one thing in the world
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.920]   more ridiculous than a Merry Christmas.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.040]   "Good afternoon."
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.800]   "Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.440]   "before that happened.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.800]   "Why give it as a reason for not coming now?"
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.280]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.040]   "I want nothing from you.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.480]   "I ask nothing of you.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.800]   "Why cannot we be friends?"
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.720]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.640]   "I'm sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.480]   "We have never had any quarrel to which I've been a party,
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.760]   "but I've made the trial an homage to Christmas
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.840]   "and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the last.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.800]   "So Merry Christmas, uncle."
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.600]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.040]   "And a Happy New Year."
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.040]   "Good afternoon."
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.480]   Now,
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:45.000]   Scrooge goes home, finally, through the day.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.840]   After having another group of people come and visit him,
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.560]   asking for money, seeking some help for the poor,
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.280]   Scrooge, of course, turns them down.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:05.320]   He wishes his workmen off and he goes home.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   And he has dinner in his usual melancholy restaurant.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:19.400]   He reads the newspapers and finally he goes home to bed.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.360]   And while he is preparing for bed,
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.720]   he is visited.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.000]   And some say he was visited by a dream.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Some say he was visited by the Spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.840]   Some say he was visited by the ghosts of Christmas past
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.040]   and Christmas present and Christmas future
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.040]   and each of these visitors to Scrooge on Christmas Eve
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.920]   try to teach him a lesson,
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.920]   try to turn his heart with the message of Christmas.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:12.560]   But Scrooge remains very resolute
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.960]   through all the sights, the memories that he sees,
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.240]   the present circumstances he's reminded of,
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.000]   his heart doesn't change.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.320]   And the final visitor, the ghost of Christmas future comes,
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:37.400]   or the ghost of Christmas yet to come, as Dickens calls it,
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:44.840]   he takes him on a journey and they stop at a churchyard.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.520]   And this is very near the end of the story.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:54.480]   He comes to a churchyard overrun by grass and weeds,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:02.760]   a burying place and the Spirit stood among the graves
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.000]   and pointed down to one grave.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   He advanced toward it, trembling, Scrooge did.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.160]   The phantom was exactly as it had been,
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.160]   but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.920]   "Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,"
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.720]   asked Scrooge, "answer me one question.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.720]   Are these the shadows of the things that will be
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:42.880]   or are they shadows of the things that may be only?"
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   "I think Scrooge's heart is turning, what do you think?"
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.280]   Still the ghost pointed downward to the grave
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.640]   by which it stood.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:22:00.640]   "Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends to which,
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:06.360]   if persevered in, they must lead," said Scrooge.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.120]   "But if the courses be departed from,
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.920]   the ends will change.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.920]   Say it is thus with what you show me," Scrooge is begging.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.600]   The Spirit was immovable as ever.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.680]   Scrooge crept toward it, trembling as he went
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.360]   and following the finger read upon the stone
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   of the neglected grave his own name.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.120]   Ebenezer Scrooge.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:45.120]   "Am I that man who lay upon the bed?"
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.040]   He cried upon his knees.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.480]   The finger pointed from the grave to him and back again.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.280]   "No, Spirit, oh no, no."
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.880]   The finger still was there.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.840]   "Spirit," he cried, clutching tightly at the robe.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.120]   "Hear me, I am not the man I was.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.800]   I will not be the man I must have been,
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.560]   but for this intercourse.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.760]   Why show me this if I'm past all hope?"
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:22.720]   For the first time, the hand appeared to shake.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.360]   "Good Spirit," he pursued as down upon the ground
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.560]   he fell before it, "your nature intercedes for me
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.720]   and pities me.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.440]   Assure me that I yet may change these shadows
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.280]   you have shown me by an altered life."
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.200]   The kind hand trembled.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.480]   "I will honor Christmas in my heart
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.760]   and try to keep it all the year.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.400]   I will live in the past, the present, and the future.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.280]   The spirits of all three shall strive within me.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.520]   I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.520]   Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone."
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.280]   In his agony, he caught the spectral hand.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.880]   It sought to free itself,
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.440]   but he was strong in his entreaty and detained it.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.200]   The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.560]   Holding up his hands in a last prayer
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.520]   to have his fate reversed,
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.880]   he saw an alteration in the phantom's hood and dress.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.880]   It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:46.600]   Yes, and the bedpost was his own.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.840]   The bed was his own.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.960]   The room was his own.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   Best and happiest of all, the time before him was his own.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.940]   To make amends in.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.520]   "I will live in the past, the present, and the future,"
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.840]   Scrooge repeated as he scrambled out of bed.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.000]   "The spirits of all three shall strive within me.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.480]   Oh, Jacob Marley Heaven and the Christmas time,
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.520]   be praised for this.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.520]   I say it on my knees, old Jacob, on my knees."
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:26.760]   He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.600]   that his broken voice could scarcely answer to his call.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.400]   He had been sobbing violently
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.800]   in his conflict with the Spirit,
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.360]   and his face was wet with tears.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.460]   "They are not torn down," cried Scrooge,
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.100]   folding one of his bed curtains in his arm.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.500]   "They are not torn down rings and all.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.320]   They are here, I am here.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.060]   The shadows of the things that have been may be dispelled.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.880]   They will be, I know they will."
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.580]   His hands were busy with his garments all this time,
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.160]   turning them inside out, putting them on upside down,
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.920]   tearing them, mislaying them,
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.020]   making them parties to every kind of extravagance.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.280]   "I don't know what to do," cried Scrooge,
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.520]   laughing and crying in the same breath
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.980]   and making a perfect lacoon of himself with his stockings.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.480]   "I'm as light as a feather.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.280]   I'm as happy as an angel.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.160]   I am as merry as a schoolboy.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.160]   I'm as giddy as a drunken man.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.520]   A merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.400]   Oh, a happy new year to all the world.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.920]   Hello there, whoop, hello."
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.680]   He had frisked into the sitting room
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.140]   and was now standing there perfectly winded.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.920]   "Oh, there's the saucepan that the gruel was in,"
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.640]   cried Scrooge, starting off again
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.580]   and going round the fireplace.
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.260]   "There's the door by which the ghost
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.720]   of Jacob Marley entered.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.240]   There's the corner where the ghost
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.480]   of Christmas present sat.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.000]   There's the window where I saw the wandering spirits.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.680]   It's all right, it's all true.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.480]   It all happened. (laughs)
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.400]   Really?"
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.100]   For a man who had been out of practice for so many years,
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.960]   it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.620]   The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.080]   "I don't know what day of the month it is," said Scrooge.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.400]   "I don't know how long I've been among the spirits.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.560]   I don't know anything.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.440]   I'm quite a baby.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.200]   Nevermind, I don't care.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.080]   I'd rather be a baby.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.560]   Hello, whoop, hello there."
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.200]   He was checked in his transports by the churches
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.520]   ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.520]   "Clash, clash, hammer, ding, dong, bell, bell, dong, ding.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:41.120]   Hammer, clang, clash, oh, glorious, glorious."
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.360]   Running to the window, he opened it and put out his head.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.360]   No fog, no mist, clear, bright, jovial, stirring colors.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.640]   Stirring cold, cold, piping for the blood to dance to.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.120]   Golden sunlight, heavenly day, sweet, fresh air.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.840]   Merry bells, oh, glorious, glorious.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.400]   "What's today?" cried Scrooge,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.000]   calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.280]   who perhaps had lordered in to look about him.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.640]   "Eh?"
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.780]   Returned the boy with all his might of wonder.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.280]   "What's today, my fine fellow?" said Scrooge.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.820]   "Today," replied the boy, "why, Christmas day."
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.120]   "It's Christmas day," said Scrooge to himself.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.240]   "I haven't missed it.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.840]   The spirits have done it all in one night.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.600]   They can do anything they like.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.000]   Of course they can, of course they can.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.840]   Hello, my fine fellow."
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.280]   "Hello," returned the boy.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.760]   "Do you know the poulterers in the next street
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   but one at the corner?"
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.080]   Scrooge inquired.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.440]   "I should hope I did," replied the lad.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.200]   "Oh, an intelligent boy," said Scrooge, "a remarkable boy.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.600]   Do you know whether they've sold the prized turkey
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   that was hanging up there?
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.200]   Not the little prized turkey, the big one."
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.760]   "What, the one as big as me?" returned the boy.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.260]   "Oh, what a delightful boy," said Scrooge.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.880]   "It's a pleasure to talk to him.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.060]   Yes, yes, my buck."
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.340]   "It's hanging there now," replied the boy.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.960]   "Is it?" said Scrooge.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.560]   "Go and buy it."
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.940]   "Walker," replied the boy.
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:16.920]   "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.200]   I am in earnest.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.440]   Go and buy it and tell them to bring it here
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.760]   that I may give them the directions where to take it.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.440]   Come back with the man and I'll give you a shilling.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.000]   Come back with them in less than five minutes,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.080]   I'll give you half a crown."
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.400]   The boy was off like a shot.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.320]   He must've had a steady hand at a trigger
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.440]   who could've gone, got off a shot half as fast.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.080]   "I'll send it to Bob Cratchit," whispered Scrooge,
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.600]   rubbing his hands and splitting with a laugh.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.900]   "He shan't know who sends it.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.460]   It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.460]   Joe Miller never made such a joke
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.500]   as sending it to Bob's will be."
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.620]   The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one,
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.180]   but right it he did somehow,
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.580]   and went downstairs to open the street door
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.720]   ready for the coming of the polterer's man.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.300]   As he stood there, waiting his arrival,
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.360]   the knocker caught his eye.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.360]   "I shall love it as long as I live," cried Scrooge,
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.620]   patting it with his hand.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.180]   "I scarcely ever looked at it before.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.580]   What an honest expression it has in its face.
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.140]   Oh, it's a wonderful knocker.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:26.980]   Here's the turkey.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.340]   Hello, whoop, how are you?
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.700]   Merry Christmas."
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.060]   It was a turkey.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.460]   He never could've stood upon its legs, that bird.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.580]   He would've snapped him short off in a minute
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.780]   like sticks of sealing wax.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.420]   "Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,"
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.420]   said Scrooge.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.100]   "You must have a cab."
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.820]   The chuckle with which he said this,
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.580]   and the chuckle with which he paid for the turkey,
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.340]   and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab,
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.820]   and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy,
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.940]   were only to be exceeded by the chuckle
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.980]   with which he sat down breathless in his chair again,
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.460]   and chuckled till he cried.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.040]   Shaving was not an easy task,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.620]   for his hand continued to shake very much,
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.940]   and shaving requires attention,
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.220]   even when you don't dance while you're at it.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.260]   But if he had cut the end of his nose off,
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.140]   he would've put a piece of sticking plaster over it,
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.560]   and been quite satisfied.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.660]   He dressed himself all in his best,
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.340]   and at last got out into the streets.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.180]   The people were by this time pouring forth,
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.060]   as he had seen them with the ghost of Christmas present,
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.620]   and walking with his hands behind him,
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:41.180]   Scrooge regarded everyone with a delighted smile.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.140]   He looked so irresistibly pleasant in a word,
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.020]   that three or four good-natured fellows said,
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.020]   "Good morning, sir, a Merry Christmas to you."
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.260]   And Scrooge said often afterwards
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.660]   that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard,
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.580]   those were the blithest in his ears.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.300]   He had not gone far when coming on towards him,
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.420]   he beheld the portly gentleman,
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.900]   who had walked into his counting house the day before,
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:11.220]   and said, "Scrooge and Marley's, I believe."
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.180]   It sent a pang across his heart
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.740]   to think how this old gentleman
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.300]   would look upon him when they met,
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.980]   but he knew what path lay straight before him,
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.480]   and he took it.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.660]   "My dear sir," said Scrooge, quickening his pace,
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.880]   and taking the old man by both hands,
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.940]   "How do you do?
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.620]   I hope you succeeded yesterday, it was very kind of you.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.420]   A Merry Christmas to you, sir."
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.780]   "Mr. Scrooge?"
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.700]   "Yes," said Scrooge, "that is my name,
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.840]   and I fear it may not be a pleasant one to you.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.460]   Allow me to ask your pardon,
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.500]   and will you have the goodness?"
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.640]   Here Scrooge whispered in his ears,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.980]   (imitates whistling)
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.820]   "Lord, bless me!" cried the gentleman,
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.620]   as if his breath were taken away.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:33:00.140]   "My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?"
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.100]   "If you please," said Scrooge,
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.520]   "not a farthing less,
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.260]   a great many back payments are included in it,
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.540]   I assure you.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:10.140]   Will you do me that favor?"
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:13.900]   "My dear sir," said the other, shaking hands with him,
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.660]   "I don't know what to say to such munificent,
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.940]   don't say anything please," retorted Scrooge.
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.280]   "Come and see me."
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.320]   "Will you come and see me?"
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.700]   "I will," cried the old gentleman,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.120]   and it was clear he meant to do so.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.200]   "Thank you," said Scrooge, "I'm much obliged to you.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.720]   I thank you 50 times, bless you."
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.640]   He went to church, and walked about the streets,
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.240]   and watched the people hurrying to and fro,
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.160]   and patted the children on the head,
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.800]   and questioned beggars,
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.080]   and looked down into the kitchens of houses,
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.680]   and up to the windows,
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.240]   and he found that everything could yield him pleasure.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.500]   He had never dreamed that any walk,
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.180]   that anything could give him so much happiness.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.100]   In the afternoon,
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.220]   he turned his steps toward his nephew's house.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.980]   He passed the door a dozen times
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.220]   before he had the courage to go up and knock,
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.540]   but he made a dash and did it.
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.820]   (knocking)
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.980]   "Is your master at home, my dear?"
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.440]   said Scrooge to the girl.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.460]   "Oh, nice girl, very."
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.040]   "Yes, sir."
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.260]   "Where is he, my love?" said Scrooge.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.020]   "He's in the dining room, sir, along with mistress.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.360]   I'll show you upstairs, if you please."
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.300]   "Thank you, he knows me," said Scrooge,
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.180]   with his hand already on the dining room lock.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:33.580]   "I'll go in here, my dear."
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.540]   He turned it gently,
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.820]   and sidled his face in round the door.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.140]   They were looking at the table,
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.140]   which was spread out in great array,
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.580]   for these young housekeepers are always nervous
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.640]   on such points, and like to see that everything is right.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.020]   "Fred," said Scrooge.
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.980]   Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.740]   Scrooge had forgotten for the moment
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.740]   about her sitting in the corner with the footstool,
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.140]   or he wouldn't have done it on any account.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.860]   "Why, bless my soul!" cried Fred.
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.260]   "Who's that?"
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.100]   "It's I, your uncle Scrooge.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.660]   I've come to dinner.
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.160]   Will you let me in, Fred?"
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.500]   Let him in?
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.540]   It's a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.940]   He was at home in five minutes.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.100]   Nothing could be heartier.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.260]   His niece looked just the same.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.260]   So did Topper when he came.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.780]   So did the plump sister when she came.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.740]   So did everyone when they came.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.940]   Wonderful party, wonderful games,
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.660]   wonderful unanimity, wonderful happiness.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.940]   But he was early at the office next morning.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.020]   Oh, he was early there.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.840]   If he could only be there first
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.820]   and catch Bob Cratchit coming late.
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.100]   That was the thing he had set his heart upon.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:47.940]   And he did it.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.380]   Yes, he did.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.340]   The clock struck nine.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.860]   No Bob.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.580]   A quarter passed.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.940]   No Bob.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.580]   He was full 18 and a half minutes behind his time.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.820]   Scrooge sat with his door wide open
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.460]   that he might see him come into the tank.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.460]   His hat was off before he opened the door.
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.300]   His comforter too.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.660]   He was on his stool in a jiffy driving away with his pen
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.760]   as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.060]   "Hello," growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.740]   as near as he could feign it.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.980]   "What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?"
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.540]   "Oh, I'm very sorry, sir," said Bob.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.300]   "I am behind my time."
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.480]   "You are," repeated Scrooge.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.740]   "Yes, I think you are.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.000]   Step this way, sir, if you please."
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.740]   "It's only once a year, sir,"
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.660]   pleaded Bob appearing from the tank.
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.220]   "It shall not be repeated.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.700]   I was making rather merry yesterday, sir."
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.460]   "Now I tell you what, my friend," said Scrooge.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.700]   "I'm not gonna stand this sort of thing any longer."
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.860]   And therefore, he continued leaping from his stool
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.940]   and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.280]   he staggered back into the tank again.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.780]   "And therefore, I'm about to raise your salary."
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.020]   Bob trembled and got a little nearer to the ruler.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.020]   He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it,
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.140]   holding him and calling to the people in the court
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.780]   for help in a straight waistcoat.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.860]   "A merry Christmas, Bob," said Scrooge
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.940]   with an earnestness that could not be mistaken
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.260]   as he clapped him on the back.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.820]   "A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow,
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.540]   than I have given you for many a year.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.340]   I'll raise your salary
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.900]   and endeavor to assist your struggling family
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.060]   and we'll discuss your affairs this very afternoon
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.220]   over a Christmas bowl of smoking, Bishop Bob.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.060]   Make up the fire and buy another cold scuttle
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.660]   before you dot another I, Bob."
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.540]   Cratchit, Scrooge was better than his word.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.180]   He did it all and infinitely more.
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.660]   And to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:55.780]   He became as good a friend, as good a master,
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.580]   and as good a man as the good old city knew
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.100]   or any other good old city, town, or borough
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.820]   in the good old world.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.500]   Some people laughed to see the alteration in him,
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.740]   but he let them laugh and little heeded them,
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.820]   for he was wise enough to know
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.900]   that nothing ever happened on this globe for good,
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.900]   at which some people did not have their fill of laughter
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.260]   at the outset.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.140]   And knowing that such as these would be blind anyway,
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:24.940]   he thought it quite as well
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.300]   that they should wrinkle up their eyes and grins
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.460]   as have the malady in less attractive forms.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.300]   His own heart laughed and that was quite enough for him.
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.820]   He had no further intercourse with the spirits,
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.980]   but lived upon the total abstinence principle
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.300]   ever afterwards.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.820]   And it was always said of him
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:48.020]   that he knew how to keep Christmas well,
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.380]   if any man alive possessed the knowledge.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.460]   May that be truly said of us and all of us.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.340]   And so as Tiny Tim observed,
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.940]   God bless us, every one.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.060]   There's some timeless truths there too.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.060]   There was a lot that Scrooge,
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.820]   a lot of transformation for Scrooge.
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.100]   There's definitely a before
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:21.820]   where he is a bitter, selfish, penurious man,
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.700]   fond of his own company.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:29.420]   And then Scrooge after, joyful, gracious,
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.600]   embracing fellowship and truly generous.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.800]   There's one more poem I wanna share with you.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.240]   And it's a poem by an author that you know
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.880]   and probably love, J.R.R. Tolkien.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.320]   Did you know he wrote a Christmas poem?
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.040]   This poem, "Noel" was written
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.400]   actually before "The Hobbit" was published,
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   but it was only discovered about 11 years ago.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.480]   It was found in a 1936 edition of "The Hobbit"
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.400]   of "The Tablet," a Catholic journal
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:11.120]   that was published in a Catholic schools journal.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:16.120]   And some Tolkien scholars found the poem in 2013.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:21.040]   And it really goes with our theme
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.520]   of the power of Christmas.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:27.520]   It shows the change that happened,
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.100]   not just in man, even in nature.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   When God above blessed us with that Christmas child.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:46.340]   This is "Noel" by J.R.R. Tolkien.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:52.120]   Grim was the world and gray last night.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.600]   The moon and stars were fled.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.540]   The hall was dark without song or light.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.540]   The fires were fallen dead.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:05.320]   The wind in the trees was like to the sea.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.040]   And over the mountain's teeth,
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.560]   it whistled bitter, cold, and free
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.560]   as a sword leaped from its sheath.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.480]   The Lord of snows upreared his head.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.500]   His mantle long and pale upon the bitter blast
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.740]   was spread and hung o'er hill and dale.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:26.000]   The world was blind.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   The boughs were bent all ways and paths were wild.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.960]   Then the veil of cloud apart was rent
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.020]   and here was born a child.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.480]   The ancient dome of heaven's sheer
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.760]   was pricked with distant light.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:50.760]   A star came shining white and clear alone above the night.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.820]   In the dale of dark in that hour of birth,
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:57.020]   one voice on a sudden sang.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.240]   Then all the bells in heaven and earth
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.800]   together at midnight rang.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.580]   Mary sang in this world below.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.000]   They heard her song arise or missed
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.960]   in or of a mountain snow to the walls of paradise.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.400]   And the tongue of many bells was stirred
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.640]   and heaven's towers to ring
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.680]   when the voice of mortal maid was heard
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.540]   that was mother of heaven's king.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.440]   Glad is the world and fair this night
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.000]   with stars about its head.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.740]   And the hall is filled with laughter and light
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.160]   and fires are burning red.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:42.060]   The bells of paradise now ring with bells of Christendom
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:46.120]   and Gloria, Gloria, we will sing
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:50.080]   that God on earth is come.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   May the Lord change you daily
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:01.700]   into the one he has designed you to become.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:07.920]   That is the power and joy of Christmas.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.940]   Merry Christmas, you guys.
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.520]   (gentle music)
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.580]   you
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:27.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
