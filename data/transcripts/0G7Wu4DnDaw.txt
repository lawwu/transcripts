[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   So today's deep question, how can I reinvent my life in four months?
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.000]   Now that four months number is not arbitrary.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.160]   If it is the beginning of September now, where does four months put us?
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.680]   September, October, November, December.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.680]   That means this overhaul process we're going to talk about
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.160]   will finish right around new year's.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.120]   So right around the time all of your friends are buying copies of James
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.560]   Clear's book and getting gym memberships, you'll already be done with doing a
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.960]   reinvention for the year and you'll be well into this new life, not just starting.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.000]   Now, not surprisingly for long time listeners of my show and viewers of my
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.360]   videos, I'm going to use the deep life stack framework to structure our
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.880]   discussion of how to reinvent your life this fall, but I'm going to be specific
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.440]   this time and we're going to have particular timelines, how long to spend
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.900]   at this layer, how long to spend at that layer, because I want this whole process
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.640]   to fit exactly within four months.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.680]   All right.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.000]   So with great trepidation, I'm actually going to do a little bit
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.880]   of drawing while we talk here.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.880]   So we can actually see the deep life stack that I am discussing.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.640]   So what I'm going to do here is bring up my drawing screen and we are going to
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.480]   draw ourselves a deep life stack and we're going to annotate it as we go.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.420]   All right.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.080]   So at the bottom of the stack is the discipline layer.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.840]   So I will actually write this on the screen with my almost
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.640]   calligraphy quality handwriting.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.200]   What do you say, Jesse, for those.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.960]   Looks pretty good.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.400]   For those who are, for those who are watching instead of just listening,
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.560]   what you're seeing is a master, a master draftsman.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.700]   All right.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.960]   And let me put a nice, I see here, let me put a nice box around that.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.360]   Okay.
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.820]   So let's start with discipline as the starting place.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.140]   So if you're new to the whole concept of the deep life stack, discipline
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.220]   is the place that we start.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.940]   All right.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.900]   So what are we going to do here?
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.420]   First thing I want you to do as part of your reinvention, as we start down here
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.660]   at the discipline layer of the deep life stack, I'm going to label this set up core.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.760]   So you want to get set up a place where you keep track of everything that's going
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.540]   to happen in this reinvention that follows.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.320]   So here are the habits I follow here are my disciplines,
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.660]   here are the systems I'm using.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.600]   This is going to grow, but at the very beginning of the reinvention, you set it up.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.460]   And really the easiest way to do this, if you don't already have digital things in
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.360]   your life that you check regularly is to print out your current collection of all
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.560]   the things you're committing to put it in a clear plastic sleeve, a protector, like
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.960]   you would put a page in to put inside a binder and just put it on your desk or
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.860]   the drawer next to your desk where you work every day.
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.660]   So you have a physical artifact.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.840]   And as we add things to this list of commitments, you will just grow this list.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.840]   So we want to set up that core location for everything we're about to do.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.920]   The other thing we're going to do when we're down here in the discipline
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.980]   stack is three keystone habits.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.780]   It's going to be step this early step.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.600]   All right.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.080]   So a keystone habit is a habit that you do every day.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.520]   It should not be trivial, right?
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.240]   So it shouldn't be look at my home jam every day, but it also should be tractable.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.440]   So it shouldn't be do 90 minutes of intense exercise every day, somewhere in between.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.440]   You have to put a little effort into doing it, but you can almost certainly
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.580]   succeed in doing this every day, even with schedules that vary with unpredictability
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.400]   and difficulty.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.520]   So let's start this reinvention.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.760]   Once you set up your core, I want you to figure out three
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.300]   keystone habits to put in place.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.000]   I'm going to say divide their subject matter, have one focus on your professional
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.200]   life, one focus on your health and fitness, and one be purely focused on something
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.240]   personal, optional, and high quality.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.080]   So this could be around reading or nature or meditation, something that has no
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.480]   instrumental value beyond just giving you a sense of quality or awe.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.920]   And what we're going to do here, as we move through this stack, I'm going to, at
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.840]   the end, I will show you how long to spend on each of these things.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.800]   All right.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.860]   So we're going to do the timing last, but I'm going to go through the steps first.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.100]   All right.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:36.000]   So let's go to the next stage of the reinvention, which is going to be value.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Values.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.920]   So we start with discipline.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.820]   Now we're going to values.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.360]   So we draw, oops, I'll make this blue.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.120]   All right.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.680]   So let me draw the box here again.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.680]   My draftsmanship is it's like watching, it's not unlike watching, uh,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.800]   Picasso draw the, the peasant's hands.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.480]   I think we can all, and also it's clear for people watching.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.560]   I have expert control over how notability works.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.860]   I definitely know what I'm doing here.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.240]   Okay.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.880]   Let's just write all I'm trying to do here for those who are listening.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.160]   I'm literally just writing the word values and drawing a box around it.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.080]   All right.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.000]   I'll get better at this.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.080]   All right.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.640]   Values.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.600]   What do we want to do here?
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.000]   The first thing is the reconnect.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.800]   I'm going to label this as reconnect.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.880]   It's going to be reconnect with your moral intuition.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.000]   So you're sort of reconnecting with what is important to you in your life, but
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.680]   also what defines a life well lived, regardless of circumstances, regardless
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   of specific accomplishments.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.600]   So when I say reconnect with your moral intuition, probably the right way to do
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.520]   this is to go back and reread something that you've read before that really spoke
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.480]   to you, perhaps a Viktor Frankl man search for meaning style book that really, at
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.440]   some point you remember grounded you in thinking, this is what's important in life.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.960]   This is a, this resonated with my moral intuition.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.000]   So try to find something that you have experienced with what's influential to
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.680]   you and go back to reread that to reconnect with these moral intuitions.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.960]   You might want to watch things as well.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.040]   If there's a particular documentary or movie that really touched you in that
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.600]   deeper way, go rewatch that as well.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   So you're reconnecting here with what is at the core of your value system.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.080]   Once you have done that as part of this reinvention, I'm going to
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.280]   write the word code here.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.280]   You want to write a first draft of your code.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.960]   You should have a personal code.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.920]   And the code is not just what you stand for and what you don't stand for, but
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.320]   you should think of it as a roadmap for how you approach your life through good
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.560]   and bad, how you approach your life during the hard times in a way that makes you
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.640]   proud, how you approach your life during the good times, this could be harder
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.200]   sometimes in a way that makes you proud as well.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.840]   So it's, it's a roadmap for living that lays out.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.560]   Here's what's important to me.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.160]   What I think it means to, to be a good person and live life while live, but
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.720]   also how you were going to apply that.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.360]   The sense of here is how I go through my life through good and bad.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.880]   That is your code.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.040]   And finally, as this step of your reinventions, I want you to put in place
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.560]   some number of rituals that regularly connect you back to your moral intuition
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.960]   that regularly reinvigorate that connection for you in a visceral way, way that you
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.400]   feel, this could mean a lot of things depending on what you're set up in life.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.040]   If, if you're religious, these rituals, you'll almost certainly be drawing from
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.240]   long standing religious rituals that are set up to do exactly that.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:47.320]   The five time a day, Islamic prayer, the daily Torah study in Judaism and so on.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.080]   If you're not religious, there's any other number of things you can do that.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   Once you know what's in your moral intuition, and once you have your code
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.360]   written down, that will reconnect you with this.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.880]   This could be, you know, every week you hike to this place that
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.880]   gives you a sense of natural world.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.600]   Ah, it could be meditation.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.920]   It could be a particular type of volunteering you do on a regular
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.880]   basis to sort of humble yourself and reconnect you to helping other people.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.720]   All of this can be written down your code, your rituals.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.440]   You can connect this all to what we set up in the first stage, that core
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.280]   document or folder, you have a place for this to go.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.360]   Okay.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.480]   So now we've moved through the value stack as part of our reinvention.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.680]   Remember, we will get to at the end, how long to spend on each of these.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.160]   Next layer.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.400]   So I'm drawing another box here.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.800]   Beautifully.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.920]   Definitely looks the same as the other boxes.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:48.360]   You get to the control layer of the deep life stack.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:55.960]   The control layer is where you begin to organize, make sense of and curtail
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.520]   the various obligations in your professional and personal life so
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:06.240]   that you have breathing room so that you have space to think, space to
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.280]   enjoy what's good about your life, freedom from the anxiety of overload
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.200]   and disorganization and freedom to actually experiment with new things
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   or important things you want to add to your life in the final
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.240]   step that's going to follow.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.040]   So at some point you do need to get control over everything in your life.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.720]   Or a lot of this other work is going to be for not because you'll be so short
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.160]   on time and overwhelmed and anxious that you won't really get to it.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.720]   So what I have here is three things for our reinvention.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.480]   First thing I say, multi-scale planning.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.440]   This is for your work.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:49.600]   So when it comes to your professional life, put multi-scale planning into work.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.680]   Get this executed.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.040]   This is where you have a quarterly or semester plan that you update every
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.200]   quarter or semester or season, whatever, three to four months.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.600]   You look at that plan every week and use it to create a weekly plan, your
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.640]   weekly plan, you're consulting your calendar, you're seeing what's actually
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.760]   on your plate that week, and you're looking then also at your seasonal
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.640]   semester quarterly plan for reminders of the bigger things you're working on.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.680]   And you write out longhand, here's my plan for the week ahead.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.200]   Okay.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.840]   Then you look at that weekly plan every day.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.600]   When you do a daily time block plan for the actual hours of your day.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.200]   I of course recommend my own time block plan or second week plan.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.760]   Time block planner, second edition, timeblockplanner.com, but you can use
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.120]   whatever you want, but your time block planning your actual day in consultation
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.040]   with your weekly plan, your time block plan every day is informed by your weekly
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.760]   plan, which is written every week, which is informed by your seasonal plan, which
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.680]   is updated every three to four months.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.800]   That's multi-scale planning.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.400]   And there's, you can watch, I have, we'll talk about it later in the show.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.560]   I think there's a question about it.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.160]   You can look at the time management video for my YouTube page at
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.280]   youtube.com/calendarportmedia.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:03.840]   So we won't belabor the details, but it puts you in control of your
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.960]   time and your professional life.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.340]   And gives you really clear feedback on what your current load of work looks
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.400]   like, how long things take, how well things fit, what's really killing you
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.820]   in your schedule, what's not so bad.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.720]   Multi-scale planning gives you all of that.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.760]   It will give you all that information.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.240]   I'm going to say, and I'm going to call this household planning.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.920]   And I'll put that in quotation marks.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.000]   Not everyone lives in a house.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.160]   But what I mean by household planning is getting some sort of basic system in
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.760]   place for your work outside of work.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.180]   I have to, I, when I use household in quotation marks, I'm thinking, you
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.340]   know, I got to clean the gutters.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.040]   We got to fix this hole that just got knocked into the drywall.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.560]   We have a problem with electricity.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.080]   You got to mow the yard, whatever these are.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.360]   Right.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   And in your, my car needs to be, the oil needs to be changed.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.800]   I need to go pick up a new parking pass for my neighborhood, all the stuff
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.640]   that's non-work related, but related to life outside of work, we want
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.720]   some control over that as well.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.520]   Now you don't need something as extreme as full multi-scale planning, but you
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.560]   should probably have full capture for your work outside of work, someplace
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.040]   where everything gets written down.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.640]   I would then suggest reviewing that capture system when you do your weekly
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:19.400]   plan for work and the weekly plan can now you can add to it a section for home.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.920]   Okay.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.120]   Let me look at the week ahead.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.320]   Let me look at all the things I've captured for non-professional tasks.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.360]   What am I going to do this week?
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.800]   And when things need to go on your calendar, put them on your calendar.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.040]   Okay.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.640]   I got to take the car to get the admissions inspection.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.840]   Let me, this is the right time to do.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.920]   It's going to be Thursday.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.360]   Um, let me move this meeting and put that there.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.840]   I'll put that on my calendar and let me protect Saturday, put a note, like I
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.160]   got to mow the yard and do some housework and let me get a big list of that.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.600]   So you're building a plan for the week that allows you to make some
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.120]   progress on the household things.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.900]   And you have this full capture system.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.960]   So if you jot down household tasks, when you shut down your work at the end of
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.680]   the day, you can put them in that system and trust it, I'm not going to forget
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.400]   the mow the yard, I'm not going to forget that I have to hand in this new
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.760]   medical paperwork to my kids school.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.460]   So full capture review.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.280]   When you do your weekly plan for work, add a household
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.800]   component to that weekly plan.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.080]   Now you're in some control of that work as well.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.680]   It's not a hazard.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.480]   It's not just organized and you're learning what's on your
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.000]   plate and how long it's taken.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.160]   The final thing I'm going to suggest here for this control step of our
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:30.440]   reinnovation, reinvention, not re-innovation, reinvention is using this
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.500]   information you learned about both your professional life and personal
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.800]   life to automate and curtail.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.380]   So one of the big advantages of having these systems, and this is crucial.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.540]   One of the big advantage of having these organizational systems is not that your
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:53.620]   goal is to try to fit more work into your life, this is the common barb made
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.020]   at this type of thinking of the only reason why you'd want to do multi-scale
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.380]   planning is so that you can work more.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.540]   And you probably watch a lot of hustle culture, YouTube videos,
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.300]   ah, but that's not why we do this.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.920]   We do this because we want information about how long things actually take
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.640]   control about how we spend our time.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.220]   And then we can use this information to make our life better, not worse
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.460]   to make it less busy, not more busy.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.460]   So this is why I say automate and curtail.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.320]   Once you know, here's what I'm doing each week.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.260]   And I have a fine grain control over it in my work and non-work
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.160]   you can begin to automate.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.220]   So for work, you say, here's something that comes up again and again, and it's
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.940]   taking up a lot of cognitive cycles.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.380]   And it's causing a lot of back and forth emails to deal with every week.
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.720]   Let me find a way to quote unquote automate this.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.800]   I created a Google form.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.380]   Everyone in my team knows they just fill in this information in that form by
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.220]   Friday, it automatically goes to a Google drive and I have a half hour set aside
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.200]   at the end of the day, every Monday to gather that information.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.820]   It's already in a useful format.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.360]   It takes me 15 minutes and I post the thing they need.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.760]   And now I've automated that work that happens regularly in a way
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.300]   that minimizes its footprint.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.540]   For your life outside of work, there's also often many ways to automate.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.000]   Once you see what you're spending your time on, you can say, okay,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.520]   how do I get this off of my, think of it as my ad hoc scheduling plate.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.420]   How do I get this work that I have to do all the time around my house off of the
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.600]   list of just ad hoc, random things that I have to remember to do.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:26.860]   So maybe I set up a biannual visit with the gutter cleaning company and I get
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.140]   that all arranged so I don't have to think about it.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.740]   They just come, they just do it.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.500]   That's set up.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.140]   Okay.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.060]   I'm kidding myself about raking the leaves.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.680]   I never really have time to do this.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.520]   I can work with a landscaping company.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.840]   This is just when they come.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.080]   Okay.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.060]   Here's something I always have to do with my car.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.860]   You know, let me, let me, let me find a mechanic I like that's nearby and I bring
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.580]   it, I put on the calendar when the oil change happens, now I don't have to think
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.280]   about it when I get there, I execute the more things you can have automated by
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.220]   which I mean, you do not have to remember and schedule on the fly.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.300]   The work will just happen either.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.460]   Actually automatically, or you will get to regular calendar reminders
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.740]   when you know the process, you know exactly what to do.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.220]   It is off of your plate of things you have to remember and schedule.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.160]   So that's what I mean by automate.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.340]   So now you're reducing the planning footprint of your life outside of work as
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:17.660]   well.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.080]   The other word I wrote down here was curtail.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.760]   And what I mean by curtail is get rid of.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.520]   So now when you know what's going on, you have this fine grain control over your
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.920]   time and you're getting this fine grain, detailed feedback on your schedule.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.380]   You see the problems and your work life.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.880]   You realize being on this committee is killing me schedule wise.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.120]   It's putting all these little meetings that eat up there.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.880]   There it's 10 people being scheduled and it's three meetings a week and they're
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.220]   short, but I have very little control over where they fall because we have to find
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.880]   an intersection that works for 10 people.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.940]   And it's just partitioning my days in a terrible way.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.220]   Let's take that off our plate.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.800]   Or if you're at home, it's like, okay, it's this one thing I'm doing in the house
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.880]   is taking me hours and hours and stressing me out.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.560]   You know what?
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.260]   I'm going to quit this thing over here and use that money to pay someone to do
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:05.620]   this.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:10.240]   Or it's this, uh, this involvement I have this, this community group I'm a part
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.420]   of.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.880]   This is really a killing my schedule.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.820]   If I just quit that one thing, this is going to open up all the space.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.400]   This is going to make a move.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.880]   This sports team to this sports team.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.440]   Saturdays are completely open now.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.400]   That's going to be a huge blessing.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.600]   So it's all about once you know how things are landing on your schedule and their
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.200]   impacts, you can be incredibly high impact and strategic about get rid of that, get
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.360]   rid of that and change this and get huge returns back.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.480]   That's much better than just getting overloaded and stressed out and randomly
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.000]   starting to quit things left and right.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.920]   So this is all what control is about.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.000]   I control my time so I can automate and curtail until my load is reasonable.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.640]   And now I have breathing room, breathing room to reinvent breathing room to
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.680]   appreciate the results of reinvention.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.320]   All right.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.400]   This brings us up now to the final.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.040]   Layer of the deep life stack.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:04.280]   Okay.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.560]   I finally figured out by the way, how to draw thicker lines.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.400]   This final layer is vision.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.240]   This is where you take in the typical deep life process.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:23.440]   This is where you take specific aspects of your life and you overhaul them to be more
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.240]   remarkable.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.440]   So now you have this great foundation of discipline, meaning that you have
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.800]   reinvented your identity as someone who is capable of doing things that have a long
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.360]   term reward.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.160]   Even if they're hard in the moment, you're in touch with your values.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.520]   So you have this foundation that can get you through the good and bad.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.760]   It's a compass that keeps you aiming in the right direction.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.360]   You have control over your time.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.400]   So now you have the ability to aim yourself in your energies and intentional
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:47.840]   directions.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.360]   And now you figure out where to aim it, how to take aspects of your life and make
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.160]   those aspects of your life remarkable.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:04.880]   So I'm going to put here, I'm going to label this here one small, plan one large.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:12.560]   So what I mean by this is during this final step of your four month reinvention, I
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.280]   want you to actually take an area of your life, preferably a non-professional area of
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.840]   your life, where you're going to do a full overhaul of that towards more
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.200]   remarkability. And I'll give you an example about this in a second, but you take some
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.000]   aspect of your life and you do a full overhaul towards remarkability.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.240]   And then you take one larger areas of your life.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:35.320]   And this could be like what you do for a job where you live and you begin the process
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.280]   of an overhaul there.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.560]   This could be one of these longer term overhauls that could take a year or two to
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.000]   really think through. But so you get a small overhaul completely done and a big,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.280]   exciting overhaul actually started.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.160]   All right. So, for example, let me give you an example of a small overhaul.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:20:00.000]   Let's say you decide my life outside of work, I need more life affirming interest or
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.200]   hobbies. Right. I want some aspect of my life that's unrelated to my job, but I wanted
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.520]   to be take it to a kind of a remarkable level, like a real remarkable in the sense
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.840]   that people will eventually remark this about me.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.240]   Oh, this is something that he really does.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.120]   So let's say just for the case of a case study, you decide I want to become a serious
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.440]   cinephile. I like movies.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.240]   What if I made movies and appreciation of movies a serious part, a serious part of my
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.800]   life? Well, what might that type of what might that type of overhaul look like?
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:36.160]   Well, it would be a mix of concrete steps that you actually complete, plus new habits or
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.680]   systems you put into your life that all lead you towards a vision of that part of your
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.880]   life that's more remarkable.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.520]   So I jotted down some ideas here.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.120]   So maybe say, OK, first thing first, I want to as a concrete step, I'm going to overhaul
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:53.920]   my basement theater, good TV, good sound system, get a Blu-ray DVD player, blackout
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.320]   curtains for the windows down there, the basement window so I can have a really good
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.720]   movie going experience.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   I'm going to invest some money in this and I'm signaling to myself, I take this
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.560]   seriously. Now I'm going to add a habit or system to my daily routine as part of this
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.040]   overhaul. So maybe I want to get into a twice a week I watch a movie schedule.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.960]   Maybe there's one evening I put aside for doing that and one extended lunch break or
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.520]   maybe it's two extended lunch breaks during the week.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.600]   Maybe you're working remotely.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.560]   Don't tell your boss. Forty five minutes, an hour, and you're able to get through one
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.920]   movie during the week and you have one evening you've set aside and sort of agree.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.120]   I don't do bedtimes that night.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.560]   You have one evening in a week that you watch a movie.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.880]   So this is like a new habit.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.440]   And maybe every week you have this habit of going to the library to return the DVDs or
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.720]   Blu rays that you rented and you get new ones to watch or you join.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.960]   The old fashioned Netflix, which still exist, you can still get DVDs and Blu ray in the
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   mail through that using the envelopes, right?
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.440]   So there we go. That's the system.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.400]   And then maybe you have the system that says, when I do this twice a week movie watching,
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.800]   I have to find three articles to read ahead of time.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.520]   And I read all three articles about the movie, maybe like two reviews and one longer
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.240]   article. So I sort of know what I'm looking at.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.360]   And in that way, I am I'm enhancing my knowledge.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.160]   All right. And then maybe as a concrete, a second concrete step, you say, I'm going to
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.280]   found an online course about film appreciation.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.520]   I'm going to take that. I'm going to take this online course, maybe as a couple of books
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.720]   I'm going to read. Right.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.480]   So what you've done here in this overhaul is you have some concrete things to accomplish
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.360]   and then a new systems that you're sort of getting into place.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.000]   New regular habits are getting the place.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.320]   In this example, when this is all done, you're going to find yourself in a place where
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.160]   you're watching movies on a regular basis in a good home theater.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.760]   You've studied film more than you had before.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.600]   You have a much better foundation and now you can see your appreciation really growing.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.960]   Then you might have a longer term goal.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.320]   OK, if I keep this up for three months, I'm going to join a local film club that meets at
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.200]   this local nonprofit arts theater.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.800]   And I'm going to definitely go and they have monthly meetings and watch movies.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.400]   And I'll have I do this for three months.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.480]   I'll be ready to join that.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.320]   That's an example of a small overhaul when you're done with this.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.240]   You have made this thing a much more remarkable part of your life and give this a year or
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.080]   two to unfold from here and people are going to look at you and say, yeah, this is one
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.120]   of the things we know about you.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.000]   You're really in the movies, it's a big part of your life.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.480]   You get a lot of satisfaction.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.560]   So imagine that on almost any area of your life, that's going to be the small overhaul.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.000]   And then you're going to think through a larger overhaul lifestyle, such a career
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.280]   planning style approach.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.400]   What is my ideal lifestyle five, 10 years from now look like?
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.680]   What are what is a major change I might need to make to get me closer there?
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.600]   And you begin scheming what would be involved.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.720]   And it might be, OK, I have to build a lot of new skills, I'm going to have to get
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.960]   promoted, I'm going to have to get the side business up to this certain size of income
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.040]   before I'm comfortable leaving my main job.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.560]   This could be a longer term overhaul, but you get that going.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.840]   All right, so how do we time all of this?
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.360]   How do we time all this?
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.880]   Because we have now quite a few different things I suggested and we need this all to
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.760]   fit into four months.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.360]   So I'm going to draw on the screen here a timeline.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:12.080]   All right, so be our four month timeline.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:18.840]   And I'm going to label this timeline with the relevant months.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:25.920]   So let's see, we got September, we'll imagine we're starting this in September.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.760]   And then we get October starts.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.000]   The November starts, then December starts, that brings us to January.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.440]   All right. So for those who are listening, I have four months written up on the screen.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.520]   All right, so let's think about how long should we be spending on each of these things?
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:51.880]   I had actually I dropped the page that had my notes, I had to go get that.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.080]   OK, so let's start with discipline.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.520]   I'll use yellow here on our timeline to mark that.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.120]   So remember, in discipline, you set up your core and got three keystone habits up and
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.320]   running. I'm going to suggest that we just take the first two weeks for this.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:10.440]   I've marked the first two weeks on our calendar just for getting some keystone habits
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.200]   up and running your core system up and running.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.920]   All right. Next comes values.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.200]   I'll use a different color for this.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   So remember, you have to reconnect with your moral intuition.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.440]   You have to get a code going.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.160]   You have to get a regular ritual going that reminds you on a regular basis about this
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.240]   moral intuition. Here, we're going to put aside four weeks.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:35.680]   So on our schedule here, we're going from mid-September to mid-October.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.120]   All right. So the next layer here was control.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.280]   I'll use a different color here.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   Now we have a multi-scale planning, getting going your professional life, some sort of
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.120]   household capture and planning system and a stepping back after a little while of doing
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.040]   this and doing some automation and curtailing.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.080]   I think we need four weeks for this as well.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.360]   So I have mid-October through mid-November marked on here.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:05.720]   All right, because it's going to take a few weeks, you might want to spend two weeks on
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.920]   the business, one week on the personal life, and then give yourself a week after that of
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.640]   learning from the system, so starting to make some decisions.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.760]   And we're left now with the vision piece.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.960]   We're going to do a complete small overhaul of an area of your life and plan out a larger
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.600]   overhaul. And I'm going to mark on here the final six weeks.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.480]   So overhauls can take some time, so we'll give ourselves six weeks.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.280]   So if we look at this correctly, this gets us from September to January, moving through
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.480]   all four layers of the deep life stack, doing specific things at every layer.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.880]   By January, if you do this, it will be a pretty significant reinvention of your life,
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   especially if you are starting right now from a place of shallowness, by which I mean a
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.320]   life in which you are somewhat unanchored.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.240]   You're being pushed around by digital technology in your life outside of work.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.920]   You're just looking at your phone and are being dragged along emotionally by whatever
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:03.080]   is being shown on social media as the big thing to be upset about or not or having
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.800]   drool inducing distraction in your professional life.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.320]   It's just email and Zoom all day.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.680]   You're generically busy.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.840]   Don't even know what it is you're doing there.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.680]   If you're caught in the shallows of the digital.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:22.200]   The aimless digital, you do four months, go through the stack once in the way I
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.440]   recommend, you're going to feel a lot more freedom.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.040]   You're going to feel more in control.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.840]   You're going to feel more grounded in what matters to you.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.880]   You're going to feel like not only have you overhauled part of your life, but that
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.600]   you have the capabilities to keep going.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.920]   And pile remarkability upon remarkability.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.840]   All right.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.600]   So forget New Year's.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.760]   Fall is the time to reinvent.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.280]   And that is my four month plan for reinventing your life by the time we get to
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.760]   2024.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:56.640]   So for yourself, were you you've kind of already done this exercise before, but will
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.240]   you tweak some things or?
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.880]   Well, what I do is I start this process typically late June.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.920]   Right.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.680]   So I time it to my birthday, which is late in June, because I figure why not get started
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.360]   when I'm in the middle of summer and it's pretty slow.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.720]   So I'm usually hitting the ground running by the school year and I'm hoping by
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.560]   October to have my overhauls all in place.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.960]   So I start this a little bit earlier to take advantage of how slow the summer is.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.760]   But the point is, it's all aimed towards right around the fall is when I'm going to
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.000]   have some some big changes in place.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.080]   So I have a bunch of changes I'm working on right now.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.400]   A lot are in place.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.520]   A lot were done over the summer.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.240]   The, the ones that are not done yet, I'm hoping by October, November, they'll be
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.640]   locked in.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.000]   I mean, I don't want to be thinking about this stuff in January.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.160]   I want to be rock and rolling in January.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.280]   That's typically the way I see it.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.240]   For some of your small overhauls, do you have, do they just pile up on each other or
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.320]   they come to completion and then you add a new one?
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:58.920]   Um, so the way I have it written now, for example, so if you were to look in my, uh,
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.880]   semester plan, what you're going to see is the way I've broken this up for the things I
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.360]   still have to do is I have immediate and soon.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.000]   So it'll be okay.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.720]   Immediately.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.600]   That means these are things I want to get done.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.560]   And this is broken up in different areas of my life.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.760]   These are things I want to get done as soon as I can.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.960]   And so when I'm building my weekly plan each week as part of multi-scale planning,
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.080]   I'm saying, okay, let me see if there's some of these I can accomplish this week or
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.240]   make a lot of progress on.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.560]   Cause I'm trying to get through these as quick as possible.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.440]   For some of these areas, I have something labeled soon, which is don't work on it
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:30.800]   right now.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.400]   But when you're done with the immediate things for most of these areas, here's a big
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.320]   project to think about getting going next.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.280]   And they tend to be the few things I have labeled as soon or a little bit broader, a
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.360]   little bit more ambitious.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:49.240]   And so I want to get the immediate things done as quickly as possible and then plan
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.440]   some of these more ambitious ones.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.560]   So, so I do have right now, that's the way I'm breaking it up is the final soon things
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.240]   I want to get done.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.960]   Uh, and then the more ambitious now, actually the summer I did it two phases.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.080]   I had a phase of this.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.280]   I did when I was up in New Hampshire for the summer and then have another phase I'm
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.520]   doing for the next couple of months.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:09.480]   So I sort of broke up because some things really were relevant to being back here in
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:09.880]   DC.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.760]   And so I waited for those part of my annual overhaul reinvention.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.160]   I waited until I was back and some things actually being up in New Hampshire and away
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.040]   from DC, that was the right time to do them.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.600]   So for those I worked on them on the summer.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.720]   So right now this is what's left in different areas of my life.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.200]   Uh, soon combination of habits and one-time things to accomplish.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.400]   I mean, immediate, I should say habits and one-time things to accomplish.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.720]   And then soon, uh, projects to do next once those are done as well.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:44.320]   So for example, uh, overhauling the office, the maker lab office in our HQ, uh, under
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.040]   one of the areas of my plan is a soon.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.960]   So it's like, I'm not doing it right now.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.120]   There's a couple more immediate things I'm doing in that area of my life, but
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.920]   that'll be the soon.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:57.640]   So in theory, by like October, I'll be pretty serious about, okay, let's, I said
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.280]   my weekly plan.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.320]   I want to make progress on this.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.160]   Let's get someone out.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:00.840]   Let's hang the thing.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.880]   We'll do whatever we're going to do.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.000]   So just to, um, just to make that kind of more concrete, uh, another place where
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.240]   that's useful is fitness stuff.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.920]   This will often happen because, you know, September can be busy.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:16.120]   So it's sometimes I'll do something like right now, here's what I'm going to do for
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:21.480]   six weeks or eight weeks, just to make sure that, uh, I'm exercising, I'm moving,
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.160]   I'm outside, I'm lifting things.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.280]   But as I get into the rhythm of the semester, maybe six to eight weeks from now,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.600]   uh, and I'm used to this, then I'm going to upgrade and do a, you know, two or three
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.760]   months of something more intense.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.400]   So that's another thing you might, there's a, there's an easing into more intense
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.520]   efforts that can happen as well.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.040]   It's like, let me get used to doing something new in my life on a regular basis.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.440]   So I think about this as being a key part of my life, and then I can upgrade it later
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.800]   to now, let me get really intense about what that thing is, because often making
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.920]   something a regular part of your life, that's the really hard step.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.400]   Upgrading that once you're committed to it, it tends to be not as hard.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.520]   So that's another thing I'll do as well.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.600]   All right.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.400]   So let me give you the lay of the land for the rest of the show.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.360]   I want to move on now and do some questions, all of which will orbit more or less
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.840]   around this general topic of reinventing your life, the deep life, the deep life
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.360]   stack, anything about trying to improve major areas of your life to escape the
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.440]   shallows and get more depth.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.800]   I'm going to, we have five questions that orbit that theme.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.360]   And then in the final segment, I want to do a cover reveal for my new book and
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.440]   tell you a little bit about why I made such a drastic change in how that book
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.560]   cover actually looks.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.920]   So you want to stay tuned for that.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.560]   First, however, I want to talk about one of the sponsors that makes this show
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:44.040]   possible, and that is our friends at Cozy Earth Bedding.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:51.560]   So as I've mentioned on this show many times, my wife and I are massive fans of
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.720]   Cozy Earth, the Breezeable temperature regulating bed sheets.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.800]   This is a brand that made Oprah's favorite things five times in a row.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.360]   We love them.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.720]   We originally got a pair for free when we were considering having Cozy Earth be a
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.120]   sponsor and we liked it so much.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:13.280]   We went out and bought more pairs so that we wouldn't have to have time without the
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.080]   sheets while we were washing the main pair.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.160]   I will say this is probably one of the things high up on the list of things I
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.760]   missed when we were up in New Hampshire for the summer was our Cozy Earth sheets.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.440]   They really, really are comfortable.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.680]   I really do like them.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.720]   Now, if you don't agree, if you try them and don't think you're sleeping cooler
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.280]   and more comfortably, they will refund your purchase price plus shipping.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.440]   No questions asked.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.280]   You have a hundred nights to try them out.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.000]   You're not going to return them, however, because they are super comfortable sheets.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.960]   I mean, they're made out of viscus, which is a substance removed, taken from bamboo
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:52.720]   that gives them incredible comfort, but also is very good for not trapping heat.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.640]   So for a limited time, you can save up to 40% on Cozy Earth.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.520]   That's not nothing.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.400]   These aren't cheap sheets.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.080]   So this 40% is critical.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:06.480]   If you go to CozyEarth.com that's C O Z Y earth.com and enter my
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.320]   promo code, deep questions at checkout.

[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.960]   that's a pretty significant discount.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.320]   So you'll save up to 40% now, if you go to CozyEarth.com and use the promo code
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.280]   deep questions, try the sheets for a hundred nights.

[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:31.560]   That's CozyEarth.com promo code deep questions.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:38.040]   Also want to talk about our friends at Shopify, the commerce platform that is
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.680]   revolutionizing millions of businesses worldwide, whether you're a garage
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.960]   entrepreneur or an IPO ready company.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.200]   Shopify is the only team tool you need to start run and grow your
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.920]   business without the struggle.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.120]   Shopify puts you in control of every sales channel.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:01.800]   So whether you know, you're selling really comfortable sheets or I don't
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.000]   know what we would sell, Jesse.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.200]   I think, I don't know.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.520]   What would people want to buy from us?
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.640]   Oh, we had a coin idea.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.880]   Didn't we like Ryan holiday did with you can buy the Minto Mori.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.800]   I actually, okay.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.880]   So I have an idea.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.400]   Will you Shopify to sell this?
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.160]   I found a logo, a slogan for our coin.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:19.800]   We're going to sell.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.080]   So Ryan holiday, the, the, the stoic popularizer sells a coin that says
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.920]   momento more, remember death so that you'll hold it and remember to sort
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.520]   of live each life to its fullest.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.760]   Um, I have to remember the Latin.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:37.360]   I learned this from Susan Casey's new book, the underworld about deep sea diving.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:44.840]   And there's a, uh, a motto that means, um, in depth knowledge.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.960]   So in the deep knowledge, and it's something like, uh, in, I
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.200]   can't remember the word, but it's a Latin phrase, uh, something like
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.480]   a BSO or something, Cogito, right?
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.760]   It's not exactly that, but I figured that's what should be on our coin in depth.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:06.480]   Like, so like in the depth, in the deep knowledge, I'd be really cool.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.240]   That'd be a good coin.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:12.320]   And then just, uh, me on the, me on the coin, I guess, like thumbs up.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:12.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.000]   Anyways, if we were to sell something like that, which I'm sure would be very
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   successful, we would do Shopify because this is what Shopify does.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.960]   If you have a business and you want a super professional e-commerce setup,
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.320]   that's really easy to do.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   You use Shopify.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.680]   You've probably used it all the time.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.800]   You might not even realize it.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.400]   You just think, Hey, I, there's a lot of things I've bought from people where it's
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.000]   been a really good e-commerce solution.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.840]   I bet 80% of those have been Shopify, Shopify customers.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.160]   Uh, it really does make it easy.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:49.480]   They have an incredibly professional e-commerce experience with your, uh,
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.280]   with your audience.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.160]   I mean, look, Shopify has the internet's best converting checkout.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.080]   So not only is it very easy to use, it will help you convert.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.120]   Customers are potential customers to actual buyers.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:00.720]   We're going to need that.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.080]   Jesse, if we're going to convince people to buy our coin, but I think
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.600]   people will, if we use Shopify.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:12.680]   So sign up for a $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/deep.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.920]   Keep in mind, that's all lowercase deep lowercase.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.560]   So go to shopify.com/deep to take your business to the next level today.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.440]   That's shopify.com/deep.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.760]   All right.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.000]   Well, while we daydream about selling our incredibly lucrative coin,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.680]   figure we do some questions.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.280]   So who do we got first, Jesse?
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.000]   Hi, first question from multiscale planning amateur.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.440]   Is it hard to implement multiscale planning all at once?
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.120]   Is there a step-by-step plan similar to the deep life stack for
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.880]   gradually implementing this system?
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.800]   Well, a timely question since we talked about multiscale planning and the
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.760]   deep dive earlier in this episode, as I often do, because my systems
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:03.160]   are way too complicated, I have to start by critiquing our terminology here.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   Multiscale planning is not a separate entity from the deep
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.720]   life or the deep life stack.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.800]   It's actually something that you are likely to implement as part of the
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.680]   control layer of the deep life stack.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.360]   So it's actually a little bit recursive.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:25.880]   So we can't say use a deep life stack approach to implement multiscale
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.720]   planning because actually the deep life stack approach might include
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.920]   implementing multiscale planning.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.520]   This is all to say my systems are too complicated, but let's
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.400]   get to the meat of this.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.760]   So multiscale planning, we talked about earlier, quick reminder, you
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.400]   have three different timescales at which you plan, season, week, day.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.200]   You update the season every season, you update the week every week, looking
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.760]   at the season when you do so, you update the day every day, looking
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.680]   at the week when you do so.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.000]   So everything gets connected back.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.880]   Is there a way to break this up to ease your way into this type of planning?
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:02.880]   One way to do this, I suppose, is start with daily time block planning.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.880]   That's the hardest discipline of all this is because it's not only you do
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.400]   it every day, but it is how you run your work day.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:14.440]   So it's the, it's the biggest change you're going to see in your day-to-day
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.440]   experience of your work from the whole multiscale planning philosophy is going
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.160]   to be doing that daily time block planning.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.320]   There's no way to break that up.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.400]   You just need to do it.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:28.280]   Now, if you want to help convince yourself, I'm a daily time block planner.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.160]   I'm really giving this a try.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.360]   That's why, you know, I do sell that planner because it really helps
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.680]   people signal to themselves.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.840]   I'm doing this.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.400]   I spent 20 something dollars on this.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.920]   At least I'm going to try this for a while.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.400]   So if you need a kick, you can look at time, block planning.com and find that
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.560]   planner time, block planner.com probably, or do it in a notebook or however you
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.400]   want to do it, but just get going with daily time block planning after you've
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.200]   done that for a week or two, and you've sort of get the feel of it and you're
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.040]   seeing the benefits, then you can add in the weekly seasonal planning.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.320]   And I'm going to tell you though, that's going to be easy because the time
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.800]   footprint of weekly seasonal planning is small.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.880]   It's not that hard to do.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.440]   Weekly planning takes 30 minutes.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.240]   Seasonal planning, you're doing what three times a year.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.560]   So it's not going to be hard to add that.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.280]   The hard part is the daily time block planning.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:18.880]   So you can either just jump right in and do all three or daily time block plan for
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.760]   a week or two before adding in the other two elements, but don't be, don't be
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   intimidated by multi-scale planning.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:32.520]   It's not something that's going to require you to spend hours fiddling with systems.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.640]   It's streamlined and you are going to, it has an addictive quality to it.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.760]   It's very hard to go back from time block planning once you're used to it, because
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.120]   a non-time block day then feels chaotic and stressful.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.720]   So it has this chemical self-reinforcement.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.440]   And then once you're doing time block planning, it feels good to have the weekly
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.480]   plan, and once you're weekly planning, it has good to look at the seasonal plan.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.920]   So I would say just get started, start with time block planning,
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.560]   add the other elements soon.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.640]   All right.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.520]   What do we got next, James?
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:58.800]   All right.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.640]   I just about to call you Jamie.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.720]   It's all good.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.800]   Who do I have in mind, Jamie?
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.760]   That's Rogan's producer.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.240]   That's right.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.600]   Is that his name?
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.840]   Next question is from Philip.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.280]   I find that occasional unstructured work sessions create a sense of play
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.840]   that helped drive my creativity.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.240]   In my case, one night a week, I'll typically go through my code and make
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.880]   small tweaks like code formatting or do experimental work, such
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.320]   as trying new color schemes.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.920]   The result is that I end up more focused on my deep work sessions because I know
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.840]   that I have separate time when my mind wandering is allowed.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.440]   Is this something that fits into your deep life framework?
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.480]   I think it's a really good idea.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.160]   Does it fit into the deep life framework?
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.800]   Well, everything kind of does, right?
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.440]   So again, I guess I would place this as something you might experiment with in
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.760]   the control layer of your deep life stack, because that's where you really put in
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.640]   place the systems that help you take control over what's on your plate
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.240]   and keep things reasonable.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.640]   But let's really look at this strategy because I like it.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:13.520]   I like this idea of having non deep or non intense sessions for your deep work
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.920]   style of work that compliment the more intense deep work sessions.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.880]   So Philip is a programmer.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.760]   So he talks about, he has programming time where he's not really writing
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.920]   code, but just doing all the other stuff that a programmer might fiddle with
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.720]   when working on code.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.840]   So formatting things and changing configurations and their editors.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.160]   And then he has completely separate sessions where I'm actually trying to do
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.200]   the intense cognitive thing of writing code.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.080]   So I don't know if I would use the terminology unstructured or structured,
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.120]   maybe I would do preparatory and focused.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:46.640]   That's maybe a better way of thinking about it.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.560]   But I think it's a really good idea because as we know, there is a cost to
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:57.480]   cognitive context shifts and even within a given activity, just that shift from
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:03.840]   wandering fiddling mode to I'm serious about what I'm doing mode can be really
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.800]   significant. And we see this with a lot of work.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.600]   If you're a writer, this is really easy.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.040]   You can fall into Internet research mode and it's very hard to get back into
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.440]   crafting sentences mode.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.960]   You can get into trying to get a formatting thing proper for the article you're
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.160]   writing. Like, why is this block quote not quite right?
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.280]   And it's hard to get back into the sense crafting mode.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.760]   Certainly, we see this in brainstorming.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.440]   Let's say you're brainstorming a product or business strategy.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.960]   As soon as you're looking at the features on the fancy smart whiteboard that you're
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.120]   using. You lose that thread of momentum of trying to think big thoughts.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.720]   That's because really hard focused thinking gets your entire mind oriented around
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.360]   this one thing you're doing and you're holding the relevant variables and
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.800]   information in your working memory and using those to try to move forward down
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:54.520]   the path of critical intense cognition.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:59.040]   As soon as you start messing with that context and putting other stuff into those
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.680]   working memory, working memory variables.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:06.760]   Once you start loading up other context in your brain, you lose that thread.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.000]   The proverbial man falls off of the high wire.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.640]   So I think this is a really cool idea.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.600]   And so we're going to make the suggestion systematic.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.240]   What is Philip actually suggesting here?
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.720]   For intense, deep work, have unrelated sessions, not touching the deep work session.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.920]   For preparation and fiddling.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.560]   So if you're a programmer, have a session where you're looking at your code and
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:31.360]   formatting things or reminding yourself of where you're going to write and where you
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.880]   need to write the new section of code.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.680]   If you're a writer, you have everything set up.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.560]   This is a good time to get your research in order.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:41.000]   You could have a session where you find, OK, what are all the articles I'm going to
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.440]   need to cite for these next few paragraphs I'm going to write for this magazine
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.120]   article? Let me go get those and put them nicely
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.720]   into the system and pull out the quotes.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.520]   And then you're done with that.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.160]   You're done with that.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.280]   And then later you sit down to write code and that's all you do.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.560]   Later, you sit down to write the paragraphs of that magazine article and
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:58.840]   everything's there and that's all you do.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:05.960]   I think that's a really good strategy when it comes to particularly intense, deep
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.480]   work. So I like that unstructured preparatory deep life.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.160]   All right, cool.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.120]   So now we've got a question from James.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.080]   Maybe that's what I saw, Jesse, when I called you, Jamie.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.960]   I'll call James on the next page.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.200]   All right, next question's from James.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.480]   When I started college, I had a clear major in mind, but quickly changed to another
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.440]   subject that I find more interesting.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.800]   But I'm constantly thinking about what else I could do.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.760]   More recently, I'm thinking about getting into a completely different field.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.640]   I daydream about it frequently and often find the possibility very exciting.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.160]   I'm worried I'm going to fall into a pattern of forever quitting.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:49.360]   Well, James, I can say there's all sorts of alarm bells that are going off right now.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:58.280]   As I read your question, you, my friend, are deeply tangled into what we call the
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.320]   passion mindset.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:05.360]   This terminology is from my 2012 book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, which was
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.960]   basically a book all about this issue that you're facing right now.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:13.120]   In fact, the motivation for that book was dealing with college students switching
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.080]   their majors all the time.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.840]   So we're really in the territory that I spent a lot of time thinking about.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.600]   So what is this passion mindset?
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:24.680]   It's the mindset that says you should focus a lot on what the current thing you're
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:31.160]   doing, whether it is an academic major as a student or a job as a non-student, you
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.120]   should focus on what the current thing you're doing offers you.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:39.720]   And you should be really worried, is it offering me enough or is something else
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.080]   going to offer me even more?
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.240]   So am I loving this major or would that major, I'm going to, that's, I'm really
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.080]   going to enjoy that more.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.080]   Is this job really letting me, is it giving me the things I really love to work on or
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.200]   would another job have a different setup where I would get even more excitement out
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.800]   of it or even more fulfillment out of it?
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.640]   So it's constantly thinking me, me, me.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.960]   What's being offered, what could offer me more?
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:06.720]   This is a very dangerous mindset, especially when it comes to your professional
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:06.960]   life.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.400]   So beginning with the majors you choose and then with the jobs you choose after
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.360]   that, and it's dangerous for exactly the reason that you are experiencing in your
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.320]   own life.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:20.680]   Because the answer to what is this offering me is always less than something else
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.080]   could be.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.960]   And so if you're a student, you're going to start changing your major.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.560]   Why did you, why are you changing your major?
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.840]   Because what happens is as you move through your major, the courses get harder,
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.800]   harder courses are less fun.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.000]   And then your mind says, this must not be my passion.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.480]   Let's switch.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:35.960]   And guess what?
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.600]   The new major is going to get hard too.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.280]   And you say, well, this is not really my passion, but maybe this one is.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.040]   Same thing will happen in your job.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.000]   I'm not, I don't really love this.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.960]   And I'm spending a lot of time doing this, which is not my favorite.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.720]   I really want to have more autonomy.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.320]   I'm going to quit.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:48.880]   Let me try this one.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.960]   Well, this is not quite it either, but that job, that job is going to be the key.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:55.640]   It's constant anxiety that you are not doing the right thing, which leads to
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.520]   constant quitting and shifting, which has all sorts of negative consequences.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:04.760]   What you need to do instead, James is lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.480]   We talk about this all the time, but you fix a clear vision of what you want your
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.560]   life to be like five or 10 years from now.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.880]   This is a vision that captures all aspects of your life.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.840]   And it is visceral.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:16.760]   What does it feel like?
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.320]   Where are you?
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.160]   What do you see?
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.280]   What do you hear?
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.640]   What's the rhythm of your day-to-day life?
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.320]   It's not just work, but what's happening in your life outside of work.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.480]   What, when you see in a magazine or a documentary or a
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.800]   book has resonated with you.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   Oh, I want that in my life.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.480]   I want that in my life.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.280]   You want this really clear vision of the aspects of your ideal
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.800]   lifestyle five to 10 years from now.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.640]   And then you work backwards from that and say, how do I move my
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.280]   life in that direction when you're doing lifestyle centric career planning?
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:46.320]   You're freed from the pressure of all that matters is what
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.560]   I choose to do professionally.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.920]   That is the sole arbiter of how happy I feel, how fulfilled I feel in my life.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.040]   Your work instead becomes instrumental.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.120]   It's one of the levers you have to pull to move yourself
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.440]   closer to your ideal lifestyle.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.160]   And once you start seeing your major and then the work that your major
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:09.240]   enables through this lens, you become less worried about, is this the right
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.280]   thing for me, because what is the right thing for you now, it is something I
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.600]   can leverage to get closer to my ideal lifestyle, not is it perfect?
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.640]   Not, is it my passion?
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:21.560]   So now you can apply the alternative to the passion mindset to your work, which
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.720]   is what in my book, I call the craftsman mindset.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.160]   So if the passion mindset says, what does this job offer me?
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.800]   The craftsman mindset says instead, what can I offer this job?
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.360]   And it turns your focus towards how do I get better?
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.920]   How do I get more invaluable?
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.560]   How do I make myself indispensable?
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.760]   How do I build up what I call in my book, career capital, the metaphorical
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.880]   substance you acquire as you become better and better at things that are rare
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.520]   and valuable, because that is your leverage to shape your life.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.720]   That is your leverage to shape your work towards the things that resonate
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.080]   in a way from things that don't.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.760]   That's the thing that allows you to shape your work towards what's going
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.800]   to get you closer to your ideal lifestyle.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.840]   What can I offer my job?
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.480]   What can I offer my professors in my classes?
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.240]   How can I stand out?
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.720]   How can I be the best in this class?
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.440]   That is the route, the building of a filling life.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.440]   Now it's really hard, right?
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.760]   Because you have to put your head down and do really good work and build up career
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.800]   capital, then have the courage to leverage that capital and not just follow the
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.720]   expected path that that career path has.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.280]   You have to have clarity and vision about what you want your life to be like, but it
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.520]   frees you from the high stakes decision of one choice, what I do for my major, what I
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.840]   do for my work, it frees you from that one choice somehow being all important.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:38.880]   Once you have a vision for your ideal lifestyle, there are any number, any
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.640]   number of different professional paths you could use as the foundation for
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.320]   building yourself closer to that goal.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.920]   The choice doesn't matter that much.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.400]   What happens is what you do.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.360]   Once you actually have that work.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.520]   Now, one thing I might suggest if this is troublesome to you, right?
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.280]   Because you're young when you're young, you haven't lived that long as an adult yet.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.560]   So every year feels like a big portion of your life.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:05.240]   If you're having a hard time with this idea of I just took this major, this major is
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.000]   going to lead to this job.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.440]   It's going to take me a couple of years to build up some career capital here.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:13.560]   If that feels stultifying to you, you can be focusing during this period of heads
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.600]   down craftsman mindset in your job.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:20.400]   You can be putting a lot of attention to the other parts of your life as well and
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.240]   turning those towards the remarkable.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:28.320]   You know, maybe you're, you're hiking all of the high peaks in the white mountains
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:32.560]   or you're training for some sort of athletic event, or you get really into
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.760]   movies or building up some sort of community center.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.320]   You can find other aspects of your life that you can push towards the remarkable
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:43.440]   much quicker while going through that slow I'm 23 and just building up my
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.880]   reputation and skills phase of your professional life.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.400]   But the key here is to be working backwards from a vision and applying a
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.520]   craftsman mindset to get yourself forward towards that goal.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.640]   And you got to escape this passion mindset.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.560]   The grass will always seem greener.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.680]   But the thing is, if you keep popping fences to the next field, you never have
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.760]   time to actually enjoy the ground that's right there under your feet.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:10.880]   I actually did some events, Jesse up at, um, Dartmouth this summer
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.720]   on so good, they can't ignore you.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.560]   So it's been a while since I really got into that career mode.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.880]   Uh, but there's a couple of events I did where that's what
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:18.880]   they wanted to talk about.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:23.960]   There's a lot of people and, uh, one grad student there had this great old copy of
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:28.160]   so good, they can't ignore you where the cover had faded so much that you
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.440]   could barely see the words on it.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.320]   That's great.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:30.800]   I signed it.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.680]   I was like, yeah, that's it.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.480]   And he still was like, look, I've been using this for the
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.040]   last decade to shape my life.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.160]   Did you have to read the book again to remember all the key ideas?
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:38.960]   I remembered it.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.560]   I even did an event on one of my student books.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.400]   Those are getting pretty old now.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.920]   Now we're talking 2005, 2006.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   I remembered though.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.200]   I was going to say that would count for one of your, uh, four, five books a month.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.400]   How to win at college.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.400]   That's going to count as one of my five books.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.520]   Oh, I can't go back and reread my own books.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.280]   All right.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.360]   Let's, um, let's do a couple more.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.120]   What else do we got here?
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.040]   Next question's from agent three zero.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.920]   I graduated with an MA about five years ago, but despite some good interviews, I
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.880]   haven't been able to land a job in my field and have therefore spent the last five
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.600]   years consistently underemployed.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.120]   Since discovering the ideas associated with the deep life, I've been trying to
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:25.000]   pursue my goals in a more disciplined way, focusing on methodically progress,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.400]   progressing and skill building.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.200]   However, I feel like my mind doesn't fully trust the approach based on slow
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:34.040]   productivity, because in the back of my mind, I feel like it's going to come too
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:34.920]   little too late.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.200]   Well, okay.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.880]   I'm worried here as well, uh, because I'm seeing hints of the same passion mindset
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:46.280]   that we were talking about with the last question.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.920]   So I looked at the extended version of your question.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.120]   What I learned from it is this last five years where you've been trying to
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:57.800]   methodically progress and skill build, you have been pursuing those five years.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:02.120]   What you've been methodically building towards is this idea of some sort of ideal
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.520]   job that matches your academic training.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.680]   And you have this vague idea that I have this arts degree.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.600]   I should be, you know, in some sort of arts job because that's why I got this
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.120]   degree and I don't want it to go to waste.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.560]   What I'm going to say is that's not working.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.760]   There isn't a easily accessible, ideal job for you.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.640]   You spent five years trying to do it.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.680]   So the slow productivity approach here is not be slow in terms of trying to find
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.000]   work, the slow productivity approach.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.720]   That's a mindset that says when you're working on specific accomplishments, be
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.040]   okay with that taking time, make steady progress on it, work at a natural pace,
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.080]   try to make it really good.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.680]   But when it comes to finding a job, you need a job.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.760]   Now, I think Lifestyle Centered Career Planning is going to help you here, remove
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.960]   the concern about just finding a job that works because what you really need here
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.440]   is something that is going to reward career capital if and when you build it
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.760]   with autonomy and opportunities.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.280]   There are many different jobs.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.360]   You have a master's degree, so you're just generally an educated person.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.160]   There's many different jobs you can likely find that will offer you those
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:07.760]   attributes.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:12.720]   They might not have any connection to the specific arts topic you studied, but
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.520]   there's something that you can use as a foundation towards building towards your
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.400]   ideal lifestyle.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.080]   So I would say right away, blank slate, five-year lifestyle.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.560]   What are all the aspects?
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.400]   Nail that down.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:29.440]   Next, figure out, okay, of jobs that are actually accessible to me now, which is
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.400]   going to be the best foundation on which to build towards this ideal lifestyle.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:37.200]   Keep in mind, it might have nothing to do with your degree and then you need to
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:37.880]   get into that job.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:42.040]   It's going to take you one or two years, probably of heads down craftsman
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:45.520]   mindset, career capital acquisition, skill building.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:50.400]   This is where you put in this energy, not trying to find a job, not trying to make
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.000]   yourself generally useful to the job market.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.960]   It's once you have a job, once you actually have a job that is going to reward
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.080]   you becoming so good, you can't ignore you with more autonomy and opportunities.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.120]   That's where you put your head down because you can very specifically be
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:08.760]   building the exact skills that that job will specifically you have evidence for
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   reward.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.520]   So we've got to leave the passion mindset of, like, if I just keep working on my
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:18.760]   skills and trying, I'll find this perfect job and get a job and then kill that job.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:23.360]   And when I say kill it, I mean kill it at that job, do really well and use that as
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.160]   leverage to get towards an ideal lifestyle.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.080]   So you really should have a five-year plan here where the next two years in your
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:33.800]   professional life are becoming undeniably great at something that you do, not
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:34.960]   sweating what that thing is.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:40.680]   And again, like I talked to you with the last person in the last question, you can
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.640]   outlet some of this deep life energy towards other aspects of your life relevant
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.160]   to your vision of the ideal lifestyle.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.840]   Parts of your life have nothing to do with your work.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.240]   Focus on those as well.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:55.000]   So you don't feel like you're just confining your world to just be being very
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.520]   reliable and good and learning the specific skills that the particular company
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.720]   needs. You can work on these other aspects of your life as well.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.280]   But you need a job.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:05.000]   You need a job before slow productivity matters.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.320]   You need a job before becoming so good you can't ignore you makes sense because
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.200]   there's got to be someone who's paying attention.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:14.320]   There's got to be someone that is looking at and cares about how well you're
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.080]   actually doing.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:20.240]   So find a good enough job and start moving today towards your five-year vision of a
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.680]   more ideal lifestyle.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:25.280]   All right, let's do one more question, Jesse.
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:25.960]   I think we have time.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.080]   Yep.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:31.840]   Next question is from a new, what advice would you give to people with depression
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.720]   so they can realistically reach their goals for a deep life?
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.160]   Well, I knew it's a good question.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:43.080]   I've talked to multiple people about this, not on the show, but but over email.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:48.200]   The first caveat, of course, is this is not my area of expertise.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.480]   So whatever advice I give here is not going to apply to everyone.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.200]   So take that take everything I'm saying with a grain of salt.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:55.640]   All right.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:01.680]   First thing first, before you get into any specifics about the deep life or how you
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:05.760]   want to go through a reinvention of your life, if you're dealing with depression
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.160]   symptoms, you want professional help for it.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:16.360]   Depressive symptoms are often the result of disordered thinking, disordered thinking
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:22.000]   about yourself and your life, ruminations that happen with an intensity and anxious
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.400]   ferocity that they're not easily tamed.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:30.240]   A ruminations that have become so draining and anxiety producing that they
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.600]   ultimately begin to short circuit.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:38.560]   The circuits of your brain that give you excitement or hope or energy, they put in
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.720]   their place, a sort of severe a hedonic stupor.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:47.160]   This is really a difficult thing to deal with just on your own.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.760]   Therapy helps you fix this.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.920]   Let's start reordering your thinking.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:58.760]   Let's start moving the ruminative pathways out of their deep grooves so that we can
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:04.160]   begin to rebuild some of these other circuits that allow for other types of more
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.680]   hedonic subjective experience.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.360]   So you need professional help with that.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:12.000]   And you want to get that help as the foundation for anything else.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.480]   All right.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.440]   So let's put that, let's assume that you're doing that.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:20.360]   What I've heard from other people who deal with various mental health issues of this
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:25.080]   type is that the deep life, the way we talk about it here on this show is actually
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:25.760]   pretty useful.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.000]   It's actually pretty useful because the way we talk about the deep life on the show
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.040]   is very structured and process based.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:36.360]   And what's difficult if you're coming from a place of depression or just from a hard
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:41.800]   time is if you have a definition of success, if your definition of what you're trying to
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:47.600]   do is based on either a really positive subjective feeling, like I just want to feel
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.080]   great.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:53.360]   Or very concrete accomplishments, you know, like I just want to be the best and win and
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.080]   get the best job and have all the money.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.440]   And I'm just going to feel good every time I have that accomplishment.
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.800]   That's a really bad yardstick, especially if you're dealing with something like
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.280]   depression, because you're not going to feel good or you will sometimes.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.440]   So it's often out of your control.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.760]   And if that's the goal you're looking for, then it's just going to create more
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.160]   rumination. Well, why don't I feel good?
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.840]   And if you need very particular types of really intense professional accomplishments,
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.200]   well, that's really hard, too, because those are hard to get.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.080]   And actually, if you're depressed, they can be even harder to get because it's the
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.920]   amount of just I'm willing to just do 15 hours a day becomes really difficult.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.520]   When you have anything else difficult going on in your mind, so then you're going to
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.840]   be self-incriminating and that'll make it worse.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.120]   The deep life structure, by contrast, is not it's not about a specific feeling or a
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.720]   particular accomplishment.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.120]   It's about intention. Let's build up some regular discipline in our life in a
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.000]   tractable way. Once we have this regular discipline in our life, let's get in touch
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.520]   with what really matters to us and have a code by which we live through good times
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:54.240]   and bad. So even just at that layer of the deep life stack, this already is a big deal
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.240]   for a lot of people who are adrift in the shallows and also dealing with mental health
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:03.120]   issues is having a code that you believe in, that is grounded in your moral intuitions
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.840]   that says this is what we do even when times are bad and we can have pride in that.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:11.360]   It's incredibly powerful as opposed to why don't I just feel good?
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.400]   All right, then as we move up the stack, well, you get to something like control.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.280]   I just have control over what's on my plate so I don't feel disorganized and anxious.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:26.280]   That's useful. More importantly, the automation and curtailing aspects of control
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.160]   allows you to say, you know what, this is a hard time coming.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.360]   And people I know who are dealing with depression often talk about waves.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.320]   You feel it coming on and then there could be an extended period that you didn't leave
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.680]   from. If you have the control stack in place, when you feel a wave coming on, this is
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.920]   going to be a hard winter.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.760]   You have the levers to pull, to pull back from things in a way that's going to make
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.800]   things more tractable.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.400]   OK, I need to Catherine May wintering mode here.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.840]   Let me pull back, pull this back, stop doing this.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.000]   You have that control allows you to pull back in a systematic way.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.840]   Very useful when you have up and down mental states.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.440]   And then finally, get to that plan for the remarkable, just building things in your life
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.480]   that are remarkable, regardless of how you feel.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.320]   It gives you a sense of efficacy, gives you a sense of autonomy and adds really
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:24.000]   interesting, self-initiated, persistent sources of value into your life that
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.120]   themselves are like a beacon that shines bright amidst the dark fog, which is the
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.960]   depressive syndrome. So I think all aspects of the deep life stack can be really
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.320]   useful to work through, even if depression is an issue.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.800]   It'll take longer maybe than someone that's, you know, all Adderall and focused on high
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.800]   energy and whatever.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.400]   Sure, who cares? It takes the time it takes and you have to take breaks for him to come
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.360]   back to it. Fine. Do that.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.520]   I don't care. But you're slowly building these stacks and then working your way
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.480]   through them again and again.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.480]   I actually think it's quite compatible.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:02.360]   It's quite compatible with a systematic response to these all too common types of
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.440]   mental mental health issues.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.000]   So keep with it. Take your time, but keep with it.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.440]   I think you are going to find it beneficial in combination with professional help.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:16.920]   All right, so what I want to do next, that's a good good place to end it on the
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.000]   questions in the final segment today.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.920]   I want to do a cover reveal for my new book, Slow Productivity.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.040]   Before we get to that, though, I want to talk about another sponsor that makes this show
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.800]   possible. It's our friends at My Body Tutor.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.080]   I've known Adam Gilbert, My Body Tutor's founder for many years.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:40.760]   He used to be the fitness advice guy for the Study Hacks blog, and he's had this company
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.360]   for a long time. It has been very successful for the obvious reason that it makes a lot
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.240]   of sense. My Body Tutor is a 100 percent online coaching program that solves the biggest
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.160]   problem in health and fitness, which is lack of consistency.

[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.080]   What are you trying to do with with your food and that type of health?

[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.600]   This type of eating. Avoid this.

[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.240]   So you get all of the consistency benefits that a Hollywood star would get when they

[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.840]   The title is Slow Productivity.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.440]   The subtitle is The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.880]   It comes out in March.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.240]   I wanted to talk about the cover.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.360]   I put this in my email newsletter, but we haven't talked about it yet on the show.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.440]   So I'm going to load up on the screen for those who are watching.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.800]   And again, if you're listening, go to the deep life dot com slash listen.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.600]   This is episode 263.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.680]   Be a link to the video below.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.280]   All right. So I've loaded on the screen here.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.840]   The cover. Of my new book.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.440]   So what you'll see if you're listening is this is not like the covers of my past
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:31.840]   books, you think about deep work, if you think about a world without email,
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.200]   that the two other books I've written about the world of work, it's big fonts
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.080]   on a sort of solid color background.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.160]   Those are books aimed at the world of business.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:46.320]   Like we're going to look at ways that technology has broken the world of
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.600]   business and what you should, how you should rethink business to get around
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:57.160]   these shortcomings, this book, what we see is a mountain range and a wooded, a
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:02.480]   pine forest with a path going through it, leading this way up to a cliff side
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.280]   cabin, overlooking a scenic mountain range.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.440]   So a very different look.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.360]   Have I showed you this yet, Jesse?
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.040]   Have you seen this one?
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:10.720]   Yeah, I saw it.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.840]   Cause you mentioned it and then I went and checked it out.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.920]   So what's going on here?
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:20.040]   Why, why, why this is a, um, it's a more aspirational, a more human cover.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.520]   I thought I'd talk a little bit about it.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.200]   Um, I see this book, slow productivity.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:30.280]   As being a part of a more general movement in the book world right
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.520]   now to reimagine productivity.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:38.240]   Reimagine productivity and move it towards what I call humanistic productivity.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:43.160]   So there's a genre of, of, uh, thinking and books that have emerged on
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.440]   what I call humanistic productivity.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.720]   Now, what does humanistic productivity mean?
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.000]   Well, first of all, it says, what do we, what's the definition, the
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.360]   general definition of productivity?
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.520]   It's the general arrangement of effort, the general arrangement of your
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.240]   efforts with some intention in mind.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.320]   So productivity is most general senses.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.800]   I do stuff all day.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.600]   Let me have some way of organizing these efforts towards
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.400]   some sort of intentional goal.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:12.880]   Now humanistic productivity believes, uh, if you don't do any such thinking,
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.800]   you don't end up someplace good.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:16.960]   You don't end up relaxed.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.560]   You're going to be, uh, you're going to be prone to two major
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.560]   sources of negative wellbeing.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:28.080]   The first is in the professional, in the professional sphere, reactive busyness.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.080]   So if you say, I just, Hey man, I don't do productivity.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.720]   You are going to get, uh, swallowed into a whirlpool of reactive busyness.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:36.240]   Oh my God.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.760]   Everyone is emailing me all the time.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.960]   And the faster I answer, the more they come out and there's all these zoom
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.480]   meetings and my God, everything is crazy.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.240]   You're not relaxed.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.480]   You get supercharged busyness.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.440]   And in your life outside of work, again, if you're like, I just, man, I just chill.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.360]   You're very prone to get swallowed in a whirlpool of supercharged distraction.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:00.080]   And next thing you know, uh, you know, you're up to 3:00 AM yelling at white
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.720]   supremacist on Twitter while building your underground bunker because of
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.360]   catastrophe seven through 11, that's going to hit and destroy
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.480]   the earth the next three weeks.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:12.200]   So just saying, I don't think about this stuff, man, is going to make you
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.720]   vulnerable to so many negative things.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.600]   So you need some sort of notion of productivity.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.320]   Here's how I arrange my efforts with some intention in mind.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.800]   But what humanistic productivity recognizes is that we can't leave this
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.680]   decision to the 2005 version of Merlin man, right?
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.920]   We can't leave this decision to the people online who spend all day trying
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.640]   to build their hyper optimized system so that you can have algorithmic support
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:42.080]   for generating your, you know, task list, optimization, synced Zettelkasten,
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.360]   whatever complexity, because that's just exhausting and it's
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.200]   turning humans into widget grinders.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.480]   So the sweet spot in productivity thinking is saying, how do I
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.480]   intentionally organize my efforts in a way that the entire goal is to support
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.640]   my humanity, to support a richer, fuller human life.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.640]   That's humanistic productivity, grounding productivity thinking in
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:09.240]   the pursuit of a richer, sustainable, fuller human life.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.720]   So there's a lot of books in this genre.
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.680]   I think we could go back.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.760]   I'll list a couple that I think all belong to this
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.120]   humanistic productivity genre.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.560]   I think Tim Ferriss's, the four hour work week is an early
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.160]   example of this genre, perhaps.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.960]   He was coming in and said, let's completely rethink work.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.120]   Let's completely rethink work as this huge means to an end, the end being all
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.920]   these other things that make a good life good.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.760]   And if we can be very clever about how you set up your work and how you automate
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.360]   it, let's just reduce the footprint and just make it this, this money engine
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.640]   that produces just enough proverbial horsepower that you can study.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.480]   Tango in Buenos Aires.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.960]   I think Gregory McEwen's essentialism is another book in this category.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.640]   It's about how do you sort of intentionally and aggressively
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.880]   take stuff off your plate.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.800]   So it understands that at the core of any humanistic productivity
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.600]   philosophy is avoiding overload.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:05.680]   You have Jenny O'Dell's how to do nothing and Celeste Handley's do nothing.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.200]   I think both those books are also really in this space.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.000]   They're there.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.320]   You know, Jenny is embracing a notion of productivity in which you
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.240]   are moving away from activity.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:21.880]   That you are purposely resisting a push towards activity as a way of
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:27.280]   reconnecting with values that aren't based off of action do nothing.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.760]   I think is a little bit more Celeste books, a little bit more approachable,
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:34.600]   a little bit less academic, but again, about reorienting a productive life
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.560]   away from quantity of activity, quantity of accomplishments.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.920]   I think Oliver Berkman's book 4,000 weeks is another great example of the genre.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.360]   It's a definition of productivity.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.160]   That's based on being completely fine with the fact that you can't do most things.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   So why squeeze in, you know, a few more things, most things you can't do anyway.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.000]   So what's the point of overloading yourself?
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.160]   You're still not doing most things.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.560]   So why not just accept that and be happy with the things you are doing
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.920]   and the opportunities you do have slow productivity.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.000]   My new book is sort of in that same genre.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.760]   So sort of a more humanistic approach to productivity.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.800]   So it's slow productivity.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.720]   I don't want to get into details.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.200]   Now we've got plenty of time for that as we get closer to the book.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:18.720]   And also I talk about it all the time on the show, but the cover looks like the
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:24.560]   way it looks, because this is a book about refinding your humanity in a world
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.280]   where the definitions of productivity that dominate in the world of work in
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:36.280]   particular are based on this inhuman unstoppered busyness, this more is better
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:40.280]   than less, it's up to you to decide how much work you do, but more is better than
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.800]   less, you go make these decisions every day.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:47.200]   And it's this exhausted self-recriminating sort of terrible way to organize work.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.440]   This is a more humanistic alternative.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:53.000]   That's why I say the lost art of accomplishment without burnout.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.880]   How do we do things we're proud of without having to be completely
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.400]   burnt out and overloaded?
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.640]   So anyways, to indicate this is not just a business book.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:09.280]   Here's what's another way that tech is corrupting the world of work and how to
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.920]   sidestep that to avoid the negative impacts.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.080]   It's also a book about refining your humanity and it's within that tradition.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:19.240]   And so I think this cover, I think captures more of that feel.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.400]   That's what I'm trying to capture here.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.560]   Not to say there's no technology in this book.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:26.800]   Look, I'm a CS professor at a famously liberal arts humanistic university.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.160]   So most of my work, one way or the other is about ways tech is having these
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.000]   impacts and how we refine our humanity.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.040]   And yes, at the core of this book, there's the story early on is the way that
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:40.360]   technology subverted these creaky definitions of productivity we had in
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.520]   office work and technology blew them up.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.840]   And that's why everyone's burning out.
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.680]   So there's technologies at the core of the problem here, but
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.840]   the solution is very human.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:51.040]   And it's a book about refining what matters to you in your life.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.960]   And so I think that cover, you know, captures that more so than just slow
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.080]   productivity, huge text on a clean background.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:00.800]   So there you go.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.880]   I'm excited about this one.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.520]   You'll obviously hear more about it in the spring as we get closer,
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:09.040]   but the cover's out there now it's on Amazon is pre-orderable.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.680]   So I figured we would have a quick discussion.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:16.040]   Jesse, my, what I was deciding on with this book cover was either this cover,
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.360]   which is, you know, the scenic view and the nice fonts.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:26.720]   The other cover I had in mind was I want to wear a kind of like a fun vest, you
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:31.520]   know, like a 1980s standup comedian, like a Paula Poundstone vest, and it would be
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.400]   me on the cover.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.760]   So my arms crossed like leaning back and kind of giving a, giving a coy look,
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:42.280]   giving a coy look at the, at the camera, or maybe like a saying, like just holding
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:46.200]   my chin, just looking at the camera, maybe like a quirky hat.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.920]   That's the other thing I was thinking like a bowler hat.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.360]   The, the pipe from your French accent guy.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.240]   I have a pipe.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:16:00.320]   I was definitely thinking like loud vest, fun hat, pipe in a sort of silly or like,
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.840]   you know, maybe I have my arms on my hips and sort of cocky my hips a little bit.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.960]   Like, so those are the choices.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.400]   So I thought it was that, uh, the third choice was me in a turtle costume, just
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.240]   slow, you know, so I was like, let's be on the nose here.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:19.480]   So it was going to be me in a turtle costume on all fours, um, holding a day
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:19.920]   planner.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.560]   So that was like the more of the on the nose option.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:26.640]   So it was me in a turtle outfit, holding a day planner, option three, option two,
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.360]   me in a loud vest and a funny hat and a pipe in a sort of a quirky position.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:34.640]   And then option one, which we went with in the end was this sort of, um, ascending
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:40.520]   um, aspirational humanistic, natural, uh, natural, softer color cover.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.240]   So, you know, it's a hard choice, but hopefully we made the right one.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.280]   Yeah, hopefully.
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.080]   All right.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.680]   Well, enough of that, enough of that nonsense.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.760]   Um, thanks for listening.

[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.640]   So we do appreciate that.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.680]   I'll back next week in the studio, me and Jesse.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.280]   Yay.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.520]   Enough of this remote stuff.
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.120]   We'll be back in the studio yet again, next week for another episode of the
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:13.240]   podcast and until then, as always stay deep.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:17.920]   So if you like today's discussion of reinventing your life with the deep life
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:24.720]   stack, then I recommend this episode, episode two 56, where I do a deep dive
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:30.560]   on why discipline is the first thing we look at when doing such a reinvention.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.720]   Why does cultivating the deep life start with discipline?
