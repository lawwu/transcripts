[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the Gospel according to Saint John in the fourth chapter.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Reading verses 13 and 14, Jesus answered and said unto her,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst;
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life."
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Let me read to you also from verse 19 to verse 25.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   "The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   But the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   For the Father seeketh such to worship him; God is spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah's cometh which is called Christ; when he is come he will tell us all things.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee, am he."
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Now we are considering, as most of you will remember and realize, the 13th and 14th verses,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   because there we have our Lord stating plainly and clearly what is, after all, the great offer of the Christian faith.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   We have a perfect description there of what Christianity really is and what to be a Christian means.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The Christian is one who has received this well of water springing up into everlasting life.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   He is one who has, we have read in the 16th verse of the first chapter, has received of his fullness and grace upon grace.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Now we are studying this from this standpoint.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   What do we know individually about this?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   This is essential Christianity. This is what we are meant to be like.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   The hymns we have been singing this morning, the words we have been reading from the scriptures,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   have reminded us that we are to be a rejoicing people.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   When our Lord first came into this world, you remember, his coming was accompanied by a heavenly choir singing, praising.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And that is the great note of the New Testament.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It must inevitably be the great note of the New Testament in the light of what we are told here that we are offered and what we can receive.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So the great question is, do we rejoice like this?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Do we rejoice in Christ Jesus?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You remember the apostles' description of the Christian?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   We are the circumcision.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Don't go back to Judaism, he tells those Philippians.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   We are the circumcision.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Well, who are we?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Well, we worship God in the spirit.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   But the question is, do we rejoice in Christ Jesus?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Now that is what we are considering together.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And we have seen in our study of this extraordinary case of the woman of Samaria,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   how so many of the things at which she stumbled are the very things at which we stumble.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   That is where this case is so instructive.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   We tend to fall into the same pitfalls.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   We become guilty of the same errors of understanding and apprehension.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And we have been working our way through this.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Now having considered the difficulties,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   we came last Sunday morning to the positive approach to all this.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And I put this question,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   what is it that is absolutely essential to the receiving of this great blessing,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   which will fill us with a joy unspeakable and full of glory?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And the answer is, it is an understanding of,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and a realization of, the truth as it is in Christ Jesus.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It is utter submission to him.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   He dealt with this woman in such a way that he brought her to that point.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And it is the point to which we have all got to come.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   This is ultimately the cause of trouble.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Uncertainty about him, failure to realize as we should who he is,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   why he came, what he has to give to us.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Now this is particularly true at the present time.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And it is of course quite fatal to any realization of the Christian experience as it should be experienced.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Any uncertainty about this blessed person makes it quite impossible to experience this great salvation.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So we are looking at him as he was pleased to display himself,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   to manifest himself to this woman of Samaria.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And we are using her stumbling efforts to understand who he was,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   because they so truly represent the position of many of us at this present time.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Now this is of course, in other words, if you like so to put it, the great message of Advent.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Why should Christian people be filled with a thrill, a sense of joy and rejoicing,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   as they contemplate at this season of the year, what happened when the Son of God was born as the babe of Bethlehem.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Why should that hymn, great hymn of Philip Doddridge, which we have just been singing,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   make us all feel that we want to remain standing on our feet,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   rejoicing and proclaiming this glad good news.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Well now, these are the questions that are before us and we are given great instruction here concerning them.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   You remember for me to summarize what we dealt with last Sunday morning.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   There are certain general characteristics of this message,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   and we've got to be clear about the general characteristics before we can come to the particulars.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   The great points we saw were this, the absolute exclusiveness of this message,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   its utter exclusiveness. There must be no compromise about this.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   This is the only way of salvation.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   There is no salvation in anyone, anywhere, except in Jesus, the Son of God.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   An utter exclusiveness. And it is so, of course, because it is of God, it's God's action.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Furthermore, it is because it is historical.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You're not saved by a teaching, you're saved by a person and what has happened in and through him.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   It's an historical event. Here is one standing before the woman of Samaria,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   "I that speak unto thee am he." This is history.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   He belongs to history. And it's once and for all, he divides time as we've seen.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   The hour is coming and now is. It's arrived, this hour.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   The whole of the Old Testament points to it, it's arrived. Since then we look back upon it.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Here it is. Well now, these things establish its utter uniqueness and exclusiveness.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   This faith of ours is an intolerant faith. And it must be intolerant.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Anything that derogates from the wonder and the amazement of that which happened
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   when the Son of God came into this world and what he did, anything that derogates from that
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   is to be denounced in the strongest terms. That is why the Apostle says that
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel than that which we have preached unto you.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Let him be accursed. And we must all learn to say that.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And to realize that the supposed tolerance of this present age in which we live
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   is nothing but sentimental flabbiness.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   An insult to what God has done once and forever in the Son of his love.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Very well. Now there we've seen these things in general, but that isn't all.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   We must go on. I ask therefore in the light of all this,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   why are people so blind to him and to these things?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Why are people so slow to realize the truth of this message of Advent as they should?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Why are we all ourselves so little moved by it?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Why is it that we don't rejoice in it as we should and as the first Christians so clearly did
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   and as Christian people have always done in every great period of reformation and our revival?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Well I think that another of the answers to this question is this.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   That it is a failure to realize our true need.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Or if you prefer it another way around, it is our failure to realize
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   what is to be found in him and what is possible to us and for us in him.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Now that's the thing I want to deal with this morning.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   It is only the people who have realized their need who truly rejoice in him.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Therefore, if there is a lack of rejoicing in him, it is probably due to the failure
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   to realize your condition, your position, your real need.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Now let's see how this story of our Lord's handling of the woman of Samaria
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   helps us to realize this aspect of the truth.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   This is to be seen in certain words which he used and in certain words which she used.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Our Lord, you notice, says to this woman of Samaria, "Salvation is of the Jews."
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   That's the word, salvation.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   We were emphasizing mainly last Sunday that it was of the Jews.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   We now emphasize salvation.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And indeed, the better, the strictly accurate translation here should be this.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   We know what we worship for the salvation.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   The salvation.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It is the salvation.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Which as I'm going to show you means that it is the salvation that has been talked about.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   That the Jews were waiting for.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   The salvation is of the Jews.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Well, that's the term that our Lord uses.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Then look at these terms that are used by the woman.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   The woman says unto him, "Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet."
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   A prophet.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Then she goes on and says, "I know that Messiah's coming."
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Which is called Christ. When he has come, he will tell us all things.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Prophet. Messiah's. All things.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Now what do these terms mean?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   What does she mean by these terms? What's their connotation?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   What does our Lord mean when he talks about salvation?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Now this is of the very essence of this matter.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Well, now all these terms obviously refer to the Old Testament and its teaching.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   That's where they come from.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And you can only understand them as you know your Old Testament.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   That is a part of the meaning of this phrase of our Lord's, "Salvation is of the Jews."
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   He says the salvation comes out of, out of the Jews.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And there he's not only referring to the fact that he himself actually did come of the Jews according to the flesh.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   He is referring also to the fact that the whole teaching, the whole concept, the whole purpose of salvation
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   is something that God has provided and has worked out through the Jews.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   It comes out of the Jews, out of this particular nation.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Now, I'm not concerned to emphasize this morning the exclusiveness.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   We've done that, but do bear it in your mind.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   It is essential to understand this teaching.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   In other words, all these terms tell us that the Old Testament is the preparation for the New Testament.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And there is a sense in which we simply cannot understand the New Testament truly apart from the Old Testament.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And except we approach it in the light of the teaching of the Old Testament.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   That is where the Holy Spirit, you see, guided the Church in the early centuries to incorporate the Old Testament with the New.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   And that is why there is nothing more fatal than for Christian people to think they don't need the Old Testament.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   The two belong together, and each casts its light upon the other.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Now, the function of the Old Testament is to show us the need.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   It is the preparation for this salvation that he talks about.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   And of course, the whole function of the prophets was to teach about this.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And the Messiah, the whole term, suggests the one who is coming to provide this deliverance, this salvation, the satisfaction of that need that is in existence.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Now, the Old Testament shows us this plainly and clearly.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   It is its main function.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   It does so in many different ways.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   It does so in explicit statements, particular statements.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   It does so in its explicit teaching.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   You see, if you want to know the beginning of this Gospel, if you want to understand the connotation of this word "salvation,"
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   if you want to know the real meaning of this word "Messiah," you must go back to Genesis 3.15.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   There it is. There is the first statement, the first teaching concerning it.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Man has sinned. He has got himself into trouble.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   He is in a position of hopelessness and despair.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   There is going to be enmity between him and the seed of the serpent.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Life has become chaotic.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Is there no hope? Here is the answer.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Salvation is coming. It is going to come.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Now, there is the beginning of all this.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   This is the only way in which we can understand these terms.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Christ as the Savior. Why doesn't it move us?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Because we have never realized our need of salvation as we should.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   We have never realized the truth about ourselves.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   But it goes on in the Old Testament in promises, in covenants.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   God keeps on repeating this, what he is going to do.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   The whole story of Abram and the creation of this nation,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   and the repetition of the promises and the renewal of the covenant.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   It is all a part of this, and it all casts its great light upon this person who has come.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   And then of course you get it very definitely in the law.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   The law, with its underlining, pinpointing of sins and transgressions, disobedience.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   All that is designed to show us the need to prepare us for this great salvation which is to come.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And then you get it also, of course, enacted in the ceremonial and the ritual
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   in connection with the tabernacle and the temple.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   What's the meaning of all the details about the furnishing of these buildings?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   What's the whole point about burnt offerings and sacrifices and meal offerings and peace offerings?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Is this just some ancient history of no importance and of no interest to us?
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Is this just a part of the folklore of primitive people? No, no.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   This is God's ordinance, and these are all but types and shadows
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   pointing forward to something that is going to come.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   He taught, he prepared the way through these types and shadows,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   adumbrations of that which was to take place.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And then you get it, of course, in the great prophetic teaching.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   The great note to the prophets.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   We have a sample of it in the 35th chapter of Isaiah's prophecy.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   At the beginning it's one out of many.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God."
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   There's another. The Old Testament is full of this.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   "O everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters."
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   The same thing.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   It is all a part of this great preparation which you find in the Old Testament.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Now, the point I'm establishing is that no one ever appreciates the salvation
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   unless he understands his need.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   There's no point in a promise of deliverance if you're not aware that you're a captive.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   You remember the Jews constantly failed at that point.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   There's a wonderful illustration of it in the 8th chapter of this gospel according to St. John.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   "When our Lord said to some people one afternoon,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   'If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.'
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   And instead of standing up and praising God and thanking Him,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   they stood back on their dignity and they said,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   'We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man.'
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   How sayest thou, 'Ye shall be made free?'"
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   We don't need your talk about your freedom.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   What was the matter with them?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   They didn't realize their condition of serfdom and of slavery.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And my dear friends, if your heart is not moved and thrilled
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   by the whole conception of the coming of the Son of God into this world
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   and this great salvation, there's only one explanation.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   You don't know the truth about yourself.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   You've never seen your need.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   You've never learned the great lesson of the Old Testament.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Well, no. This is the background, you see, to these great statements.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   The salvation is of the Jew.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   The Messiah is when He cometh.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   He shall tell us all things.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   What does all this mean?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I say you can only understand it as you realize the need.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   So there are two things for us to consider.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   The first is the need itself.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   The second is the salvation which He came to bring.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Now, look at this need. What is it?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Well, it's men's condition.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Men is vaguely aware that he has a need.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   The most thoughtless person is aware that there's something wrong.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   The giddiest person in London last night must have known in his or her heart
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   that there's some lack somewhere.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   A woman of some area is aware of a need.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Living as she was in pleasure and in sin, she knew there was a need.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   She is interested in profits.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   She talks about Messiahs.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Ah, yes, but the fact that the world and its individuals are aware of a need is not enough.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   That's of no value, really.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   That can often lead to just trying to forget it in another round of pleasure.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Or it can lead to despair, cynicism, hopelessness.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   The important thing for us is to discover exactly what our need is.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And this is a part of the preaching of the Gospel.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   We must know our precise need, our exact need.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And it is only those who know that who will ever really rejoice in the Saviour and in His salvation.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Now, we therefore must note for a moment certain false ideas with regard to the meaning of this word "salvation".
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Our Lord puts it like this deliberately.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Salvation, He says, the salvation is of the Jew.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   The Samaritans had their idea of salvation, but it was hopelessly incomplete.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   They had nothing but the first five books, the first books of Moses.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   They didn't understand. They lacked the prophetic teaching. They lacked this further teaching.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   So their whole notion of salvation was incomplete.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Not only that, we know that the Jews themselves at the time of our Lord had an equally inadequate view of salvation
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   and of what the Messiah would do when He came.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   You know how they were so consumed by political and military notions and ideas.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   How they thought so much in terms of the greatness of the Jews of Israel
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   that they were blinded to the real meaning of the term "salvation".
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   They didn't realize their need.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   It was the whole tragedy of the Pharisees who were so self-satisfied, so pleased with themselves.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   And indeed, we see the disciples themselves stumbling and fumbling after this, even after the resurrection.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   We read in the first chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   they turned to our Lord and said, "Will thou at this time restore the kingdom unto Israel?"
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   That's the thing they were after. Political, military greatness.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Greatness in some human sense. This nation towering over all the other nations.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Now that's a complete misunderstanding of the meaning of salvation.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Hence, all that you read of in the pages of the four Gospels,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   of the misunderstanding of the Pharisees and Scribes and Sadducees and Doctors of the Law,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   the fact that you are interested in salvation is not enough.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   It must be exact. It must be precise.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   You must know the character of the salvation that you stand in need of.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Now, as this was the case, way back at the time of our Lords coming into this world,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   roughly two thousand years ago, it is equally true today, perhaps even more so.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Because there is grievous misunderstanding of the meaning of this word salvation.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   This, I suppose, has been the curse of the last hundred years.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   That men, whose duty it has been to teach and to preach the Bible and the message of the Gospel,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   have gone on using the terms but have evacuated them of their meaning.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   They still talk about the Saviour. They still talk about salvation.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   But they no longer mean by it what the New Testament means by it.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   What our Lord himself so plainly taught is meant by it.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   They use the terms. They change the meaning.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   So that the fact that a man says he believes Jesus is the Saviour,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   doesn't of necessity tell me anything at all.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   You've got to ask him what he means by that.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   What exactly does he understand by Saviour?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   That's where the dishonesty comes in.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   That they use the terms but have changed the meaning.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   So don't accept merely the fact that a man says, "I believe that Jesus is the Saviour."
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   What does he mean by that?
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Well, you'll find that very often today what he means is this.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   His idea of salvation is that we need help in order to save ourselves.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   That's the essence of the whole of the modern teaching, the modern outlook.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   That man can save himself but he does need some help. He needs assistance.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   He's not basically wrong.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   They no longer accept the whole notion of sin.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   There's no such thing as sin.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   There are inadequacies. There's a lack of development.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   But man is essentially right and he's got it within him to put himself right.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Man is to save himself.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   They say there's no magic. It's not done for you.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   You've got to do it yourself. So what does he need?
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Well, he needs ethical teaching.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   He needs instruction as to how he should live.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Ethical, moral teaching.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Not only that, they say that he needs especially to be taught about love.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   This is the great popular teaching of today.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   We need to be taught about love.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   If only we could all grasp and get Jesus' teaching about love.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   That's how they put it. Put it into practice.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   All would be well.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   So we must listen to his teaching and we must above all look at him.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   See it in him.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   See how he reacted to cruel people, spiteful people, malign people.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   See how he responded to persecution.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   There it is. Here he is. He's enacting this great principle of love.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   He's got it. He lived it.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And what we've got to do is to look at him, accept his teaching, put it into practice.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   He encourages us by his example and thereby he helps us to deliver ourselves.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   But we've got to rise up and do this.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Now that is the meaning that is attached to the word salvation at this present time.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Man's condition is not desperate.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   It's bad, but it's not desperate.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   He still can save himself.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And the purpose and the function of Jesus is to teach us, to tell us, and to help us
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   how to save ourselves in that way.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Well now, that I want to show you once more.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   And if we don't do this, there's no point in talking about Advent and Christmas.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   That is all wrong.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   That's a denial of the whole of the teaching of the preparation in the Old Testament.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   It is an utter contradiction of the teaching of our Lord himself and of all the apostles
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   as we find it in their writings in this book.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   What is the true view?
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Salvation is of the Jews.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Salvation is only understood in the light of this Jewish teaching,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   the Old Testament teaching, the background, the preparation.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   What is it?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Well, what he tells us about men is this.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   I'm only going to give you some headings this morning.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   I'm simply giving you a broad, big picture of the connotation of this word "salvation,"
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   this glorious word.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   What's the need?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Well, men, we are told, is spiritually dead.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   That's the first thing we are told about him.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   He's spiritually dead, which means this, that he's ignorant.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   He's ignorant of God.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   The fool hath said in his heart, "There is no God."
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Our Lord in his great high priestly prayer says,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   "Oh, Father, the world hath not known thee."
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   That's the trouble, the whole trouble of the world this morning.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   It doesn't know God.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And my dear friends, this is our trouble also, all of us.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   It is still our ignorance of God that explains that we are what we are,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   ignorance of God.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   It's one of the manifestations of spiritual death.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Man's not only ignorant of God, he's ignorant of the whole of the spiritual realm.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   And he is therefore ignorant of his own true nature.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   This is still the great trouble.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Man doesn't know the truth about himself.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Modern man, so boastful about his achievements, is insulting himself
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   and his own true nature.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   He doesn't realize the uniqueness of man, glories in the fact that he's evolved from an animal.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   He doesn't see this. This is because he is spiritually ignorant.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   He doesn't realize the true purpose of life, but still more serious.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   This is the thing I want to emphasize.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Man is not only ignorant, he is incapable of appreciating the truth when it's put before him.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Now this is the serious thing.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   He is blinded. Because he is spiritually dead, he lacks a spiritual faculty.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   So much so, that when he's confronted by the truth,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   he not only doesn't see it, he resents it, and he rejects it.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   He's as blind as that.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   See, this is the answer to this notion that man is essentially inherently good
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and can save himself if he's given a little help and aid and instruction.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   He cannot.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Now this is something which is laid down quite explicitly by our Lord himself.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   "How can ye believe," he said to the Jews, "how can ye believe which receive honor of one of another
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   and seek not that honor that cometh from God only?"
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   But listen to the Apostle Paul putting it more explicitly and plainly to the Corinthians.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   He talks about this wonderful preparation which God has made for our glory
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And then goes on to say, "Which none of the princes of this world knew.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   The Lord of glory stood before them, and they rejected him, they saw nothing in him.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Who is this fellow, this carpenter?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   They dismissed him, they denounced him, they called him a blasphemer."
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   That is blindness, spiritual blindness, spiritual death.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   "Though the truth incarnate is before them, they cannot see him."
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Well Paul goes on to put that quite explicitly.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   That's men's trouble.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   It's no use saying all people need is light and instruction.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   The light has come.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   "And men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Men are confronted by the light, they don't see it.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   They dismiss it, they joke about it, they laugh at it.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   They're not interested, they cannot.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   "The carnal mind is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God."
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Neither indeed can be.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   It is impossible.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Men is spiritually dead.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   He cannot appreciate the teaching.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   He cannot appreciate the light.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   "He loves darkness rather than light, because his deeds were evil."
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   He's spiritually dead.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Now you see, this is the preparation for the salvation.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It's the message of the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   That men, when he rebelled against God and sinned, died a spiritual death.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Secondly, he is under the wrath and the condemnation of God and his holy law.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   The whole of the Old Testament deals with this.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Why was the law ever given?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   The Jews in their blindness misunderstood and thought that the law was given
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   in order that they might save themselves through it.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   But what a misunderstanding of the law.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   The law was never given to the Jews in order that they might put it into practice
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   and thereby save themselves.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   They couldn't do it because of their condition.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   The answer is this, Romans 5.20.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   "Moreover, the law entered that the offence might abound."
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   That's the purpose of the law.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   "But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   But that's the object of the giving of the law,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   that the offence might abound, that it might be seen, brought out, displayed.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Romans 7.13, still more clearly, he says,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   "Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   But sin, that it might appear, sin, working death in me by that which is good,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   That's the object of the law,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   is to bring out the true nature and character of sin.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   That's why God gave the law to the children of Israel of old.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Or as Paul sums it up,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ."
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   How does it do it?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Here it is in Romans 3, verses 19 and following.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   "Now we know that what thingsoever the law saith,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   it saith to them that are under the law."
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   What for?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   "That every mouth might be stopped,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and all the world might become guilty before God."
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   That's the purpose of the law.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   But now the righteousness of God without the law,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   apart from the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   "Even the righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and upon all that believe, for there is no difference,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God."
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   That's it.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Now that's the whole,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   that's a summary of the teaching of the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   That man is not only dead spiritually, he's under condemnation,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   he's under the wrath of God.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Indeed Paul, you see, puts this so perfectly,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   the point I'm trying to make feebly this morning,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   he puts it like this in Romans 1, 16, 17, and 18.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   He says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   That's light it is.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   He means I'm tremendously proud of it.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   I'm thrilled by it, I burst in it, I want to tell everybody about it.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Why?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Well, because it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   for everyone that believe it,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   to the Jew first and also to the Greek,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   "For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   as it is written, 'The just shall live by faith.'
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   For, here's the reason why he glories in the great salvation."
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   This is why he exalts in it.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Why?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   "The wrath of God has been revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   and unrighteousness of men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   That's it.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   That's why this is so wonderful, this salvation.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   "The wrath of God from heaven has been revealed."
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   The whole of the Old Testament does that, the law does that.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Man is not only dead, he's under the wrath of God
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   and he's facing eternal punishment,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   a continuation in this state of spiritual death and torment
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   and unhappiness forever and forever.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Not only that, he is living a life which is in the flesh and after the flesh.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   He's under the dominion of sin and under the dominion of Satan.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   In the eighth chapter of this Gospel, according to Saint John,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   our Lord says to certain people, "You are of your father the devil."
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And all men and women who are not in Christ are in the devil, as it were,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   and are his children.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   We are in the kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of Satan.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   When Paul is called on the road to Damascus to preach,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   what is the commission our Lord gives him?
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   He says, "I'm going to send you to the people and to the Gentiles
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   to call them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God."
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Yes, says John in his first epistle, chapter 5,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   "The whole world lieth in the evil one."
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   And that is the position of the world that doesn't believe in Christ this morning.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Under the dominion of sin and Satan, slaves of evil and of the devil.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Not only that, with a nature that is polluted, an evil heart of unbelief,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   loving the darkness rather than the light.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Or, as I've often put it and reminded you of it,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   as you find it in Ephesians 4, 17 and following,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   "This I say then and testify in the Lord, that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk."
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   How? In the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   because of the blindness of their heart.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Who being past feeling, have given themselves over unto lasciviousness,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   to work all uncleanness with greediness.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   That's it, the pollution of sin.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   And finally, man is under the power of death.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And there it faces him, the last enemy, and all his lifetime he is subject to bondage
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   because of this fear of death.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   My friends, that is the teaching of the Jews,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   the teaching of the Old Testament, the revelation of God,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   given before the advent of the need of man.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   If you don't believe that, you'll see nothing in what I'm going to say about the great salvation.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   It is only those who realize that that is the truth about themselves
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   who ever rejoice in this great salvation.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Salvation is of the Jews.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Listen to him. What's he talking about? What is this salvation?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Well, here, let me give you some further headings to go home to think about.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   And if it doesn't make you sing and rejoice,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   all I've said so far has meant nothing to you.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   You've never been convicted of sin.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   You just want to be religious, you just want a little bit of help.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   That's not it. Conviction of sin is essential.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   The law must do its work before any man will ever see the glory of this great salvation
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   because he's never seen his need of it.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   What does he tell us?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Well, he tells us that he alone can give it.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   He alone can provide it.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   That's why he has ever come into the world.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Salvation is out of the Jews.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   He is one of them. He comes out from them.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   God brought them into being in order that he might come.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   It is a salvation that is to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   It is a salvation that is to be preached first in Jerusalem, then in Samaria,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   then in the outermost parts of the earth.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   It is the only salvation.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   He came, I say, specifically to give this.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   He came to deliver us out of that predicament which has been outlined in the Old Testament.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   He says, "The Son of Man is come," what for?
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   To provide ethical moral teaching?
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   To give us an example of a life of love lived before us?
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Of course it's all that, but that damns me.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   More than anything else, I can't face the Ten Commandments,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   leave alone the life of Christ.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   That throttles me into utter hopelessness.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   No, no. The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   This is the object, this great and glorious salvation.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   He says that he's come to do that.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   But thirdly, he gives it fully.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   He gives it entirely.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   He gives it completely.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   It needs no supplement.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   It brooks no addition.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   You must never add anything to it, whether circumcision or marry the Mother of Christ,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   or the church or a priesthood.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   You mustn't add anything to this.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   You're derogating, I say again, from his glory.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   It is a perfect salvation.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   What is it?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Well, time fails me.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Read your Scriptures, my dear friends,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   and pray for the Holy Spirit to open your understanding before you read them.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   And then you'll see this glory being unfolded to you.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Let us listen to our Lord Himself putting it.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord."
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   And he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   And he began to say unto them, "This day is this Scripture fulfilled,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   filled to the full, in your ears."
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   There it is.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   It is a complete, it is a full, it is a perfect salvation.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   He is the fulfillment of all those glorious, thrilling, moving, triumphant prophecies
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   which are to be found in the Old Testament.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Not only that, here he is at the end of his life.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   He has finished his teaching.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   He is under the very shadow of the cross.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   What does he say?
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   These words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   "Father, the hour has come. Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   as thou hast given him power over all flesh,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   I have glorified thee on the earth.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do."
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   And on the cross, listen to him, it is finished.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Finished completely.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   When he had by himself purged our sins, he sat down on the right hand of God.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   It is finished.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   He has done everything that he came to do.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And this is what he means by this word salvation.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   The fullness of it, the sufficiency of it.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   The apostle Paul, of course, is constantly trying to give expression to this.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   He says, "You are complete in him."
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Don't go back to philosophies or to these vague angelic teachings, these hierarchies.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   You are complete in him.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   All the fullness of the Godhead dwelleth bodily in him, and you are complete in him.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Listen to him bursting out at the very beginning of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   "As in a time he so moved, he so thrilled.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in him, the places in Christ."
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   That is the meaning of the word salvation.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Nothing less than that.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Peter is not to be outdone.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   He has got his own way of putting it.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   It is not as eloquent and as moving as that of Paul.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   But listen to him, he puts it like this.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   "Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   to them that have obtained like precious faith with us
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   according as his divine power hath given unto us all things."
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   The very term used by the woman of Samaria.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   "All things that pertain unto life and godliness
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue."
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And he goes on to talk about the exceeding great and precious promises.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Oh, this is the meaning of the word salvation.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Ephesians 3, 8 again, "The unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   The breadth and length and depth and height,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   that he might be filled with all the fullness of God."
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   What is this?
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   "Well, it is the salvation that is in him himself.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   But of him are ye in Christ Jesus,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   He is the all and in all."
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   What does he mean?
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Well, he talks about wisdom.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   This means light, this means teaching.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   You remember how John puts it in the 18th verse of this great gospel of John in the first chapter?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   "No man hath seen God at any time,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   the only begotten which is in the bosom of the Father.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   He hath declared him, he has led him forth,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   he has taught, he has instructed, he has manifested."
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Light, wisdom, wisdom from God.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   It pleased God through the foolishness of preaching to make these things known,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   giving us understanding.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Oh, that hymn that we sang just now expresses it all so perfectly,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   doesn't it, that great hymn of Philip Duttridge?
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Listen to it again.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   "He comes from thickest films of vice,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   to clear the mental ray,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   and on the eyeballs of the blind,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   to pour celestial day."
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Have you got this light?
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   This is a part of this great fullness,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   wisdom from God.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Then righteousness.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   There is none righteous.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   "No, not one," says the Old Testament.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   We are all condemned, we are guilty before God.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   We can do nothing about it.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   You can't erase your past, you can never live properly in the future.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   What can you do?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   There's only one hope for you,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   it is this salvation that he has come to give,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   forgiveness of sins,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   clothed with the robe of his spotless, perfect righteousness,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   reconciled to God.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   What else do you need?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Well, I said that we are all under the power of sin and of Satan.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   We all have a polluted nature.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   Wisdom, righteousness, sanctification.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   I need to be delivered from the power of sin,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   from the pollution of sin within my life and nature.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Can he do it?
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Yes, he can.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   It's a part of this salvation that he talks about.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Salvation is of the Jew,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   salvation is in me, I am he.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   What is it?
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   A new birth, a new nature, a new life, a new beginning,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   sonship of God, adoption into the family of heaven,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   a progressive work of the Holy Spirit within me,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   getting rid of sin, undoing the works of the devil
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   and increasingly preparing me for the glory that awaits me.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Oh, let Philip Duttridge put it again for us,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   "He comes, the prisoners to release, in Satan's bondage held,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   the gates of brass before him yield, the iron fetters yield."
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   He is the one who can cleanse us in this way
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   and to set us free with the liberty wherewith Christ
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   hath made us free.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   Wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   and at the end of it all, redemption.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Final glorification, deliverance from death,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   the last enemy he has destroyed, he's done it all.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   And he opens the gate of paradise and of heaven,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   my very body shall be changed when I see him.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   He has such power that he can change the body of my humiliation
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   and fashion it like into the body of his glorification.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   Final, complete deliverance from sin in every shape and form.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   It is thine to cleanse the heart, to sanctify the soul,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   to pour fresh life in every part and new,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   create the whole, everything, perfect.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   So what can we do as we contemplate this great salvation of his?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   What can we do better, I say, than remember the words of Jude?
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   "Now unto him that is able to keep us from falling while we are left in this world,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   and to present us faultless before the presence of his glory
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   with exceeding joy, to the only wise God, our Saviour,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever."
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Amen.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Are you ready to ascribe that to him?
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Have you seen your need?
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Have you seen the fullness of the salvation that he came to supply and to provide?
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   Beloved people, give yourselves no rest until you really are filled with a desire to praise him,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   until you rejoice in him with a joy that is unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   Let us ask him to do this work in us by singing our last hymn, which is hymn number 179.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   179.
