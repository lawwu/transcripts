[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   he made me think that everything was going to be reversed and okay, and anybody that
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.680]   money was borrowed from, they would get it back, maybe tenfold. And so it was this
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.840]   weird situation of having one foot in his reality and potentially believing the things he was saying
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:26.400]   or even over time wanting to believe them more and more because the alternative was worse.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.120]   The alternative was increasingly a bigger and bigger nightmare.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:39.120]   The following is a conversation with Sarma Melengalas, a chef and restaurateur who was
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.160]   the subject of the Netflix documentary Bad Vegan, Fame, Fraud, and Fugitives, that documents the
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.400]   rise and fall of her vegan raw food restaurants in New York City that ended in what she called
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.240]   a road trip from hell, being arrested in Tennessee, her pleading guilty for stealing over two million
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.680]   dollars, and serving four months at Rikers Island Jail. Sarma disputes the veracity of the
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.120]   documentary and its conclusions, saying that she was misrepresented. So I wanted to talk to her to
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.280]   get the full story and to seek understanding of who she is as a human being, the good and the bad.

[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.280]   And now, dear friends, here's Sarma Melengalas. You said that you did a lot of reading when you
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.400]   were growing up, and you mentioned Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.520]   So from the reading you've done in those early days, how did you see the world? Was it to you
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.240]   a beautiful place or a cruel place? I don't think I thought about the world. You were focused on
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.080]   family, just basic day-to-day life? I think I was focused on day-to-day. I had an awareness of not
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.960]   fitting in, but I think back then it felt like something was wrong versus some people are just
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.240]   that way. And speaking of books, I read a book called Party of One by a woman named Anneli
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.560]   Rufus that somebody gave me and suggested I read, and that helped a lot. That was one book that made
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.480]   me feel like it made me understand things from the past that I hadn't understood before, specifically
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.400]   kind of feeling out of place, even among my family, which is where you're not supposed to
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.800]   feel out of place. Yeah, I'm not sure where I saw it, but I think you mentioned that you were
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:44.320]   a bit of a loner, and I also think I saw somewhere pictures of you with green hair in high school
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.160]   and a wild haircut. What was that about? Was that real? Am I just imagining? No, you're not
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.240]   imagining it. It's strange because I was kind of a loner, so it'd be strange to do something that
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.880]   calls so much attention to yourself because back then, I mean, I grew up in a suburb of Boston
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.680]   in Newton, and anybody that was there around that time, probably if you said that girl with green
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.920]   hair or blue hair, it was blue most of the time, they would remember seeing me walking down the
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.080]   street because it stood out like crazy, especially back then. Now, it wouldn't stand out so much,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:28.000]   but back then, it really stood out. So I was trying to think about why I did that when
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.840]   I was kind of shy and on the one hand, wouldn't want to bring attention to myself,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.760]   but I did something that did. And it wasn't my family, to their credit,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.560]   they were fine with it, so it wasn't a rebellion against them or anything like that. They were fine
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.480]   with it. I don't think they loved it, but... Your dad was a physicist at MIT.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.240]   Yes. So he was cool with your green hair
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.480]   when you're a rebellion. That's just the way of life.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.040]   He was fine with the green hair, but I think in some ways, maybe they had to be fine with it
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:13.840]   because I didn't cause problems otherwise. And I got good grades in school. I was a very low
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.440]   maintenance child, I think. Even with the green hair. So Hunter S. Thompson wrote a lot of good
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.600]   stuff. He has a lot of just brilliant quotes, a lot of brilliant lines. So one of the ones I love
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.280]   is "Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.600]   well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.120]   totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, 'Wow, what a ride.'" What do you think about that?
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.080]   Is that good life advice from Hunter S. Thompson? I think so.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:02.400]   I think he followed it, right? Somewhere, I heard recently what he consumed in a day,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.640]   and it was kind of astonishing. It's funny, when I was in college, there were always really
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.280]   interesting people coming through, speakers and whatnot. And I tended to not go to events and
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.840]   whatnot. But in the four years I was there, I mean, really interesting people came through
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   and gave talks. I don't know, just a lot of famous people. But then one day, Hunter S. Thompson came
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.040]   to speak, and that was the only one I attended. Oh, wow.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.600]   That was the only interesting person who came to speak on the campus that I attended,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.640]   was Hunter S. Thompson. And he had a glass of whatever it was, whiskey.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.600]   And I don't remember a whole lot about it, but it was entertaining.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.720]   And yeah, I mean, later in his life, he started making less and less sense,
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.240]   but he was still somehow embodying the crazy that he represented throughout his life,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.320]   the boldness, the fearlessness, the wildness, all that kind of stuff. And we'll talk about Johnny
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.320]   Depp a little bit too. Funny enough, there's like an echo. Obviously, Johnny Depp played him,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.000]   or he starred in Fear, Loathing, and they hung out together. And it just seemed to somehow,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.640]   like the universe rhymes in these two individuals. They're both madmen in different kind of ways.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:23.040]   So you also told me that Leon, the Professional is one of your favorite films. It's also the
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.520]   reason you named your dog Leon. So what do you find beautiful and powerful about this film?
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.480]   I've watched it a bunch of times, but it's been a while since I've watched it.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:39.360]   So for people who haven't watched it, there's a guy named Leon played by Jean Renaud. There's a
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:50.080]   young girl, I think, I don't know, 13, 14. Matilda played by Natalie Portman. And she's abused.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:58.400]   She has a really hard life. Her parents are, spoiler alert, murdered. And then she finds
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:09.040]   protection under this fella, Leon, who also happens to be a professional assassin.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.920]   And he is also kind of a Forrest Gump type character. He's a really simple,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:23.520]   simple human. He seems to be like the immature one, or rather, the one who's young. And she
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.280]   seems to have a wisdom far beyond her age, because of the hard life she had to live through. And
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:37.760]   then they're here huddling together from the cruelty of the world and finding connection.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.480]   Yeah, I think it's one of those films where there's so many interesting things about it. But
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.080]   I'm sure one of them is just the contradiction of him being
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.000]   a caring person and reluctant to get attached to her. He tries to, I think he knows he's very
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.960]   reluctant to get attached to her in the beginning. And so, you see all of his humanity, but yet he's
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.560]   also an assassin that kills people. So, that's interesting. And I think probably a psychoanalyst
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.640]   would have a field day with why I like that movie so much. And I haven't gone there myself. But
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.920]   there's something I think about she, even in the brief part that depicts her in the beginning,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:28.160]   it seems clear that she's sort of out of place in her family. And
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.720]   then, yeah, there's all kinds of interesting things about their relationship along the way.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.840]   What I like about that movie, and I had to think about it recently, because I've read stuff about
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.240]   it that bothered me. Or it bothered me the fact that I haven't really thought about it before.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.920]   For people who haven't watched the movie, so here's a young underage girl who kind of comes
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:09:00.720]   on to him. First of all, I think she actually just doesn't know what familial love is. So,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:08.560]   this is the only way she knows how to express love. That's one. And two is, you know, a lot of
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:14.000]   bad people in this world would take advantage of that. And the fact that
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.760]   she finally met a human being who doesn't, and is just there to protect her. That's a real sort of,
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:30.800]   I don't know, a powerful statement of what it means to be sort of like a father figure,
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:39.280]   I suppose, a protector. So that to me, I love the idea of being sort of the protector.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:48.880]   That there's something worthwhile in this world to protect amidst all the cruelty that's all around.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.720]   So that's a beautiful kind of, you're basically saving this young human's,
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:08.480]   or you're repairing this young human's path to love, to real love in life. Because
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.680]   that idea of love was destroyed for her. Just family, everything is, everything is
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:22.080]   sort of, everything around her is broken. And he's kind of repairing it by reestablishing what
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:28.720]   that kind of love can be. I don't know. - And the plant. They save the plant also.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:34.240]   - Well, there's also just the simplicity of the film, just from a cinematic perspective,
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.240]   is beautiful. The music, the way it looks, the minimalism. - Even the violence was beautiful.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:47.760]   - Yeah, the violence. It was over the top. And also the bad guy, the bad cop, played by
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.920]   Gary Oldman. - Yeah, he was amazing.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.000]   - Yeah, I think he was listening to Beethoven or something like that. And he'd taken some sort of
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.080]   pills and drugs of some kind. So there was a kind of, like it's part of the orchestra,
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.600]   like the violence was part of some kind of musical creation.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:15.680]   - Yeah, it's interesting because I turn away from violence or films usually that have violence,
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:22.480]   or TV or anything that has that sort of element to it, except in certain cases where-
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:30.880]   - Where the violence is beautiful? - Yeah, yeah. Or did you see the movie
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.200]   True Romance? - Yes.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   - That's my second favorite movie. - Okay, that's probably my favorite movie.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.080]   - Oh, well, interesting. That's my second favorite movie.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.440]   - That's a more simple kind of love, but also with the violence that is beautiful.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.480]   - Yeah. - I suppose you could say.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.080]   - Yeah. And my favorite scene is the one with Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.600]   - Oh, yeah. Where there's a shotgun involved. - Yeah.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.920]   - Yeah. And then- - It actually makes me cry every time I see it,
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.760]   for some reason. -
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:12.560]   So for people who haven't seen the film, I think he's actually, I think he's hitting her. Or
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.800]   like there's blood and violence and so on. - Oh, yeah.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.960]   - Because she's resisting being murdered. - Yeah, there's a lot of violence. And then
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:28.080]   he throws her into the glass, the shower thing, and she's all cut up and beat up.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.400]   - And she laughs. - Yeah, there's just so much passion in it.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.960]   She knows she's gonna, or in that moment, she knows or thinks she knows that she's gonna die
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.080]   anyway. - Yeah.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.440]   - 'Cause she knows he's gonna kill her. So she kind of gives it all she has.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:54.400]   - But she also just has guts. She's not afraid. - Yeah. Well, and also she loves Clarence.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.000]   - Yeah. The love comes through through that violence. Yeah.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.920]   - Yeah. - Just like Clarence,
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:06.880]   her fella in that film has the same kind of thing when he visits-
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.920]   - Well, it was Gary Oldman again. - It was Gary Oldman again. That's right.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.400]   - Yeah. - The pimp.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.000]   - Looking very different. - Drexel.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.520]   - Drexel, yeah. - Yeah. And he's also fearless in that
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:21.760]   interaction saying, "She's not mine." It's interesting. That movie, so romantic. And
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.600]   happy ending, spoiler alert, in a way. - That's what I like about it too,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.640]   'cause I feel like some movies should come with, I don't wanna watch a movie if it's gonna be
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:36.000]   devastating, usually, unless it's worthwhile in some other way, but I'm kind of sensitive and I
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:44.160]   don't want... I don't like movies that have a terrible ending. There's a book I read because
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.800]   it got so many good reviews, and the very last scene, the woman steps in front of a train and it
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:14:00.320]   was like... So I'm partial to movies with happy endings. - Leon ends with loss. Leon the movie.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.440]   - Right, but it's still inspiring. - Love persists in some kind of form.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.800]   - Yeah. - She persists.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.600]   - And the plant. And the plant. - Okay, sure, sure. True Romance does have
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.080]   one of the... I mean, it's probably unhealthy. - That ending scene is just amazing.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:25.680]   - "You're so cool." Where she... Is that one? Where she just kind of looks at Clarence and her son
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:33.120]   and child or whatever, and she's saying, "You're so cool. You're so cool." Yeah. That's love.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:41.520]   - I just... That movie has so much in it because it's funny and there's so many good actors in that
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:47.280]   film. - And Brad Pitt plays in that film a pivotal role of Pothead on couch.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:54.000]   - Yeah. They're all so good and funny. And Michael Rapaport. And even Val Kilmer. People
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.640]   don't realize he's in the movie because he doesn't look like himself.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.320]   - Wait, what did Val Kilmer look like? - Val Kilmer's in the very end.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.880]   You know when he's... There's like the Elvis sitting there talking to him in the end?
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.640]   - Yeah. - That's Val Kilmer.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:17.040]   Yeah, you don't notice it unless you somehow either are very perceptive or noticed it in the credits.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.640]   - Yeah. And Quentin Tarantino wrote the film, I think.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.720]   - Yes. - Which is interesting. Directed by Tony Scott.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.520]   And the music is beautiful too. - And Christopher Walken and
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.960]   Dennis Hopper. - Dennis Hopper. Dennis Hopper plays
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:42.480]   Clarence's dad. And they have this very racist sounding scene. But the big
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:51.200]   important aspect of that scene is it's a father willing to die to protect his son. I mean,
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.880]   it's so much beautiful violence in that film. - There is. There is. I love that film so much.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:02.400]   - And she's a prostitute or not really. Part time, short time.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.320]   - No, it was her first time. - First time.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.200]   - Yeah. - Okay. And he saved her. And...
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   - My third favorite film has no violence whatsoever. - What's your third favorite film?
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.320]   - "A Room with a View." - What is it?
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:27.760]   - I feel like you'd like it. It's, I forget the author. It's a book and I read the book much later.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:39.440]   But it's Helena Bonham Carter and Daniel Day-Lewis is in it and Julian Sands.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.280]   - Daniel Day-Lewis is a fascinating character. - He's amazing in this film because he plays,
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.640]   he's very funny. He sort of plays a, he's a comical character, which is unlike most of what
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:17:00.080]   he does, I think. I don't watch a ton of movies, so, but yeah, he plays, his role is funny.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:07.680]   - Well, that's a heck of a top three. You brought me some books, some bread and books.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.800]   - Yeah. - Some Russian bread,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.880]   Russian inspired bread. - Yeah. I mean, it's Latvian, but it's
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.480]   similar to-- - Close enough.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.160]   - Similar to what's made in Russia and it's made at a Russian bakery in Brooklyn.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.960]   - That's where your dad is from, right? - My dad is from Latvia, yeah.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.800]   - So you got me some books, "Beautiful Ruins." - Yeah, and if you never read them,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   who cares? That's totally fine. People give you books and then you feel like you just,
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.960]   you sort of feel like-- - I see this as, we'll talk about this.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.400]   This is part therapy session. I don't feel the need to satisfy people's happiness.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.160]   - That's a good thing. - Okay, so, but it could also be
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:52.320]   an opportunity to experience something I never otherwise would have. So "Beautiful Ruins."
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:59.120]   - It's a book that made me laugh and cry and it's just a happy story. And for some reason,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.440]   I don't know exactly why, but for some reason, when you asked me to come, it just, I thought,
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:11.520]   "Oh, I'm gonna bring a copy of that book." - You just felt, it came, a voice told you.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.120]   - Yeah. - So there's others,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.200]   "Darkness Visible." - These are more--
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.520]   - "A Memoir of Madness," "Compelling, Harrowing, a Vivid Portrait of a Debilitating Disorder." It
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.080]   offers the solace of shared experience, "The New York Times." - This is--
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.840]   - William Styron. - There's a little bit about this book that
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:39.280]   reminds me of the Karl Deisseroth book because he writes about his own condition in, I mean,
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.320]   he's an amazing writer, so he writes about it in this beautiful way. And oddly enough,
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.120]   in some ways, it's kind of delightful. So it's not at all a depressing book,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.360]   at least I didn't find it depressing at all, I don't think it is. But he writes about his own
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:01.920]   experience with depression in such a beautiful way. My own copy is full of underlines.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.640]   - I would love that copy too. - The one with my--
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:12.880]   - I would love to look into the underlines and the books with notes, those little secrets that
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.360]   people leave, traces. - That's part of why I like
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:20.800]   paper books is 'cause I underline, I tend to underline like crazy. The Karl Deisseroth book
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.920]   is full of underlines too. - Well, I do the same thing on Kindle,
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.880]   and then you can actually more effectively go back to the things you've underlined 'cause you
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:36.240]   highlight and so on. But in fact, when you underline on paper books, you sometimes never
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.760]   go back, which always makes me sad. - To the book?
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.080]   - To the things you've underlined. - In the paper books?
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.760]   - Yeah, in the paper books. - Oh, I do, I go back.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.440]   - You do? - Yeah, I go back a lot.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.480]   - Do you wonder what the heck you were thinking about when you wrote something?
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:54.000]   - No, well, sometimes I underline things that are, well, also what I do is I have a whole file
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.040]   in Evernote of transcribed quotes from books, ones that I wanna save. So I might underline a lot
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:07.200]   of things in a book and then maybe like a third of them, I wanna write them down somewhere. So I
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.560]   write those down and I think even the time it takes to transcribe it is somehow worthwhile.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.680]   It's like searing it in your brain. - And you're reliving the memory
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.760]   of having read it the first time. - Yeah, and then sometimes I'll pick up books.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.240]   And sometimes I just underline sentences that are, it's not the content of the sentence,
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.640]   it's more that it's just a beautifully written sentence or like a particularly apt metaphor or
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:39.440]   something that's really nice. And I like paper books too 'cause I bought "Beautiful Ruins." I
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.560]   would have never heard of it, I don't think, except one of my favorite things is to go to
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:52.480]   used bookstores. Actually, Goodwill sometimes has really good big book selections depending on
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:59.120]   the area where you go. Sometimes you find a lot of treasures there. And what ends up happening a lot
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:04.000]   is I end up buying books that I know sometimes also 'cause I lost all my belongings at one point.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.680]   So I'll very often buy books that I've already read just to have them. But then what always ends
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.560]   up happening is I'll find, there'll be a couple of books that I buy that I've never heard of the
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.840]   author. I don't really know anything about, I don't know anything about the book at all,
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.360]   but something drew me to it. And what I like about that is you're buying used books, so it
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:31.600]   costs a dollar or two. So if you made a mistake, no big deal, who cares? But every time I come back
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:39.200]   with a book haul, there's usually at least one gem that I end up loving and I'm so glad that I read
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.600]   it. And "Beautiful Ruins" was that book for me. And I was drawn to it because of the cover art.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.560]   I just loved the cover and the colors. And then I picked it up and read the back and bought it.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:56.160]   And I also feel bad sometimes buying used books when the author is still alive, 'cause I feel
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.320]   like if you write a book, you should get the royalties. So...
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.600]   But you get to live with that regret.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.960]   Well, also, I'll usually end up putting a picture of Leon, reading the book online,
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.560]   and then other people buy it and read it. And so I feel like I've made up for...
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.520]   There you go, you make up for it.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.040]   I've made up for depriving him of the royalties.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.080]   I used to live in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.160]   I know it well. I used to hang out at the pit in Harvard Square with my
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.560]   green and blue hair when I was way too young to be doing that by myself.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.640]   And there's a guy that I think has been there for a long time,
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:39.200]   sort of between Kendall and Central, that would just lay out used books and sell them.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.400]   And I always loved that guy, whoever he was.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:49.360]   He had a cool hat, he's an older gentleman, and you could just tell he's seen some things.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:54.320]   I don't know who he is. I always wanted to actually talk to him for a long time,
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.800]   but I was too afraid, maybe 'cause I wouldn't be able to handle what he had to tell me.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.440]   'Cause I almost wanted to maintain the innocence of just, "Okay, here's this guy."
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.640]   But he was so...
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.800]   Every time you would ask him a question about a book, first of all, he's read all of them.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.320]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.800]   Which means he's traveled quite a few places inside these worlds.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.200]   And then you would tell him... I would look at a book, right?
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.160]   And he would catch you being curious about it, and then he would walk up to you,
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.480]   and then he would start talking about the book.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.440]   And he would always forget that you were there.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.240]   He's almost like... He's not trying to sell you the books.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.360]   Part talking to himself?
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.960]   Almost like an ex-girlfriend he's visiting through this book or something.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.240]   Did you buy books from him?
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.680]   Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.800]   But the experience of just being there, 'cause he lays them out, and people actually
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.400]   that watch or listen to this probably would be able to tell me what his name is,
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.840]   'cause I'd love to find that guy again.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.800]   I'm sure he's still there.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.480]   Maybe you'll have him on the podcast.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.160]   I 100% will.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.560]   But it's almost terrifying.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.880]   I'm not sure I can handle...
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.280]   'Cause he's been through some things.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.640]   I'm not sure if he's homeless or just looks like it.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.020]   Yep.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:09.780]   That's sometimes a thing.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:15.780]   And some of my favorite people either are homeless or look like it.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.260]   Okay, what's the third one?
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:24.820]   The Confession of a Sociopath by M.E. Thomas, A Life Spent Hiding in Plain Sight.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:30.340]   It's a book I recommend a lot, 'cause I've read a lot about sociopathy,
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.140]   and I've read all the books by psychologists.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:40.740]   And this one's written by a woman who understands herself that she is a sociopath.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:45.860]   And so it's beautifully written, but I learned more from that book than from any other book.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.260]   And I think I thought about it a long time ago.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:53.940]   I think a lot of conversations, you've talked a lot about good and evil,
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:58.420]   and whether everybody's really good or some people are not good.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:06.340]   And I think sociopathy is something that I think the world needs to understand much better.
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.980]   And so that book helped me understand a lot.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:14.100]   And it's beautifully written, and she tackles all the really interesting moral questions, like,
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:22.180]   what if we were able to definitively diagnose people in some way?
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:28.100]   You could immediately identify who's a full-blown sociopath.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.140]   And then what as a society would you do with them?
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:38.740]   Because in most cases, they're just gonna cause destruction and pain and harm,
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:44.820]   and/or potentially rise to power and become president or something.
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.300]   So I just found that book fascinating.
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:55.460]   - And we'll return to this idea, 'cause it's fascinating.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.500]   We'll return to human psychology and human nature.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:05.540]   But let's go through the timeline of your life.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.580]   Let's take a stroll.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.900]   So you wrote that the documentary about you called
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:15.060]   "Bad Vegan Fame Fraud Fugitives" is not a documentary.
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.780]   You got some things right, some things wrong,
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.900]   and some were, quote, "disturbingly misleading."
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.500]   So let's go through and get things right today.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:30.340]   First, can I give you a whirlwind summary, the way I understand it?
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:30.340]   - Yes.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.860]   - And also for context of people.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:39.620]   So 2004, you, Matthew Kenney, and Jeffrey Chodorow
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.980]   opened Pure Foods and Wine in New York City.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.180]   Did I say their names correctly?
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.220]   - Pure Food and Wine.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.420]   - No, their names.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:46.920]   - Oh, theirs.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.340]   Well, yeah, Matthew Kenney and Jeffrey Chodorow, yeah.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.180]   So it's, and I'll ask about what it takes
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.260]   to launch and run a restaurant in New York City.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.340]   That's a fascinating story in itself.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.660]   So it's an upscale raw food restaurant.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.060]   All right, that's 2004.
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.500]   2007, you opened One Lucky Duck Juice and Takeaway.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   And second and third locations in 2009 and '14.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:18.340]   All of those things close in 2016,
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.140]   '15 and '16, okay.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:26.820]   All right, 2009, Jeffrey lends you $2.1 million
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.780]   to buy the business outright and Matthew is out.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.220]   - Matthew was out earlier than that.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.540]   And then time passed, time passed.
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.620]   And I had, what was complicated is I had started
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.140]   the One Lucky Duck brand on my own.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:45.940]   - At first it was a dot-com that was doing like delivery.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.020]   - It was a dot-com where people could order ingredients
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.380]   and things and all of the products that we made and packaged.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.060]   So we made a bunch of cookies and snacks
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.540]   and things that were, I think, different.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.500]   And if I may say so myself, better than other--
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.820]   - Strong words.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.100]   - Products out there.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.340]   - Talk about the cookies.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.380]   - But I feel like I can brag about our food and products
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:14.660]   because I wasn't, you know, a few recipes early on
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:19.460]   I came up with, but it was the people that worked with me
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.660]   that created really good recipes and products.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:27.460]   And I was just kind of there curating it all
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.860]   or helping to get it out there.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.820]   - What was your favorite thing that you've created?
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.260]   Maybe yourself eat.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.780]   That not you created, but this whole,
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.380]   all of these efforts have created in terms of meal.
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.580]   Like you said, cookies, what are we talking about?
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.540]   - Oh, that's a hard question.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.620]   - It's just, okay, not the favorite,
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.460]   but like something that pops into memory
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.420]   that brought you joy.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.940]   - The Malo Mar, everybody loved the Malo Mar.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.100]   So very often we made like raw vegan versions
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.300]   of things that people are familiar with.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.580]   So it was, I think it was pecans.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.540]   It was like a salty cookie made with nuts
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.660]   and then covered in chocolate.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.460]   And then there's a big blob of coconut cream.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.060]   - I love coconut.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.540]   - Which it didn't taste coconutty.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.780]   Our ice cream was made with a coconut also.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.340]   It's like the meat from coconuts, pureed.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.340]   And then there's some soaked cashews in there.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.900]   But anyway, it was a blob of vanilla flavored cream,
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.060]   kind of like a healthy natural version of fluff.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.980]   I don't know if you're familiar with fluff.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.380]   - Basically every single word you say,
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.460]   I'm not familiar with, you should see my diet.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.420]   I don't, it's like steak and vegetables.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.660]   - A fluff is like a thing that I remember it
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.220]   from my childhood, like peanut butter and fluff
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.460]   is a ridiculously delicious combination.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.580]   - Is it fluffy or is it not?
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.620]   - It's like a marshmallow.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.980]   It's basically like if you softened marshmallows
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.820]   and made it into a luxurious, amazing goo.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.620]   - Oh, so it's like a fancy marshmallow.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.580]   - And then put it in a jar.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.620]   - Okay.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.060]   - And then made it spreadable.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.060]   It's spreadable marshmallows kind of.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.020]   - Oh, I see.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.940]   - I think that's, yeah.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.860]   - Spreadable marshmallows, got it.
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.380]   - Yeah, so there's a big blob of that.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.420]   - I didn't know that existed.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:10.980]   That's a thing?
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.540]   - Fluff.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.180]   - Fluff.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:12.900]   - I know.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.620]   - Does everyone, do people know about this?
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.460]   - Oh yeah, everybody knows.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.420]   - Okay.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.700]   - People, I mean, I think so.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.900]   People know about fluff.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.300]   - See, I think I went, I took the road less traveled by.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.260]   You know, I went the peanut butter and Nutella road
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.100]   in terms of spreadable things.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.660]   - Nutella is like the chocolate version
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.620]   and then fluff is like the vanilla equivalent sort of.
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.100]   - Okay, cool.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.900]   - But I think commercial fluff that you buy in the store
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.700]   is just like sugar and whatever else they put in there.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.140]   - So it's not actually fluffy.
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.820]   - It's kind of fluffy, but it's wet.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.220]   - Because Nutella is not fluffy.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.620]   - Yeah, so it's like Nutella if you whipped it
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:02.100]   and then kind of got a little bit aerated.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:02.340]   - Okay, so we're getting this.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.260]   - So it's a bit more fluffy.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.900]   - So fluff was a part of the formula here.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.620]   So it was fluff.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.580]   So the coconut cream that we made
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:15.540]   was like a healthy version of fluff, kind of.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.260]   - Nice.
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.780]   - Except it would, you know, you could make a quenelle,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:24.020]   like a little scoop of it and it would stay in that form.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.340]   Malamars were refrigerated
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.860]   and then there was like chocolate drizzled over that.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.140]   So it had that like salty, sweet thing going on.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.140]   That was probably my favorite.
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.740]   - And that's a dessert.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:40.340]   - Yeah, it was like a dessert snack.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.660]   It wasn't as, you wouldn't order it on the restaurant menu,
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.660]   but in the takeaway you could get them.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:50.100]   Or sometimes some people would get them shipped on dry ice
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:50.980]   and pay a lot of money,
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.780]   like a lot of money to have them shipped on dry ice.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.620]   - People are funny.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.180]   - I know, I kind of want to like name drop
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.020]   'cause it was Tom Brady used to order them.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.140]   - Oh, that's awesome.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:06.100]   - Yeah, they would order those shipped on ice to Boston.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.340]   - Oh yeah, continuing on.
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.180]   In 2011, you meet Anthony Stranges on Twitter
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.060]   and then in real life, also around this time,
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.980]   I think before you got your rescue dog,
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.260]   a pit bull named Leon.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.060]   - Yeah.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.060]   - 2011, 2010, do you remember?
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.860]   - It was September, 2010.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.580]   So, 'cause I think he was born roughly around March.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.660]   I gave him a designated birthday of March 10th, 2010.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.060]   - Why is that, why March 10th?
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:41.380]   - I wrote about the story of adopting him on my website
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.380]   a long time ago and then I reposted it here
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.580]   on my current website.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:49.140]   And what happened, I got weirdly obsessed with Leon
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.020]   before he was Leon.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.660]   He was a dog in a shelter named Quinn
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.140]   and I couldn't stop thinking about him.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.500]   - Him specifically.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.540]   - Him specifically, yes.
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.340]   - You saw him and there's something very special about him.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.660]   - I was trying to convince somebody else to adopt a dog.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.260]   So, and I--
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.540]   - Alec Baldwin.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.860]   - Yeah, and it didn't occur to me that I would get a dog.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.620]   - I like how you didn't name drop him,
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.980]   but you named drop Tom Brady.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.900]   (laughing)
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:13.380]   I like it.
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:18.260]   - So, I was trying to convince him to get a dog
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.500]   'cause I thought he should have a dog.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   I saw Leon's picture and just got weirdly obsessed with it
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.260]   in a way that I couldn't really explain.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.460]   And I was laying in bed one night and thinking,
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.980]   I just couldn't stop thinking about him, the dog.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:38.500]   And the paper, or his description in the shelter bio
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.740]   said that he was roughly five months old.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.620]   Or however, whatever it gave us his age, I went back
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.780]   and it would have been March 20,
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.140]   would have been March of that year that he was born.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.620]   And I had a cat that I was particularly attached to.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.780]   I had two cats, brother and sister,
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.020]   but the boy cat, we had sort of like a,
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.740]   something that felt like a, you know,
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.380]   like we'd look at each other and like,
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.420]   there was something there.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:05.620]   I don't know what it was, but,
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.180]   and in fact, when he got sick,
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.500]   I knew it before he even had any symptoms.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.580]   It was like something in the way that he looked at me,
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.620]   I knew something was wrong.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.580]   And then--
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.660]   - Was it friendship?
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.980]   Was it like, was there a power dynamic?
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.980]   Cats seem to not really--
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.100]   - Give a fuck?
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.020]   - Yeah, they seem to dismiss you.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.340]   - Usually, yeah.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.340]   - Your entire worth as a human being in a single look,
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.860]   was that there or?
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.420]   - He was more dog-like.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.580]   He would occasionally fetch,
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.900]   like this little styrofoam thing I had,
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.260]   he would fetch it and bring it back.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.300]   And he was friendly and, you know,
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.220]   if somebody came over, he would jump in their lap.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.660]   He was less standoffish than most cats,
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.740]   but there was just something
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:55.460]   about the way he would look at me, I don't know.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:59.460]   And I, maybe, probably in his mind,
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.700]   he's just a cat, I give him food.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.180]   Whereas in my mind, it's some kind of,
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.740]   you know, great soul connection.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.180]   - Great, great long running romance.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.260]   - Not in his kitty mind, but either way,
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.780]   so he died in March and I thought,
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.300]   so I sort of concocted this,
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.460]   I just thought, you know, that,
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.260]   well, if he died and he died on March 10th,
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.820]   and so I thought, well, maybe Leon was born that same day.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.580]   And that's why I'm so drawn to him.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.180]   I don't know.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.980]   - No, that makes, okay, that makes sense.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.300]   - It's one of those things that is sort of--
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.940]   - When you saw him, you just, like, there's something--
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.060]   - It was his picture, yeah.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.300]   - Oh, the picture, and you were drawn
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.940]   something about the personality in the eyes.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.500]   - It was something about his picture.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.460]   I don't know what it was.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:54.740]   And everybody at the time was like,
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:55.540]   what are you thinking?
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:56.660]   Why would you get a dog?
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.180]   You can't, you know, can't even take care of yourself.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.940]   You're overworked and busy.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.540]   And why would you get a five-month-old pit bull mix?
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.980]   You know, why not get an older dog
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.180]   that's easier to take care of?
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:12.180]   And for me, it was like, I don't want any dog.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.380]   I don't want, my intention isn't to get a dog,
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.500]   but there's something about this dog that I have to get.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.340]   And so I went to see him,
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:25.940]   and then I had already filled out an application.
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.260]   It was just, I went to see him,
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.500]   and then I, it was the afternoon,
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.700]   and I sort of decided in my head, like,
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.940]   all right, I'm coming back to get him, I have to.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.540]   And so the next morning I got on the subway,
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.460]   I went back to get him, and I was crying on the subway.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.820]   And I remember thinking that people,
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.980]   I don't like crying in public.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.580]   I cry a lot, but I don't like crying
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.460]   in front of other people.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.220]   And-- - I love it.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.540]   (Dana laughs)
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.620]   - I thought people on the train looking at me
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.820]   probably think that, you know, I just, somebody died or--
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.980]   - Sorry, you're crying on the way there or on the way back?
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.340]   - On the way there to get him.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.500]   And I don't know why I was crying.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.500]   It was just something about it was overwhelming, so.
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   - So tears of happiness or tears of something?
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.260]   - Something, yeah.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.220]   I think tears are overwhelming.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.660]   And now I'm like jumping off,
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.620]   but there was some, I don't, now I'm trying,
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.540]   was it in your conversation or the book,
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.260]   Karl Deisseroth talks about tears of joy
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.700]   and trying to explain them.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.980]   And he said something about how it was like about,
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.900]   you know, 'cause tears of sadness could be understood
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.700]   in a having like a evolutionary purpose,
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.340]   but why tears of joy?
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.500]   And I think he said it was something about like,
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.380]   hope that could be like lost.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.460]   So if you cried at a wedding,
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.820]   it might be like you're crying
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.700]   because their love is beautiful
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.540]   and you're crying because, you know,
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.100]   they could get hit by a bus tomorrow or something,
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.620]   you know, like it had something to do with that.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.460]   And I thought, but I thought,
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.740]   to me it feels like overwhelmed
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.980]   'cause then how would that explain music?
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.300]   'Cause music will make me cry a lot.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:11.380]   - No, because it's anything beautiful, like love,
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.340]   you realize you're gonna have,
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.260]   it's gonna be over one day.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.620]   - Or it's just overwhelming.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.140]   - It could be overwhelming.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.340]   - I think it's just overwhelming.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.740]   - But it could, like if you had to explain,
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.180]   like one way to explain it, as you're saying is,
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.860]   it's so awesome that it breaks your heart
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.900]   that it's gonna be over.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.340]   This feeling is gonna be over,
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:37.140]   the, either it's the song or the person,
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.420]   you're gonna lose them one day.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.380]   - But even when you're just watching something
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.300]   that this is completely ridiculous,
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.500]   but I remember one time I probably was hormonal
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.580]   or something, but it was like an episode
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.620]   of "Family Feud" years ago and the fam,
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.980]   oh no, "Wheel of Fortune."
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.940]   - Yeah. - It was "Wheel of Fortune."
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:57.620]   And some family like won all this money
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.460]   and they were so happy, like it just,
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.140]   they were so happy,
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.060]   they must probably needed the money or something.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.340]   And I started crying and I'm thinking,
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.100]   why am I crying?
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.220]   But I think it's just like an overwhelming,
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.140]   I think it's overwhelming in some way.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.740]   - On the surface. - And crying, like crying,
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.300]   it's crying as a relief, like you feel better
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.540]   after you cry.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.340]   - No, but that's not, doesn't explain the crying.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.700]   You feel better after you cry
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.020]   and you're saying it's overwhelming,
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.140]   but that's on the surface.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.100]   The question is what's going on underneath.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.580]   That's the yin-yang shadow.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.260]   And I don't think neither you or I
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.620]   can answer that question.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.420]   - Right. - But there's something
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.060]   going on underneath. - Right.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.220]   There's probably something that touches you
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.420]   in some specific way.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.140]   - Yeah. - And so you were crying
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:41.780]   on the subway.
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.540]   - So I was crying on the subway.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.980]   - It's a very New York thing to do.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.620]   - Yeah, well, that's one of the things I love
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.580]   about New York is people,
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.260]   you can be weird and do strange things
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.420]   and nobody's gonna look at you strangely or.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.500]   - The fascinating thing about New York,
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.380]   it's super crowded
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.660]   and yet you can still feel super alone.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.940]   - But also energized
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.100]   'cause a lot of other things and places
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.300]   will make me feel depleted,
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.540]   but there's something about the energy of New York
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.780]   specifically that feels energizing.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:18.020]   - I mean, everybody is going about their day,
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.660]   excited for a future they're building and so on
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.100]   and that could be energy.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:26.100]   Sure, sure.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.020]   It could be overwhelming though.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.020]   - It can be, yeah.
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.180]   I mean, also depending on what neighborhood
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.380]   and what part.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.820]   - Well, I'm just talking about the subway.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.500]   - Right, yeah. - The subway.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.420]   And then there's the musicians.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.140]   I love New York.
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.300]   New York at its best is a special place.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.980]   I've never lived, but every time I visit,
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.820]   it's so many characters, so many fascinating people.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.420]   - Yeah. - And then there's a bunch
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.180]   of people always crying in the subway
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.380]   and you're one of those people.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.540]   - I was one of those people one day, yeah.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.140]   - And so you got-- - I befriended some
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.500]   busking musicians, like the guys that just
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.340]   play out on the street,
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.700]   these two young guys playing guitar
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.060]   and I felt like it was one of those moments
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.060]   where it was like candid camera
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.660]   because nobody was paying attention
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.460]   and I thought it was like,
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.820]   "It was so beautiful, I may have cried or almost cried."
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.780]   But anyway, I ended up becoming friends with them
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.940]   and helping them out in some ways.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:20.180]   And I knew, I was like, "Well, they're gonna do really well."
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:25.220]   And now they're playing large places
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.180]   and it's kind of fun to watch via Instagram.
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.660]   They're going on tour in Europe
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.260]   and they were these two scrappy guys.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.620]   Well, now it's just one of the guys
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:40.020]   but they had no money, nowhere to live, nothing.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.620]   And another-- - And they didn't quit.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.500]   - They were on tour, no. - Persisted, that's cool.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.300]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.260]   But I cried on the subway and I got there
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.900]   and he was there and I adopted him.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.820]   But it just felt very profoundly
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.180]   like a force that was beyond me.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.820]   Like I couldn't not get him.
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.460]   - So he was the same in person as he was in the picture?
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:12.500]   Meaning in terms of something pulling you towards him?
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.220]   - Yeah, when I first met him the day before,
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.860]   he was really distracted, which I think is,
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:22.500]   he is a puppy that spends most of his day in a cage,
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.700]   which is not natural.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.380]   So when I, they let me take him for a walk
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.260]   and he was kind of distracted and all of the place.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.900]   But then when we put him back in the cage,
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.060]   he sort of lay down and looked at me
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.500]   and I looked back at him.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.140]   And of course I imagined all kinds of,
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.980]   I just looked at him and I thought, all right,
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.140]   don't worry, I'm coming back to get you.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.740]   Like I'll get you.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:50.580]   So yeah, it just, it felt like,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:55.700]   it felt like something that I had no choice
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.820]   that I had to do.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.820]   - And that was the beginning of a 12 year journey together.
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.060]   - An ongoing one.
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.860]   But so I wrote about these things on my website
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.220]   and I think it was among the many things
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:15.300]   that was later weaponized by Anthony Strange's.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.660]   - Oh, the fact that there's something close to your heart.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:22.100]   - Yeah, and also just, it's not like I believe
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.060]   that he was, I was just expressing my feelings
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.740]   about how I felt going to get him,
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.460]   that there was something about Leon
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.700]   and specifically that I, it was like,
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:32.820]   I felt like I had to get him.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:37.300]   - Is there words you can put to your connection with Leon?
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.340]   Like, is it love?
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.780]   Is it friendship?
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.340]   Is it some kind of, like, what is it?
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:52.980]   Or are we getting to the crying and being overwhelmed?
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.660]   Something you just can't put words to?
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.340]   - Yeah, it's probably something that's hard to put words to.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.180]   Kind of like, I sort of feel like,
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:05.940]   love being something that's hard to define
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.740]   is part of, is the definition.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:09.620]   - Of love?
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.540]   - The fact that you can't define it.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.980]   - The moment you define it,
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.340]   you're no longer talking about love?
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.180]   - Sort of, something like that.
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:16.900]   - Okay.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:17.860]   - So.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.020]   - Well, my definition of love
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.620]   is whatever's going on in true romance.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:22.900]   I don't know.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.460]   Let me fly through the timeline
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.460]   before we get to any of the interesting details.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:34.340]   So, in 2011, you meet Anthony Strangis.
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.140]   Then in 2012, you two get married.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:43.140]   2015, the staff walk out due to failure to pay
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.140]   from the two restaurants.
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:48.660]   It reopens in April of 2015.
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.900]   And July of that year, there's another walkout, and so on.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.060]   All this kind of stuff.
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.020]   - It's a confusing timeline.
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.260]   - Well, to me, that's not even,
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:03.300]   the point is in 2015, there's chaos happening.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:03.800]   Okay.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:08.980]   2016, in the spring, pure foods and wine closes.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.700]   - It closed in 2015.
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.820]   - 2015, okay.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.860]   There's some factual stuff that's not,
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.300]   yeah, maybe correct me on it.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.580]   To me, it's not that important.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.500]   To me, the spirit of the thing is important.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.780]   Okay.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:27.780]   May 12, 2016, you and your then-husband, Anthony Strangis,
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.380]   were arrested after he ordered pizza using his real name.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.660]   Okay.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.740]   In May 2017, you pleaded guilty to stealing
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.900]   more than $2 million from investors
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:43.060]   and scheming to defraud, as well as,
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.180]   this is from Wikipedia.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.380]   - Yeah, I got it wrong.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.460]   - Well, let me just finish reading it,
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.060]   and then you tell me why it's wrong.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.020]   In May 2017, you pleaded guilty to stealing
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.180]   more than $2 million from investors
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.340]   and scheming to defraud, as well as,
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.100]   criminal tax fraud charges.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.580]   Why is Wikipedia wrong, and how dare you?
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.100]   - (laughs) Well, I mean, I did plead guilty to those things,
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.420]   which I had to, oh, I was,
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.380]   I got a jury duty summons,
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.940]   and I had to fill out what charges I pled guilty to,
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.300]   and I had to go online and look it up,
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.780]   because I didn't really remember,
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.220]   which is, I thought that was interesting.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.380]   I had to go look it up, but--
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:22.500]   - Actually, let me finish the time,
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:23.380]   'cause there's one more point.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:23.880]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:29.060]   - March 16th, 2022, bad vegan documentary comes out,
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.060]   where you're interviewed.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.700]   There's, they tell the story.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:34.200]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.620]   - Some stuff is true, some is not.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.780]   Some is disturbingly misleading, as you said.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.060]   Okay, timeline over.
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.900]   Anyway, what's wrong with the,
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.540]   how would you elaborate onto the,
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:51.060]   you pleading guilty for $2 million stealing?
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.700]   - So, a lot of people plead guilty when they're,
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.380]   for reasons other than they're actually guilty.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:00.340]   So, you know, it's, even right now,
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.780]   if I knew that I was gonna have to spend four months,
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.740]   or three and a half, at Rikers,
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.940]   and I was thinking about this recently,
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.140]   and even if I knew that I'd be acquitted
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.500]   at the end of a trial, I very,
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:21.620]   likely would have just taken the four months,
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:26.580]   because, you know, the stress of going through a trial,
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.740]   but in particular, it'd be incredibly stressful,
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:29.780]   not knowing the outcome.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.300]   And then money and expense I didn't have,
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.180]   and so, you know, people plead guilty all the time,
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.660]   even if they don't think that they should.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.500]   And my situation was so complicated,
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.500]   and hard to understand,
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.940]   that it just was the easier thing to do.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.140]   But also, I just was kind of going on the advice of lawyers.
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:54.820]   - So, the choice, just so I understand,
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:59.300]   was to plead guilty, or to go through a lengthy trial?
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.100]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:05.620]   - And that trial would stretch a long time,
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:07.140]   and it would be extremely stressful.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.500]   - And extremely expensive.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.260]   Because you have to pay the lawyers.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:11.860]   - Right, and I didn't have anything.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.060]   - Right.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.580]   And so, a lot of people in that situation
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.820]   might choose to plead guilty.
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.500]   And so, that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.660]   the full heaviness of that statement of guilt.
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:28.180]   - Right, and I think people plead guilty all the time,
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:30.260]   in situations where they're being threatened with,
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.820]   like a heavy sentence,
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:36.180]   and they sort of feel like they have no choice.
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.980]   But that's kind of part of a lot of things
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.140]   that are messed up about the system overall,
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.140]   that didn't necessarily apply in my case.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.660]   - So, we'll talk about to what degree you're guilty,
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.540]   and what that even means.
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:54.980]   'Cause it depends on intention, I think.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:58.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:00.100]   But then the word intention
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.540]   also means a lot of things, like the word love.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.740]   - That's true.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.260]   - That's true.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:06.980]   - All right.
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:10.580]   - So, the restaurant closed the first time,
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:16.340]   when I was away and told to be off communication.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.020]   And then I-- - By Anthony.
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:20.520]   - Yes.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.540]   And then--
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.180]   - He told you not to talk to anybody.
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.420]   - He told me not to open email,
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:27.860]   or look at my phone, or whatever.
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:32.500]   And so, when I came back,
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.340]   and had to get it reopened,
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.940]   which seemed like an unbelievably difficult task,
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.180]   and I was kind of shocked that I was able to pull it off.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.740]   I worked incredibly hard to get it reopened.
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:52.740]   And because that place meant everything to me.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.540]   And so, I just had to get it reopened.
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.420]   - Were you surrounded by people that were just angry at you?
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.700]   - At that time?
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:00.420]   - Yeah. - Well--
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.460]   - The staff and all that.
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.220]   - Yeah, but most of them came back.
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.420]   A lot of them came back.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.060]   I think what was so unbelievably painful
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.260]   about that whole time,
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:14.580]   was not being able to tell anybody
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:15.780]   what was really going on.
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:17.140]   And in a sense, not really knowing
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.180]   what was going on myself,
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.020]   but not being able to,
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.780]   like having to pretend all the time,
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:22.900]   was just like--
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:26.740]   - So, you didn't really tell anybody about Anthony.
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:29.300]   - About him and what was really going on.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.740]   In part, because I didn't really understand
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:31.460]   what was going on.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.460]   So, what I did was I raised money
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.980]   to reopen the restaurant.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:38.260]   And I think I raised something like eight,
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.900]   maybe like 900 grand.
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:46.260]   And probably 90% of that went to reopen the restaurant.
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:51.140]   And I even made two sales tax payments
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.900]   right before we disappeared.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:57.220]   So, it just sort of logically seemed like--
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.340]   So, it's not like all of this money was taken
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:03.220]   and then he and I ran off together
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.260]   with a whole bunch of money.
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.500]   It was like, I raised a bunch of money
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.700]   to reopen the restaurant,
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.460]   because I wanted the restaurant to exist again.
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.500]   And I wanted to run it.
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.660]   I wanted to reopen the restaurant.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.620]   And most of that money went to reopen the restaurant.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.740]   And then I disappeared.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:29.540]   So, sort of the timeline gets a bit wonky.
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.180]   So, this impression was created
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:34.660]   that we ran off with a whole bunch of money
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.620]   and we didn't.
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:38.740]   So, if I wanted to be a criminal
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:39.780]   and steal a bunch of money,
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:43.220]   why would I have put it all back into the restaurant
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.420]   and reopened it?
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:48.660]   And then also made two $10,000 sales tax payments
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.220]   that I didn't--
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:55.380]   And I also repaid $10,000 of another loan.
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:57.380]   I was making repayments and stuff.
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.900]   And then boom, I disappear.
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:02.820]   - So, is your mind going through a roller coaster here?
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.940]   So, could there have been multiple yous there?
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.700]   So, one mind is like, I love this restaurant.
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.820]   I'm going to reopen it.
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:15.940]   I'm this chef, business owner, this person.
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.580]   And then the other is a human
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.020]   that's in this complicated love affair.
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.020]   - It wasn't a love affair.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:24.740]   - Okay.
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.540]   These are just words.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.180]   How can I?
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:28.420]   Okay.
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:35.220]   I don't want to, I say that lightly, but also not.
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.900]   Because love can make us do dark things.
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:41.780]   And you can say that's not love, but okay.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.140]   The thing that traps us,
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:48.340]   the things that pulls us in to a connection
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.900]   with another human being, that's love.
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:53.860]   Even when it's abusive and dark and toxic
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:54.980]   and all those kinds of things.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.860]   - In some cases, I think, like if it's voluntary,
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:01.220]   but in other cases, somebody pulls you in.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.500]   So, it's not like you're drawn towards them.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.100]   They pull you in.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.060]   - So, just to clarify, even when it's not physical,
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:13.220]   when the pull is with words, so it's emotional.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.500]   - Yeah.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.540]   - Okay.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:22.660]   Where is your mind when you raise eight to $900,000
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.940]   to open the restaurant?
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:28.580]   Working your ass off to open this thing, okay?
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:31.940]   Making payments and then all of a sudden disappearing.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.580]   Where was your mind?
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:38.740]   If you had a lengthy conversation with Carl Deisseroth
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.140]   in privacy, what would you be telling him
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.020]   as your therapist?
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.540]   - I would probably be asking him questions.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.780]   - Okay, no, we'll get Carl as part of this.
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.940]   - Well, and actually, I have more questions
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:55.060]   for Andrew Huberman because I've had to investigate
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.620]   all of these things myself, like dissociation.
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:04.180]   And even, there's a psychologist who believes
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:07.380]   that he must have used neurolinguistic programming on me,
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:09.300]   which is something that Keith Ranieri
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.740]   from the NXIVM cult, he was known to have used that
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:13.240]   with people.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.940]   And I think neurolinguistic programming
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:19.940]   is kind of the same as, like a sort of like hypnotism.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:23.620]   - The only reason I know what NLP is,
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.420]   is because in what I do, there's something called
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.140]   natural language processing, artificial intelligence stuff.
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:31.780]   So it has the same like three letters.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.420]   - Right.
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:36.260]   - What was the other thing that NLP, neurolinguistic--
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.380]   - Neurolinguistic programming.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.100]   - Programming, yeah.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:42.820]   Anyway, all right, well, we talked about Andrew,
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.420]   my friend Andrew Huberman offline,
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:46.500]   and you definitely should, you should do a podcast with him.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.300]   He's a fascinating, he's such a brilliant
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.100]   and kind human being, definitely worth talking to.
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:54.820]   - Yeah, I've listened to a lot of his podcasts.
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.300]   - And you said that you listened to a lot
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.140]   of his instructions on getting light in the morning
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.980]   or whatever during the day, it's very important
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.380]   for your mental, like there's all these kinds of studies,
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.220]   it's good for your mind, for your--
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.780]   - Oh, and also the other thing that he got me to do
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.180]   is to try to delay having coffee.
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.260]   So instead of having coffee right when you wake up,
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:17.700]   I always drink a lot of water first.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.180]   - Yeah.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.340]   - But then instead of having coffee right away,
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:24.100]   if you wait an hour or an hour and a half or two hours,
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:28.500]   then your body is able to naturally do something
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.900]   that drinking coffee too soon would sort of blunt that,
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.900]   so then you'll be more tired in the afternoon.
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:37.060]   So if you wait an hour and a half or two hours,
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:39.860]   or as long, you know, before you have your first cup of coffee,
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:41.860]   then you won't be as tired in the afternoon.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:42.980]   - Interesting.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.180]   - There's a lot of--
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:44.900]   - Does it work?
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:45.780]   - Yes.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.340]   - One coffee addict talking to another coffee addict.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.540]   - Yes, it works.
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:52.900]   And so I try to get up and do other things first
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:55.460]   before I have coffee.
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:56:01.140]   So, and the light thing also makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:04.020]   Getting light early in the morning,
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:06.340]   I have one of those bright light boxes,
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.420]   and I would love to have an apartment
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.020]   that had a little deck or something
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.460]   where I could just step outside,
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.660]   'cause when you live in an apartment,
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:16.820]   you kind of have to like go all the way outside
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:18.100]   and then there's people everywhere.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.740]   And so to get that early morning light,
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:22.100]   isn't that hard to do when you're--
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.860]   - Are people good for you or bad for you?
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.700]   What does Andrew Huberman say about that?
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.140]   I'm just kidding, it's a joke.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:30.020]   Okay, so moving back to where was your mind
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.420]   that led you to disappear to what,
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:35.540]   did you guys go to Vegas first and then to Tennessee?
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.860]   - No, I kind of refer to it as like the road trip
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:38.340]   from hell.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:41.140]   - It's a very Hunter S. Thompson way to describe it.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.020]   - Right.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:44.100]   - You went back to back country.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.420]   - Maybe it was sort of Hunter S. Thompson-esque,
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.140]   except without actual drugs.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:53.380]   That was one of the first questions my father asked me,
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.420]   was it drugs?
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:56.660]   And I wished that I could have said yes,
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:59.380]   'cause I didn't know how to explain what had happened.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:01.460]   But--
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.060]   - So road trip from hell.
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:05.780]   - He took me away involuntarily,
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.220]   except of course he wasn't holding a gun to my head,
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:12.980]   but all along it was like a metaphorical gun.
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:15.540]   - Was there ever physical abuse?
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:22.900]   - No, what would qualify as sexual abuse, yes.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.340]   But physically, no.
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:30.660]   A couple of times we would get into slightly physical fights,
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:31.300]   but he never,
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:40.260]   I mean, he was big and as large and blubbery as he was.
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:42.420]   He was also really strong.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:45.060]   So sometimes he would like subdue me,
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:47.780]   but other than that, no, there wasn't physical violence.
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:49.460]   But a lot of people will say that
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:52.900]   the psychological violence is,
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:58.020]   I don't wanna diminish physical violence,
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:00.340]   but some people say that the psychological
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:02.500]   and emotional violence is more destructive.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.180]   - It's just that the physical violence is easier to identify.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.780]   - It's easier to identify,
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.620]   and it seems kind of more straightforward.
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.780]   Whereas psychological,
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.180]   and you have a bruise on your face or you break a bone
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:17.460]   and those things hopefully heal in a visible way.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:19.780]   But psychological stuff,
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:25.460]   you can't easily identify or understand
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:27.460]   or others can't easily identify it.
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:30.740]   - And then you find yourself crying for no reason
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.340]   at a beautiful song at some point.
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:32.980]   - Yes.
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.540]   - And it's that has to do something happening
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.180]   in the depth of your mind.
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:40.180]   Okay, so he took you away,
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:44.180]   but where was, I mean, where was your mind
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.100]   that was doing both of those things,
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:47.620]   was able to be taken away,
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:53.060]   but also was pushing to the flourishing,
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.140]   the reopening and the flourishing of the restaurant?
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:58.020]   - Well, I wouldn't have reopened the restaurant
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:00.820]   and then knowing I was gonna all of a sudden
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:01.860]   be taken away from it
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:03.300]   and it was gonna get closed again.
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.220]   You know, it's like, why would I do that?
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:06.340]   Why would anybody do that?
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:11.940]   And one of the things that I tried to do towards the end was,
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:14.100]   I was trying to get myself off the bank accounts
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.740]   because I didn't want him to be able to get money out of me.
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:19.620]   And so there was one time
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:21.220]   when I tried to get one of the investors,
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.580]   we went to the bank together
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.140]   to put her on as the signer and take me off.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:28.020]   And because we didn't have the operating agreement,
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.060]   they wouldn't let us do it.
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:30.580]   So it was like this little snafu
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:34.260]   and so all of these things are
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:38.020]   sort of the opposite of criminal intent.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.020]   - But that's a legal thing.
[00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.100]   What's going on in your mind at this time?
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.020]   - I don't know.
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:44.260]   I mean-
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:47.220]   - Were you, oh, did you give yourself
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.420]   a chance to just think?
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.060]   - No, and I think that's part of,
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:56.500]   one of the things that might have saved me
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.540]   or anybody that's pulled into a cult,
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.900]   one of the things that they do
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.580]   is they keep you exhausted,
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.540]   overwhelmed, confused, and afraid.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:10.020]   And so you don't have any time to think.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.700]   So you're just kind of constantly running
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.180]   and you're confused and then things are happening.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.900]   That's funny, I have some quotes in my book draft
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.340]   because I listen to a lot of podcasts.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.900]   I don't know what the logistics are
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.780]   of like crediting a quote from a podcast in a book.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.260]   - Yeah.
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:28.020]   - But I have a couple, I think it was Andrew Huberman
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:32.420]   on Joe Rogan said something about,
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:37.220]   if a animal, if a human or animal,
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.500]   I don't know how he would know,
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.100]   if a human or animal is stressed,
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:44.100]   and I'm paraphrasing this horribly,
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:49.140]   but they're much more easily prone to be,
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:52.740]   not prone to, but forced into delusional thinking.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:56.580]   And so that quote resonated for me
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.540]   because he kept me in this incredibly stressed out,
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.300]   afraid, confused state.
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.780]   And then whatever he's sort of planting in my mind,
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.140]   I'm gonna be that much more likely
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.140]   to just kind of go along with it.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.740]   - Well, we'll see how this whole journey ends.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.740]   Let's actually just step back a little bit
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.220]   and just looking at the employees of the restaurant and so on.
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.260]   Do you have remorse for what happened,
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.300]   especially from the perspective of the employees and the staff?
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:25.220]   - Yeah, I mean, hurting them was sort of the last thing
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.580]   that I would ever have wanted to do.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:31.220]   And in part, I mean, there was financial harm,
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:37.060]   but I don't know whether it's more important or not,
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.580]   but it was taking a place
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.060]   that was very much like a family to them.
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.660]   And it was as if I destroyed it.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:52.260]   And so I think that because we were so much like a family,
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.020]   it was almost as if like mom went off the deep end
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:00.820]   and got together with some cuckoo abusive guy
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.580]   and sort of abandoned them
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:03.860]   and they didn't know what was going on
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:04.740]   and what was happening.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.980]   - So do you regret lying to them?
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:13.380]   - I regret lying to anybody in all of those circumstances,
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:16.340]   but I wasn't lying.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.540]   He made me think that everything was gonna be reversed
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.900]   and okay and anybody that money was borrowed from,
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.060]   they would get it back, maybe tenfold.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.220]   And so it was this weird situation
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.420]   of having like one foot in his reality
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.420]   and potentially believing the things he was saying
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:42.820]   or even over time, wanting to believe them more and more
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.420]   because the alternative was so,
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.900]   the alternative was worse.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:49.940]   The alternative was like,
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:53.620]   was increasingly a bigger and bigger nightmare.
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.140]   - So there's this whole situation
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:57.220]   where you're constantly giving them money,
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.220]   you're constantly borrowing, borrowing money
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:04.340]   with this idea that it'll be repaid like 100X fold.
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:05.060]   - Right.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:06.820]   - It's kind of like, yeah.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.260]   - So it's sort of like lying to somebody
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.020]   because you're planning their surprise party.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.020]   You think like, well, I'm lying to somebody,
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:15.140]   but it's because there's a good reason.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:15.940]   - Yeah.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.100]   - You know, it's sort of, that's not a good example,
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.700]   but-- - But you could have
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:22.980]   not made it a surprise party and be like,
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.980]   pull them in onto the planning of the party
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:30.660]   and be honest about like everything that's happening,
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.660]   not in a negative way, but like get them in on the fact that,
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.300]   okay, I just need to give money to this guy,
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:43.620]   but we'll get, he is a super rich person of some kind
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.340]   and he'll repay.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.100]   - I mean, I wish I, well--
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:51.220]   - 'Cause you're holding on to this--
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.180]   - That's part of the torture is that you're isolated
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:58.260]   and unable to tell anybody.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.060]   - But you're not unable, or he was telling you,
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:03.060]   you're not allowed to say anything to anybody.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.980]   I mean, you're choosing not to say anything,
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.900]   but it's because of the sort of the weight of it,
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.380]   'cause it's embarrassing to sort of,
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.620]   is it embarrassing?
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.020]   It's something, I mean, why do you not tell others?
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.980]   What is that?
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.860]   What's happening to the mind where you don't tell others?
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:23.540]   - I don't know.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.060]   Part of why the story, everything that happened
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:31.700]   is hard to summarize and talk about in any concise way
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:37.700]   is that so much of it happens in this very slow, slow,
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.820]   slow way.
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:42.260]   And people always use the whole like frog
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.460]   in boiling water example,
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:47.220]   so that by the time you realize you're fucked,
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:47.860]   it's too late.
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:54.180]   And it seems hard to believe or understand other people
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.580]   because they see where you are or where you ended up
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.460]   and they think, well, how did you let that happen?
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.260]   Well, I don't know.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:04.020]   Would I have willingly destroyed my life
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.620]   and hurt all the people I care about
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.780]   and allowed my mother to get hurt?
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:11.220]   And I wouldn't have ever willingly done that.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.860]   So something else must have happened.
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:17.220]   And that's the part that's difficult to understand.
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.780]   - Let me ask you about another hard question.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:23.140]   Do you deserve most or all of the blame
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.460]   for the failure of the business
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.660]   or are others at fault too?
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.900]   - Well, the business didn't fail.
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.180]   It was doing well.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:38.500]   And so it's closing is like it was destroyed.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.140]   - And who deserves the blame for that?
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.820]   I'm asking from your perspective
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.340]   when you think about it.
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.420]   In the privacy of your mind,
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:51.540]   are you angry at Anthony or are you angry at yourself?
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.860]   - Both.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:58.820]   I think that in the privacy of my own mind
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.900]   and to everybody listening,
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:05.700]   I feel responsible.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.340]   I feel responsible in the same way
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.740]   that if you kind of did something,
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:12.740]   if you were driving and you did something stupid,
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:15.300]   and caused an accident in which other people died,
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:19.060]   you would feel, I think, horrifically responsible.
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.660]   And you'd blame yourself
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.500]   'cause maybe you looked away
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.580]   or checked your phone or something.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:30.420]   But you didn't intend to kill those people, of course.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:34.580]   So for me, it's like, I didn't intend to kill.
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.820]   Sometimes I say like my own child.
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.420]   I don't know if that's offensive to some people,
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:42.580]   but it's like as if I killed my own child.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:43.220]   - Yeah.
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:46.020]   - Child, it was a business, but it was special.
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:52.500]   So I don't feel guilt.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.780]   I feel responsibility.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:59.540]   And then I'm angry at him
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:02.260]   even though that anger is pointless.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.900]   - Okay, because this has come up,
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.900]   let's continue with the hard questions.
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:11.060]   - Are they gonna get easier?
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:11.860]   - They're gonna get easier.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.660]   - Okay.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.940]   - Most of them are easy.
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:17.540]   This is fun, we're having fun.
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.820]   You posted on Instagram,
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:23.940]   the ending, no, I'm gonna cite Instagram
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:24.900]   like it's Shakespeare.
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:25.400]   - Okay.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.180]   - "The ending is disturbingly misleading,
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:31.300]   but still I'm very grateful for this coverage."
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.060]   Let's talk about the documentary, in quotes documentary.
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.100]   "I'm okay with the criticism and judgment,
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.420]   but would rather it be based on what's true."
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:43.380]   And then you say a couple more sentences.
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.500]   And then you say,
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.900]   Leon who has his own Instagram account.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.460]   - Yes.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.860]   - One lucky rescue dog says,
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.860]   "Hello, he loves you all.
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.020]   Even if you call me a quote,
[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.940]   defective, arrogant sociopath, it's all okay."
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.260]   So the hard question,
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:04.100]   do you think you are in part a sociopath?
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.140]   - No.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.060]   - Would you know it if you were?
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:07.700]   - Yes.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:08.740]   - How does this work?
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.420]   So what have you learned from reading this book?
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.340]   - I had all these interesting thoughts,
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.500]   all these sort of questions and thoughts about it
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.980]   because the book I'm reading now
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.580]   that I'm only about a third of the way through,
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:22.180]   she talks about some of the things in the brain structure
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.100]   that are particular to sociopaths.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.740]   And so then it makes you think,
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:30.980]   well, what if that could be tweaked in some way?
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:33.300]   Like, could you un-sociopath a sociopath?
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.220]   - Is it nature or nurture?
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.580]   I guess it poses the question.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.860]   - I think it's both.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:39.860]   I think it's genetic.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:41.940]   And then it's like genes that are turned on
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:48.580]   by things like a particularly violent childhood
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:50.100]   or some sort of a dysfunction.
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.260]   So I think somebody could have the gene,
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.460]   it's not turned on.
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:59.140]   And then the sociopaths have the gene and it's turned on.
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:05.060]   - So sociopath means that you're not able to be empathetic
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.740]   or you're generally not empathetic
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.500]   to the suffering of others
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.100]   or to the emotions of others?
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.620]   - It's a hollowness.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:12.900]   So it's like you don't have,
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:18.180]   just completely lacking the capacity.
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:21.860]   I mean, it's tragic because they wouldn't understand
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.500]   or feel love, but it's like a hollowness.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:30.420]   And then something also about the wiring,
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.980]   and I think also because of that hollowness,
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:38.020]   they're able to incredibly quickly look at others
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:44.660]   and identify their insecurities and buttons and weak spots.
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:47.780]   So they're incredibly good at manipulation.
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.060]   - Is that because they're just able
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.460]   to objectively observe the situation?
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.940]   I wonder-- - Probably in part,
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.780]   but there was some other explanation
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.940]   related to the brain structure that I read somewhere
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:58.980]   that made sense to me.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:02.180]   And I won't remember it 'cause I don't usually--
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.420]   - You're not Andrew Kuberman who seems to reference--
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.940]   - No, I'll listen to him. - Perfectly.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.700]   - Yeah. - Every single line
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:10.260]   from every book or paper he's ever read, yes.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.100]   - Right, I don't remember things in that way.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.100]   I try to usually remember the conclusions.
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.020]   - Right. - So like I might remember
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:19.460]   that he might give a whole long explanation
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:22.340]   about why it's good to do this or to take this supplement.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.180]   That's a bad habit I have.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.460]   Sometimes I'll order supplements,
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.700]   and then by the time they arrive, I've forgotten why.
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:28.900]   - Why? - I forgot why.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.180]   - Just take them all. - Supposed to take them all.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.780]   - It's the healthiest option, but the healthy version.
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:34.020]   - I hope we get to talk about food 'cause I feel like--
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.860]   - Yes, fluff. - You have a brain
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.740]   that should be fed only the best food.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.060]   - Oh, wow. - So we can talk
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.660]   about that later. - I have a lot of
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:45.540]   philosophies about that, but certainly fluff is not,
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.540]   and then best, what is best?
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:48.660]   We'll definitely talk about food.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.300]   Throughout, what is best?
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:55.780]   That makes me think of Conan.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:59.380]   And I just talked to Oliver Stone,
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.700]   who I didn't realize wrote "Conan the Barbarian."
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:05.220]   - Do you know that in my head, I pictured Conan O'Brien?
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:08.260]   That's what I was doing. - He's also one of the funniest.
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.500]   - I was sitting there going, wait, why is, I love him,
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.700]   but when you said that, I was like,
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.860]   why did that make you think of Conan O'Brien?
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.220]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.820]   - I love him so much.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.580]   He's such a brilliant human. - Yeah.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:23.460]   Sociopathy. - Sociopathy.
[01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:24.900]   - Yeah. - So it's stuff
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.340]   about the brain, fine, but how do you know
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.540]   you're not a sociopath?
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.940]   Would you know it, am I a sociopath?
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:33.140]   - No. - How would I know it?
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:34.180]   How do you know?
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.020]   - Well, having listened to a lot.
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:39.140]   - Well, wouldn't I be able to be good at faking it?
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:40.820]   Isn't that what? - Well, because you'd be out there.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:43.300]   - There's a mask on the cover of this book.
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.900]   - I don't think you would be doing the work
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.620]   that you're doing. - With lipstick.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:46.820]   I don't wear lipstick. - You'd probably be running
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:50.660]   for office or a trader on Wall Street or,
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:55.620]   one of the things about sociopaths is they kind of need
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:12:00.660]   like the stimulation of risk and danger.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:06.980]   - Well, I need, okay, sure. - More than average.
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:08.580]   - I like, hmm, okay.
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:12.020]   But Wall Street, there's a fakeness.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.140]   Like I don't like the fakeness of the game of it.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.060]   - Yeah, that's why I left.
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:21.060]   I didn't, I just, it was a strange environment.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:26.980]   - Okay, so you're not a, quote, "defective, arrogant sociopath."
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.340]   What does defective even mean?
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:30.740]   - I know, well, I think that somebody had just called me that
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:35.060]   and I think that, you know, it's easy for people to say,
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:38.660]   like, "Don't read the comments," but it's hard not to
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.340]   'cause then also you'd miss the beautiful ones.
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:42.660]   Or sometimes like you have to go on there
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:46.020]   to check a private message and you just, stuff,
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:49.140]   it's there, people saying terrible things.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:55.220]   So I try to, people say, you know,
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:56.340]   "Don't pay attention to the comments."
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:57.700]   It's hard not to, but I try to.
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:02.820]   - Even with the documentary, you try to still kind of see,
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:07.860]   to look for the good ones, for the kind ones,
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:08.900]   for the supportive ones.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:11.220]   - Well, there were overwhelming kind comments
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.740]   and so that helped and felt a lot better.
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:22.100]   But sometimes the negative comments are based on,
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.700]   you know, they're based on false information.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.180]   So if somebody knew everything that happened
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:30.420]   and then wanted to judge me or say things like that's somehow,
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.900]   at least that's all right.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:38.420]   But people saying these things based on things
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:44.580]   that are totally false is just, it's hard to just
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:45.380]   let that go.
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:50.740]   But I know that people also say things,
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:55.060]   you know, for their own personal reasons.
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:57.060]   I had a fascinating exchange with somebody
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:00.580]   who direct messaged me and called me trash.
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:02.580]   - And you responded?
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:07.060]   - I responded 'cause it was, no, it was amazing.
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.300]   So I would do this for a while.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:12.820]   It's sort of like, I might be procrastinating or,
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.660]   but I would scroll through,
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.700]   'cause the private messages were overwhelming
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.020]   and there's still just this massive backlog
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:22.100]   that I'll never probably get to read.
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.900]   - But the one that called you trash as a pick up,
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:27.940]   as an opener, you were like, this is interesting.
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:28.980]   - I just was in a mood.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:29.300]   - Yeah.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:34.500]   - And so I responded and I wish I hadn't deleted it
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.260]   'cause I sort of deleted a bunch.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.940]   And then I was like, oh, why did I delete that one?
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.100]   'Cause I was curious what exactly I said to him,
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.220]   but I responded to him.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.380]   In a nice way.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.540]   And then he responded back.
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.700]   And then it started this whole back and forth conversation.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:51.380]   - So he was kind quickly or no?
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:52.340]   - Yes.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.260]   And then also wanted to get to know me
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.980]   and lives in Pennsylvania and was like, I'll come to you.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:02.740]   And I'm like, do you realize if somehow this just turned into,
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:04.420]   that would be our, how did you meet story?
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.660]   Well, he called me trash online.
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:08.180]   - That's a pretty good, yeah.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:11.300]   - He ended up having such an insightful comment.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.220]   I just found it interesting.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:16.660]   And I think first he said, I never imagined you'd reply,
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.380]   which is, it's like part of the whole thing with social media.
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:20.740]   Although this guy wasn't anonymous.
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:23.220]   - Was not anonymous.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.540]   - No, I think he had a private account,
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.540]   but it's like his name and his face was there.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.700]   - Yeah, people forget that you're a human being
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.500]   when they message you.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:30.980]   - Exactly.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:33.540]   - Folks, when you message me, I'm a human being.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:38.180]   - So I told him that that was, that I was hurtful.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:38.740]   - Yeah.
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:42.820]   - And I guess I wanted to understand more why he said it.
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:45.940]   And it was surprisingly insightful,
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:47.620]   but he said something about, again,
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:48.500]   I wish I hadn't deleted it,
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:54.100]   but he was like, I guess I was just angry
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:16:00.660]   because like that guy, he said something like,
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:03.060]   I guess I was just angry 'cause that guy got you.
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.740]   - Oh, wow.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:07.540]   - And I would have, so it made me think of the whole
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:11.940]   like sort of in-cell jealousy thing
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:15.540]   that can be very terrifying if you're female,
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.780]   is that like, if you reject a guy,
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:22.020]   they might turn around and be violent or angry at you.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:22.580]   - Yeah.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.820]   - And so his-
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:27.860]   - Well, to be fair, there's a dormant anger
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:28.980]   in probably all of us.
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.700]   - Yes.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.580]   - I believe there's a capacity for cruelty and anger
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.260]   and destruction in all of us.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:39.300]   And the whole struggle of life is to emphasize the good stuff.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.740]   - Yeah.
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:41.780]   - Yeah.
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.380]   So it's not just an in-cell thing.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:47.380]   It's true for men and women, both capable of cruelty.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:49.060]   - That is very true.
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.420]   - But this one guy, so then you put on my therapist hat.
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:55.300]   What did we start with?
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:17:00.500]   I already forgot, but the, oh, Leon.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.420]   - You're coming back to sociopath, Leon.
[01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:03.780]   (laughs)
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.220]   No, just, you know, maybe it's not the best idea
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.980]   to answer comments that start with, "You're trash."
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.020]   - I don't do it all the time.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.540]   It's just, I happened upon that one
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.060]   and I was just in a certain mood.
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.180]   I was just in a certain mood.
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:19.620]   - Well, let's further offline sort of-
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:20.180]   - Yeah.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.380]   - Discuss this mood that you're in
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.900]   'cause it might get you in trouble
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:26.180]   at some point in your future.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:27.400]   Okay.
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:34.740]   Can we just jump back, speaking of guys that say,
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.180]   "As an opener, you're trash."
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:40.260]   How did you and Anthony Stranges meet?
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:43.220]   Can we jump around and tell some of the details here?
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:46.500]   'Cause I believe the documentary doesn't cover that well.
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.540]   It's not clear.
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:49.060]   There's some Twitter interactions
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:51.540]   and you've kind of assumed,
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:55.380]   by the way, I do think you need
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.980]   some social media coaching on this
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:58.820]   because I think, you know,
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:04.980]   I have some books you need to read, I think,
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.860]   some manuals on how to use Twitter properly.
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:10.660]   But anyway, apparently you kind of thought
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.540]   that this person who turned out to be,
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.140]   what was his name?
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.500]   He called himself Shane Fox,
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.900]   but he turned out to be Anthony Stranges,
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.940]   that he was somehow friends with Al Baldwin
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:24.020]   because of their friendly interaction on Twitter.
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.420]   And so you started interacting with him
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:29.940]   and then there was, how did that escalate quickly to-
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.620]   It escalated slowly.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:38.340]   And I think, I'm sure it was intentional
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.780]   because had I met him right away,
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.540]   I would have probably thought like,
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:44.820]   "Oh, he's not what I thought he was and no thanks."
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:49.380]   But it was a long time.
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:52.420]   It was many weeks of back and forth conversation
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:54.820]   digitally one way or another.
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:59.380]   So it was via Twitter and then via direct message.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.900]   And then we both played Words With Friends back then
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.580]   and we would message in Words With Friends.
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:07.620]   And then eventually we exchanged phone numbers.
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:10.020]   How does Words With Friends work?
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:10.520]   What's that?
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.060]   Words With Friends.
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:12.980]   I know that's a popular game.
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:14.180]   Is that like Scrabble?
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:17.060]   It's like Scrabble and you're playing other people
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.500]   and then there's like a chat function.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.300]   Yeah, and then you can chat with them.
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:21.540]   Right.
[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:24.420]   So you were, this intellectually stimulating game
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:27.540]   and you were what, like flirting and that kind of stuff.
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:30.100]   Like witty banter.
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.140]   Yes.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:32.660]   AKA flirting.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:34.260]   Yes.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:39.940]   And, but all of that lasted a really long time
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:42.900]   and he would give me like little tiny bits and pieces
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.180]   of information about himself
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.420]   that made him seem kind of mysterious.
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:52.180]   This is a dark, mysterious man who was a Navy SEAL, strong.
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:56.740]   Yeah, and he would always imply things versus say them outright.
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:59.220]   So you're kind of always guessing and filling things in.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.740]   Clint Eastwood type of character.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.180]   He's not going to say it outright.
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:02.820]   He's what?
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.500]   He's a Clint Eastwood type of character.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.780]   He's not going to say it outright.
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:06.100]   Right.
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.940]   He's just going to act badass.
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:08.260]   Yeah.
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:08.820]   Okay.
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:09.140]   All right.
[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:14.340]   And plus intellectual because of Words With Friends.
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:15.460]   Is that still a thing by the way?
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.940]   So I think it still exists.
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:18.100]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:21.860]   But I feel like if I started playing it again,
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:23.300]   I would get a little addicted and...
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.140]   But...
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:26.100]   Stick to the coffee addiction.
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.700]   One of the interesting things is that I used to think that he like
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.380]   used an app to look up things, but then he would do it in front of me.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:38.100]   He could like look at, he was really good at it.
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:43.140]   And he could look at the board and just like come up with,
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.860]   you know, a hundred point word that I'd never even heard of.
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:49.940]   So I think he had a little bit of that something going on
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:54.900]   in his brain that was like, I don't know, a little rain manish
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:57.780]   or something in the way that he was able to recall.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:00.500]   I think his recall is incredibly...
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.140]   It's important if you lie a lot.
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.660]   If you lie a lot, yeah.
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:05.860]   To have good recall.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:06.180]   Okay.
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:07.300]   So when...
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:08.660]   So, okay.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:15.140]   So how did it escalate slowly from Words With Friends to meeting in real life?
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:15.940]   Like what...
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:16.420]   You know what?
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:17.140]   I mean, what...
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:17.540]   Okay.
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.780]   I know it's not a love affair.
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:27.860]   That said, when did you kind of get hooked by the...
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:31.780]   Ooh, I wonder, you know, like fall in love.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:32.580]   I think it was just a slow...
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:35.060]   Yeah, when did you fall in love?
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:37.460]   It was a slow process.
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:41.780]   And I think he found me at a time when there was sort of a perfect storm
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:47.300]   of the right conditions for me to fall into whatever.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:52.660]   I fell into with him because that was heartbroken for the first time in my life.
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.980]   Where was the heartbreak coming from?
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:57.700]   I had split with my boyfriend of four years.
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:00.500]   And that broke your heart?
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:02.580]   I mean, it was...
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:05.700]   I knew it was a relationship that I knew would end,
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.100]   even when I got into it in the first place.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.700]   How did you know?
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.140]   He's 15 years younger than me.
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:12.340]   And...
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:16.420]   Surely that can't be the only reason it wouldn't work.
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:19.220]   I need to also give you a book on love.
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:21.700]   What's it called?
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:24.100]   I'm gonna write it.
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:24.660]   I don't know.
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:24.900]   Okay.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.340]   Just because it's called a joke.
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.860]   Because there's another book that I didn't bring.
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:28.180]   Okay.
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:31.300]   There's no book on Twitter and there's no book on love.
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:34.340]   Well, because there's actually a book on love that I really like,
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:35.460]   that I think you might like, but...
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:36.900]   What is it?
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:37.860]   Like love languages?
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:38.740]   I still have to read that one.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:40.260]   No, it's called On Love.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:42.420]   I can't wait.
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:42.980]   But...
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.660]   I'm gonna read the cliff notes.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.060]   Bye.
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:48.660]   It's short by this guy named Alain de Botton.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.860]   French name.
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.900]   I don't trust him already.
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:57.540]   No, it's funny and it's beautiful and shocking that he wrote it when he was very young.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:01.060]   And I first heard him on a Krista Tippett podcast.
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:04.980]   That's how I end up reading a lot of books, is like,
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.340]   here's somebody on a podcast.
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.580]   So...
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:09.300]   So...
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:10.100]   Love...
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:11.540]   So you were heartbroken.
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:12.820]   You knew it wasn't gonna work.
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:13.860]   I knew it wasn't gonna work because...
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:14.740]   Because of the age difference.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.180]   What else?
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.100]   That's just because of the age difference also.
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:22.660]   You know, I just knew that eventually he'd want to move on and probably he'd find somebody
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:29.540]   younger and/or was young enough that he still needed to go have a bunch of other experiences.
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:34.740]   And, you know, probably wanted a family or whatnot eventually.
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:39.860]   So he was 21 and I was 34 when we first met.
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:47.540]   But then we ended up living together for four years and it was the most drama-free,
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:50.100]   like there was no drama.
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:51.220]   And I had just come off...
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:54.340]   My prior relationship was Matthew Kenney, which was very
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:24:00.180]   dark in many ways and full of all kinds of...
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:04.180]   Yeah, and I just couldn't handle that.
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:04.660]   So...
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:06.420]   Can I ask you a personal question?
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:06.660]   Yes.
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.180]   Between us and...
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.940]   Between us, friends.
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:15.460]   Is there a part of you that's attracted to the drama and the chaos?
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:19.700]   Now, looking back.
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.460]   I feel like that happens a lot and...
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:32.340]   Maybe there was at some point, but I don't think so because, you know, part...
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.260]   What made that relationship work
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:42.980]   with his name was Tobin was that there was no drama, not at all.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:45.220]   And I don't think I could have handled it.
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:46.580]   And I feel that way now too.
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:49.380]   Like I just couldn't, I can't, like fighting or any kind of like
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.620]   the people being passive aggressive, I can't handle that.
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.100]   So...
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:58.980]   You've had enough storms, now you want the calm.
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:00.500]   Yes.
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:03.860]   So you knew it wasn't work?
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:05.860]   I knew it wasn't gonna be forever.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:10.660]   Well, that could be just insecurity and cynicism, but fair enough.
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.860]   And then the heart was broken.
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:14.020]   Yes.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:23.460]   And now the heart was broken and fragile and there to be manipulated in some sense.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:23.940]   Yes.
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:30.100]   And there's another person that I heard that I quoted my book saying that when your heart broke
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:36.740]   and you can't rely on your instincts, somehow your instincts are compromised when you're heartbroken.
[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:42.900]   And maybe I'm just like looking for excuses as to why this happened.
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:43.860]   No, no, it's true.
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:45.300]   But I was heartbroken and then...
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:50.260]   I like to see people when they're heartbroken because it's like
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:56.260]   shows how much they really love somebody, you know?
[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.260]   Yeah, it's...
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:06.500]   It's sad, but sometimes love doesn't reveal itself as richly when you're in it versus when you lose it.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.420]   Right, that's probably true.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:11.300]   Anyway, so your judgment wasn't good.
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:18.340]   Great, so now you're lonely and you're super busy running the restaurant,
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:22.180]   but when you get home, you're lonely or in between.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:25.540]   Yeah, and I was kind of overwhelmed and...
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:31.780]   But I'm sure you were getting a lot of really positive attention from other guys too while New
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:35.220]   York or New York were too busy.
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:39.300]   Well, no, because it was a restaurant, there was constantly...
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:45.780]   You're like constantly meeting people and really interesting people and New York is full of
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:50.020]   a lot of interesting people.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.500]   And you're, you know, attractive.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:27:00.820]   Why are you connected to some mysterious distant man from somewhere else playing overwords?
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:06.740]   Because, well, I think now looking back, I think it's 'cause I felt like he understood me and...
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:10.420]   What was that feeling coming from you think?
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:15.220]   Why does one feel that you're understood?
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:21.460]   One thing that made me extra easy to target is that I'd written a lot of very personal blogs
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:28.020]   and things, so in addition to him asking me questions and me probably just being insanely
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:33.300]   open and answering whatever he asked me, I had also written and posted a bunch of personal blogs.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:40.020]   Some of them I've reposted on my new website and then some of them I haven't, but in one of them,
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:47.700]   I go into detail about my frustrations professionally in growing the business.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:55.140]   And having read that and being a very smart person, he would have known kind of precisely
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:28:00.100]   what to say to get me drawn in.
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:08.980]   So I think by waiting so long before we met in person, he'd already gotten me hooked in a way
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:15.380]   that was gonna then make it possible for me to see him and even though he doesn't look like I
[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:23.060]   thought he did, I'll make excuses for it. I mean, that's a dangerous thing about when people...
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:26.740]   And I'm not saying I fell in love with him in this way, I feel like there's another explanation for
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:34.740]   what felt like love, but when people fall in love quickly, there's that danger that
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:41.620]   because that's what happens first, that the more you learn about them, you'll sort of rationalize
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:52.820]   away things that might be red flags or things that you don't like. So I think it's safer to
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:29:02.020]   fall in love when you get to know somebody not in the context of dating them like Jim and Pam
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:07.700]   on The Office. Did you watch The Office? Yeah, of course I watched The Office. British Office
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:16.820]   is better, strong words, but yes. So well, yeah, fine, true. It might be less romantic.
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:22.660]   Yeah, I like the romantic. You can fall for it. Yeah, it's fine. But just I think the better
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:27.380]   lesson is, yes, that's one thing to say, but the other is when you see the red flags,
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:33.700]   notice them, be a little better about noticing them even amidst the passion.
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:42.260]   What if a brilliant woman kind of threw herself in your path? Because talking on a podcast is a
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:46.420]   little bit like having a blog where you overshare because people learn everything about you,
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:53.140]   what you like, what you don't like, what your wants and dreams. So some woman could
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:59.300]   pretend to throw herself in your path seemingly accidentally, and then you meet.
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:02.740]   She has a Russian accent and probably works for FSB.
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:10.580]   No, but whatever. She is who she is, and then she sort of slides into the conversation like a
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:21.620]   quote from The Idiot, right? And you're like, boom. But she's not who she, that's all a pretend.
[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:26.820]   And so you very quickly could fall in love with her, and she's going to turn out to
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.540]   enjoy the game of destroying your life.
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:36.500]   Yep. That or it's the love of my life.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.060]   It could be, but not if she did all those things intentionally.
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:45.060]   But you don't really know. But you have to then pay attention to, that's the dark aspect here.
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:52.420]   You mentioned blog. I love when people have stuff about themselves online because you get to really
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:57.540]   learn. I mean, I'm a fan of podcasts. I'm a fan of people. I love learning about them, the personal
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:05.300]   stuff and so on, hopefully for good reasons. So the person, people you connect with, the good ones
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:10.500]   are the ones that are going to be very sort of empathetic, and the bad ones are the ones that
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:16.340]   are going to be fake empathetic. Like they're going to learn everything about you and use you
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:22.180]   to manipulate you, as opposed to learn everything about you to fall deeper in love with you as a
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.700]   friend or as a romantic partner.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.460]   Or like genuine curiosity.
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:30.420]   Yeah, genuine curiosity. Like there's something you're drawn, like imagine your dog Leon had a
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:34.820]   blog after, oh yeah, he does now. Yeah, that's true.
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:35.620]   He kind of does.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:43.140]   Yeah. But as when you met him, right? Then you'd be like, what is this? What is there that's pulling
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:49.060]   me towards this creature, this entity? Like what is there? And it'd be fascinating to learn more.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:54.740]   And then you fall in love with the details, not just with some kind of ethereal thing.
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:58.100]   Yeah, you don't know. You have to pay attention to the red flags. You have to-
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:03.380]   Yeah. I think one of them actually is somebody who doesn't have that kind of, I mean,
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:07.220]   plenty of people are private and they don't put stuff out about themselves online for all kinds
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:13.540]   of very valid reasons. But somebody who does share a lot about themselves personally is,
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:20.580]   maybe there's examples, but it's probably not a sociopath if they're sharing all kinds of-
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:27.700]   Sure, sure. But I mean, on the other side, when you meet people, yeah, I still like the falling
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:33.220]   in love. Because the red flags, whether you see them early or later, it doesn't matter. I'd rather
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:41.540]   see the red flags right away. I go in hard, intensely, to clarify, by going hard, I mean,
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:51.540]   no small talk. Just get to know a person, get to know quickly, get to know the person, challenge-
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:52.580]   Travel with them.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:57.380]   Travel with them is a really powerful one. The road trip from hell or not. Go on a road trip
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:59.540]   and find out if it's a road trip from hell. Yeah.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:02.660]   But you might, so there was somebody I was-
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:03.940]   This is also a male perspective.
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:10.820]   Destructive relationship with where we had already fallen in love and then went for the first trip.
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:18.340]   In a situation where we had to borrow, I guess he was still sharing his car with his ex-wife,
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:22.420]   so we had to go to the garage to pick up the car to go on this little trip. And-
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:25.220]   So you literally baggage the ex-
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.780]   That's, wow.
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:35.940]   Yeah. So, but something happened where the garage attendant was like, wanted more identification,
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:43.620]   and it was a pain in the ass. Anyway, this guy was so unbelievably rude to the garage attendant,
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:51.300]   like just nasty. And I was completely shocked and disturbed. And we got in the car for this
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:59.620]   long car ride, and I was like not saying anything and really shocked. And then he noticed that and
[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:07.860]   was very concerned. And I explained, I would never treat somebody that way. And then he
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:14.260]   pretended to get incredibly upset and to feel horrible and remorseful about it. And
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:20.900]   it was like all we talked about for the next few hours. And then I kind of thought like, well, okay,
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:25.620]   I can get over that. And then the relationship continued and it was a dark and destructive one.
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:32.500]   Whereas, had I seen him behave that way before we were in a relationship,
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:36.420]   I would have known to back away.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:42.020]   Okay. But the lesson, you could still walk away. You could still walk away.
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:47.540]   But, no, you can't. Well, I could have walked away at any point with, I call him Mr. Fox,
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:55.140]   because it's sort of depersonalizes him. But I could have walked away from him at any point in
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:35:02.740]   time. But that's kind of the whole point of what they do and the whole reason why people don't
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:11.380]   understand it. I mean, it's like being in a cult of one. So the people who've been in cults and
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:17.700]   gotten out, we understand each other very well, because the same psychology was used.
[01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:24.500]   The same psychological tactics were used on us. And then we experienced the same thing on the
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:28.100]   other side of it, which is it's hard for us to understand and it's hard for other people to
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:32.020]   understand. And everybody's saying, that would never happen to me. Or they're saying, I don't
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:35.460]   get it because you're smart. How could you let that happen? Why didn't you leave? Why didn't
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:41.700]   you walk away? And on the other side of it, we don't have the answers. Or it takes a really long
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:47.780]   time of self-reflection and reading and investigation to try and figure out how it is
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:53.380]   that it happened and why didn't we walk away. No, it's definitely hard at every level.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:36:06.020]   And I just think that even for more subtle, not outrageously toxic relationships, but normal toxic,
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:10.100]   not normal, a little bit toxic relationship. - There are some people that kind of thrive on
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:15.460]   conflict. - Yeah, but you could still just be self-aware. I think you've talked about,
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:22.980]   give yourself time to think about the red flags. And I pride myself on being able to walk away.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:33.540]   You have to think, is this the kind of thing I can live with in friendship and business partners?
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:40.340]   Because the little things that bother you turn out to be big things down the line.
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:48.020]   - Yeah, so it could be less romantic, but I feel like getting to know somebody
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:50.980]   slowly over time is... - Yeah, it's the smarter thing.
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:52.500]   - It's safer. - Fuck it though.
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:37:06.660]   - But that's again, my Russian/Ukrainian male perspective. Anyway, so, Meeting Mr. Fox.
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:11.300]   Anthony. - That's a chapter title in my book,
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.340]   Meeting Mr. Fox. - Meeting Mr. Fox. So you're working
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:20.100]   on a book about this. - I'm almost done. It's taken a really long time.
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:26.740]   - Can you define almost done? Because I've said that, it's when people say,
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:32.420]   they're leaving, I'm almost in the car. - Right.
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:34.740]   - And they actually... - But they're not really.
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:37.780]   - They're not really, they haven't even started the showering yet or something.
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:43.540]   - Yeah, I think I probably need some therapist to work with me on this.
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:47.060]   - Are you usually late to things? - No.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:49.140]   - Okay. - I'm usually
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:53.140]   late. Oh, I sent you a text message because I was early when I got here.
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:54.980]   - Yeah. - And I said that I'm,
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:38:05.060]   because of, I think I said my crippling fear of being late. I'm like always early.
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:11.300]   - So I'm loitering outside like a weirdo, but glad to come in if it's not too early.
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:16.660]   The crippling fear of being late makes me chronically early and today's no exception.
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:20.580]   - Yeah, it's interesting. - So I got here before I rang the bell.
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:22.580]   - Yeah, it was interesting outside. - I was outside for a little while,
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:27.620]   like just killing time going, I'm way too early, but it's really hot out.
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:32.340]   - Oh, that's true. - Yeah, because I always air,
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:36.260]   like I was very early to the airport and then I had all this time to kill, but that's fine with me
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:44.500]   because that's actually time I appreciate because I can write things or, I worked on my book draft on
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:52.580]   the airplane, mostly editing, which it needs a lot because it's really long, it's in word count.
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:56.900]   - So all the things are already completed and you're just editing down or is this things I've
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.380]   written? - No, I wish. It's in five parts
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:05.700]   and I've written one through four and part five is like the chapters are all there, but some of them
[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:12.020]   are messy, some of them are just like a few paragraphs, some of them are just notes, some of
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:19.540]   them are done. So I am kind of almost, it's like five parts and part five is not quite finished,
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:26.260]   but I've been editing along the way. - So this is gonna come out in 2023,
[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:30.580]   I think you mentioned, so it won't come out for a bit or we'll figure it out.
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:36.660]   What have you learned about yourself from putting some of these things down on paper?
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:41.940]   What's like the darkest thing you've realized about yourself from writing?
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:50.020]   - The darkest, well, one of the things that was fascinating is reading through all of our,
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:54.020]   the correspondence between him and me that I was able to find because he deleted all our emails,
[01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:58.020]   but he didn't, I think he thought he deleted all of our G chats, but he didn't.
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:02.740]   - Oh, so he had access to your email, he deleted it on that side too.
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:10.820]   - And he had access to my email most of the time and then at the end was also emailing people as me,
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:17.220]   which was incredibly mortifying to come home and then get back into my old email and find that.
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:22.420]   And I think he was also texting people as me and those I'll never know unless somebody
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:29.300]   brings it to my attention 'cause after a certain date in 2015, he had my phone and he had exclusive
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:36.740]   access to my phone and email. So I wasn't looking at it until I got out, until after we were arrested
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:42.740]   and I was out on bail on my sister's and it took me a long time to get back into my Gmail because
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:48.900]   I had to verify who I am and I never got my phone back. So I don't know what he texted to other
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:59.300]   people as me after that time. But anyway, I was able to recover a lot of our G chats,
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:05.060]   which we used that, I don't know why people don't use it anymore, but it used to be a thing.
[01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:05.540]   - Yeah.
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:09.780]   - It was like, if you work with people and you use Gmail, it's a really easy way to just message
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:10.180]   back and forth.
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:14.580]   - So it's a chat client within Google, but I think Google shut it down already or no?
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:16.100]   - I think it's still there.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:23.700]   - Okay. I used to talk to people on there and nobody talked to me anymore. And so I'd rather be-
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:24.100]   - I've talked to you.
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:33.940]   - Thank you. People don't love Google social products for some reason. The social network,
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:39.380]   they tried several times, Google Plus, it just dies out. Something about it, it's like when
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:46.260]   Microsoft tries to do stuff, it just doesn't feel right. Anyway, it is very lonely in that Google
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:50.420]   chat window. It makes total sense though. Anyway, so that was still there. So you're reading through
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:50.660]   them.
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:56.500]   - So finding, being able to go back and read. And then I kept finding more layers of stuff,
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:03.060]   including a journal that I didn't find, the DA, the prosecutor found.
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:04.580]   - Written by-
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:08.900]   - Me, my journal that I thought he'd thrown away. I didn't know it existed. So
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:18.420]   somehow he still had it and they found my journal, which was for the year 2014
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:20.660]   and the very beginning of 2015.
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:24.580]   - This is after you got, this is in the middle of it.
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:27.780]   - It was in the middle of it. Yeah. So reading that was fascinating.
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:37.380]   - Yeah. What's some interesting things there? Was your mind completely detached?
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:40.580]   - It was weird because no.
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:44.500]   - Were you concerned? Were you in love? Were you afraid?
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:50.740]   - I was not in love. I was afraid. I definitely write repeatedly in there that I'm afraid of him.
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:54.900]   I also write repeatedly things like, I don't know what's going on. Like,
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:59.540]   please let this be over. Please let this be over. Please let this be over. And then in a sort of,
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:04.340]   if I try to remove myself and look at it as if I was a different person,
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:08.420]   it's sort of heartbreaking because I was trying so hard to be positive.
[01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:18.500]   And that didn't work out. I was trying to be positive. So, but when I,
[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:27.620]   it turned up later in the process and my lawyer at the time called or something and said,
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:35.460]   the DA has your, or the prosecutor, they have your journal. I haven't read it yet,
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:40.100]   but as soon as I get a PDF copy, I'll send it to you. So that was sort of weird to think that
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:43.780]   everybody's reading my journal, which, you know, you don't write it thinking people are going to
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.700]   read it unless you're like a historical person. And then later on you think people are going to
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:51.940]   print from it, but you're not, nobody's writing a journal.
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:56.500]   - I can just imagine like a 14 year old thinking they're going to be a historical person.
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:44:01.140]   - Right. Well, no, I mean like, you know, presidents who keep journals and then they're
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:06.340]   later on. So you write it, you don't think anybody's going to read it. And so that was
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:12.020]   a weird feeling. And then also just not knowing, having, you know, not remembering what I wrote.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:20.740]   So I think it was the next day I got, she sent me a PDF copy of it and I read it really quickly
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:25.140]   because I could read my own, it was a PDF. So it was like Xeroxes of the pages. So it was in my
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:29.700]   own handwriting, which I could read really fast. Cause even though it's messy, I wrote it so I
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:34.660]   could read it really fast. And I read the whole thing and was crying because I thought, okay,
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:40.260]   finally, like surely nobody could read this and think that I intended to commit crimes.
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:46.420]   And so I thought like, I thought that journal was just going to fully exonerate me. And they would
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:52.420]   like, you know, if not drop the charges, like it would just be like, okay, well, you know,
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:58.820]   some bad things happened. You're responsible, you know, here's probation, but it didn't seem to make
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:07.860]   any difference, which was strange. But anyway, so the journal, and then also finding all of the
[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:10.820]   correspondence between, not all of the correspondence between him and me, but the,
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:17.860]   the G chat correspondence between him and me, to me, so, you know, all of that in its entirety,
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:23.780]   like I wish that everything could have been kind of put out there as evidence. Like the more they
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:29.700]   turned up the better for me because I wanted them to see everything. And there are just so many
[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:33.780]   examples in the correspondence between him and me where he's, you know, threatening me and,
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:40.420]   you know, lying to me and telling me that if I don't do what he says, my whole life will be
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:44.900]   destroyed and I'll lose everything I ever cared about all kinds of things like that. But what was
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:52.180]   what I still don't quite understand. And what one of my lawyers said why all of that wasn't as useful
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:46:00.820]   as I thought it might be is because so much of that correspondence, I'm like, sarcastically,
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:05.700]   angrily, I'm yelling at him, I'm mad at him. I'm like, fuck you. I'm making fun of him. I call him
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:11.460]   names. I'll say to him, like, you're lying. Why should I believe you? You told me you'd pay me
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:18.980]   back before but you didn't. So it seems like it doesn't, it seems like it doesn't make sense. Like
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:25.620]   how is it that if I say to him, you're lying, you're a liar, that I still, but so then what
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:30.180]   would happen is I'm reading those, that correspondence, and then it stops for a while,
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:35.700]   maybe because I was with him in person. And then I'll look at like my timeline of things and I'll
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:41.780]   see like, oh, I sent him a wire for 80,000. - Yeah, how do you explain your ability to still
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:52.260]   joke around and also to be mean to him in a joking way? Like, you know, couples can do that.
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:58.980]   I guess like, I mean, there's like cruel ways of doing that. And then there's like humorous ways,
[01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:05.460]   just like you're talking shit, whatever. You were able to do that still and yet you're sending over
[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:09.700]   the money and are afraid. Like, how can you be those two things?
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:17.780]   Like as opposed to completely shutting down. - Well, I don't know. I mean, these are all
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:24.740]   interesting questions that I have as well. Like how is it that I was functional and yet also
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:31.300]   doing these things? And so the year that we were gone is like a different level because I no longer
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:37.140]   was running the business. But the thing about dissociation is that you're functioning,
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:42.180]   but like your feelings and your thinking are detached in some way. So that like you're
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:46.580]   functioning and people wouldn't look at you and go, oh, that person's dissociating. 'Cause you're
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:52.580]   functioning, you seem normal, but somehow in your head, you're like disconnecting your feelings
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:59.620]   and your thinking. - So you're still able to be like the game of social interaction,
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:03.460]   like being witty and so on, all that kind of stuff. You're still- - For me, I think it's like
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:08.020]   a coping mechanism too. 'Cause I'll, like if I went, I haven't been to a funeral in a long time,
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:16.820]   but if I went, I'd probably like find absurd thing, or I'll tend to like either make jokes
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:22.180]   or wanna make jokes at really inappropriate times, even in tragic times. 'Cause it's almost like a
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:28.020]   defense mechanism, I think. - Like you said, you told me you like dark humor. Yeah.
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:35.460]   - I, my next door neighbor is Michael Malice. He's an anarchist. - I have one of his books.
[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:37.700]   - "The Hero." - "Dear Reader."
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:44.420]   - "Dear Reader," yeah. And he loves, he embodies dark humor, trolling and dark humor. And is
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:49.780]   underneath it, the sweetest human being. 'Cause he's writing a book now, "The White Pill," that's
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:56.900]   really focused on Stalin and the Hollywood of more, there's basically atrocities throughout
[01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:01.620]   the 20th century. And I think he needs the dark humor to release the valve.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:10.100]   - I think there's something about incredibly good, the most offensive comedians tend to have
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:18.580]   the kindest hearts. I think this is my theory. People like Ricky Gervais, who goes out and
[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:26.660]   insults people and makes jokes that people find horribly offensive and crude. And yet,
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:34.660]   is a huge animal rights guy and appears to be an incredibly sweet and kind person and sensitive.
[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:42.820]   And Howard Stern, people who are incredibly crude, very often are, in my experience,
[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:48.500]   to the extent that I've gotten either to know people personally, observe them,
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:53.140]   learn about them in other ways. But that almost like the more crude and offensive the
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:58.980]   comedian or the person, they tend to have the kindest.
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:02.420]   - Yeah, I don't know if it's a universal rule, but yeah, I see what you mean.
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:06.100]   And you lost me with Howard Stern. He seems like not a good person.
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.380]   - Oh no, he's such a good person.
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:08.100]   - Underneath it?
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:09.620]   - Oh yeah, such a good person.
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:14.260]   - He's just said so much. So I'm friends with Rogan. He says so many ignorant things about
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:15.780]   Rogan, but I suppose that's...
[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:19.700]   - So I haven't heard, I haven't listened to Howard Stern in a long time.
[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:26.820]   And I also think that people who say bad things about Rogan don't listen to his podcast.
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:27.140]   - Right.
[01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:31.380]   - Because if I've listened to his podcast and like people think that,
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:38.180]   I think people would assume that I don't like him because, or the whole like vegan thing and he's
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:43.540]   all about meat and they would think that I would think, no. I mean, because I've listened to enough
[01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:53.780]   of his podcast, I've heard the one where he talked about why he hunts. And whereas if I only knew him
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:59.540]   via his Instagram, I might think he's an asshole. But having listened to all of his, not all,
[01:50:59.540 --> 01:51:03.940]   I don't listen to all of them. There's a ton of them. But having listened to a lot of his podcasts
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:11.940]   enough to know that he's an extremely kind person with all the best intentions. And I think that all
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:16.100]   of that judgment comes from people who are just seeing little clips.
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:16.660]   - Yeah, because the lesson...
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:19.300]   - Because it's probably easy to take little clips from him that sound...
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:23.940]   - Yeah, the lesson there is just not make judgments on people without getting to know
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:28.020]   them, especially, and you have no excuse when the content is out there, like don't be lazy.
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:39.540]   - Yeah, I try. I'm very careful when a lot of these cases, like the Depp herd thing or...
[01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:41.460]   - Oh, Johnny Depp and...
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:47.540]   - And Elizabeth Holmes and anything controversial. And sometimes that makes me,
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:54.180]   I can't think of an example, but very often, when somebody criticizes something or something
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:58.420]   becomes controversial, that's what gets me to want to understand it better. So then I'll go
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:00.020]   read the book that everybody's mad about.
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:05.620]   - Yeah, it's hard to know what's true though. So I try to have humility and always assume I don't
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:10.580]   really know the full story and keep pulling at the string, keep learning more and more. But even then,
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:16.500]   like the more you learn, the more you realize the things are complex. What do you think about
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:23.460]   as a small tangent, Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, trial's going on, it's a quick pause, it's going
[01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:25.460]   to resume next week.
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:30.580]   - So again, this is one of those situations where, you know, I have very limited information
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:32.660]   because I'm also not sitting there watching the trial.
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:34.100]   - Yeah, have you watched any of it?
[01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:39.620]   - Little bits of it. And it's like, I know that if I go there, I'm going to want to watch it all.
[01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:40.820]   - Yeah, it's good.
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:41.540]   - I know.
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:49.060]   - Because it's raw human relationships that is most toxic at its most deep also,
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:53.380]   because you can tell there's love, probably still there's love, which is the interesting thing.
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:56.020]   They probably still love each other, even though they hate each other.
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:04.340]   And like, there's a lot of lying going on. It looks like it's Amber Heard lying to my foolish
[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:11.860]   eyes. It seems like she's lying nonstop, but you know, I want to know the full story and we'll
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:18.100]   never get to know it. But you see this raw, like post-mortem on a relationship, on a love affair
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:23.140]   that was clearly passionate. There was clearly something deep of a connection there. And it just,
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:27.780]   that's the sad thing about love. It can destroy you as much as it can uplift you.
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:31.140]   - It can be also used to destroy people.
[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:33.700]   - Yeah, to manipulate and all that kind of stuff, yeah.
[01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:42.420]   - Right. So people who feel that strongly are, I think, particularly vulnerable. Yeah, it's
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:52.420]   hard to talk about because I've dipped into like a podcast or something where other people were
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:58.180]   discussing "Bad Vegan" in like a pop culture way and they're analyzing it and it's so annoying to
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:01.300]   listen to. 'Cause I'm like, "Oh my God, that's totally wrong. That's totally wrong. Well,
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:06.020]   if they only knew this, will I have... Nope, that's wrong." So, you know, listening to other
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:13.140]   people analyzing my situation or my psychology when they don't have all the information has
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:17.300]   been really frustrating. But I did... - There's a difference. There's a difference
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:21.780]   'cause the world doesn't know much about you except for the Netflix documentary.
[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:24.020]   - Right. - There's a lot more information
[01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:29.060]   about both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard and the trial is revealing the real people. This is so
[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:30.500]   interesting. - But I haven't watched it all.
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:35.700]   - Okay. But there's a difference between a documentary and like a raw human being.
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:38.340]   - Exactly, the real trial. - Sitting there. You can see the body
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:44.020]   language. And it's so interesting that I think you could tell the difference between a person
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:48.180]   who is full of shit and not... - No.
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:52.580]   - I'm not sure. - It's another... I can't remember.
[01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:58.580]   - Sorry, I keep interrupting you, but on top of this, they're actors too, which is very annoying.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:01.860]   - Right, exactly. - 'Cause I don't know if they're putting...
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:08.420]   But sure as hell looks like Amber Heard is putting on a soap opera act. Soap opera meaning
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:14.020]   really bad acting and lies. - I would say all of these things are really
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:19.860]   hard. People would say about me, "I don't look like a victim." And I don't mind you interrupting
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:24.500]   me because Andrew Huberman said that means you're interested in the conversation. He said it was a
[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:31.620]   good thing. So you don't have to apologize for interrupting me. He keeps coming up, but I keep
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:34.420]   thinking of these. - That's one of the things that Andrew told
[01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:38.980]   me that I'm like, "Are you sure? 'Cause it just does seem like an asshole thing to do."
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:43.860]   - I guess it depends on the context. If we were in a business meeting and somebody talks
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:48.340]   over you to kind of make their point heard, but if it's a one-on-one situation, then it's not.
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:52.420]   - I could argue that forever. - Anyway, so a long time ago,
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:59.220]   I listened to, there was an audio that was released of a taped argument between Johnny
[01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:05.060]   Depp and Amber Heard. And I don't remember why, which one of them had taped it and if they knew
[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:09.140]   it was being taped, but it was like an hour and a half. And I listened to it almost like you would
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:12.420]   listen to a podcast where I was doing other things. It was like cleaning my apartment and I was
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:14.660]   fascinated listening to it. - To a fight.
[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:19.940]   - And it's interesting too, 'cause it was just the audio, so you're not looking at their body
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:24.900]   language, which can be completely misleading. And there was another podcast where they talked
[01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:32.420]   about how judges make worse decisions on whether or not somebody deserves parole or to be released
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:38.260]   on bail when they see the person in person versus if they're just looking at the information on
[01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:45.780]   paper. So I think body language and those kinds of things can actually be misleading. Or we think
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:50.740]   that by looking somebody in the eye, we'll know if they're lying or not, but the skilled liars
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:58.580]   are able to bypass that. Because I'm jumping all over the place, but one of the things about
[01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:03.780]   sociopaths is they're not gonna have the same tell. So if I was lying, somebody would know
[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:09.620]   because I'm stressed out, mortified, I'm probably doing all the things that we do when we lie,
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:16.420]   'cause it's stressful for me, whereas they don't have those things. So I think that they could,
[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:21.220]   for example, I think that they could pass a lie detector test. They also don't have a startle
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:28.900]   response. So the activity in their brain, like if you and I watched something graphic and tragic
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:33.460]   on TV or watched something happen, things would happen in our brains that don't happen in the
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:37.860]   brains of sociopaths. So they don't react to things in the same way that we do.
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:42.900]   - Again, you keep assuming I'm not a sociopath. I didn't say I'm not a sociopath. This assumption
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:47.620]   you keep making is very interesting. Then why did I murder all those people? Let's get back to the,
[01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:49.780]   what were we talking about?
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:55.540]   - Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. So the audio that I heard made me, without knowing anything else,
[01:57:55.540 --> 01:58:03.620]   made me very inclined to be team Johnny Depp. Just based on that audio.
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:07.780]   - Yeah. Well, that's how the people are feeling about this whole interaction. By the way,
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:11.940]   I do think it's a very healthy thing to do in a relationship is to record each other for months
[01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:18.340]   at a time. Every time you fight, that just seems like a very, that's sarcasm. I don't understand
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:25.220]   how that, because they both recorded each other. I suppose you could look back at all human
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:30.740]   relations and be like, this was ridiculous. What was I doing? But when you're in it, you don't.
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:35.300]   - Right. I wondered that too. Like who made the recording and why? And
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:40.580]   did they both know about it, that it was being recorded?
[01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:47.540]   - Sometimes they did, sometimes they didn't. All I know is just the poetry of Johnny Depp's
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:56.820]   speaking and sort of movement about the whole thing. It's interesting. It makes you wonder
[01:58:56.820 --> 01:59:03.620]   what's real. Maybe this is whole, maybe they're both in love and this is like a troll that they
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:12.020]   played on the world. I don't know. It makes me wonder what's real at all. Because you have to
[01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:15.700]   remember they're actors too. - Yeah. I don't think he would have
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:18.500]   filed the lawsuit if he was- - No, I'm joking.
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:26.340]   - No, I know. But no, I mean, my point is if somebody was trying to make the argument that
[01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:32.260]   he's the abuser and that he's lying and he's full of shit, it sort of doesn't make sense that he
[01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:41.460]   would have filed a lawsuit unless he's trying to have this all come out in the open because
[01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:44.660]   he believes he's in the right. Again, I have no idea.
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:50.100]   - I agree with you. I agree with you. As a fan of love and human nature, I appreciate the fact
[01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:56.100]   that they went through this. I know it's probably extremely painful, but it's fascinating to watch
[01:59:56.100 --> 02:00:02.820]   human relationships be presented in such a raw way. It made me realize how rare it is to get
[02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:06.180]   a glimpse like that. - Yeah. And I think one of the reasons I
[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:13.220]   like that book, "Confessions of a Sociopath" also is it's female who's writing it. And I think
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:19.460]   statistically men are more likely to be sociopaths, maybe not. I mean, these are all
[02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:28.340]   things where a lot of times there exist statistics that would be inherently hard to get.
[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:35.220]   So who knows? But I think that people tend to think of sociopaths more as men,
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:42.260]   which probably gives female sociopaths the advantage in that people are less likely to
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:49.460]   - like the Elizabeth Holmes, people who are really manipulative and really good at it.
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:56.820]   And part of how they're able to succeed is that people don't understand their motives,
[02:00:56.820 --> 02:01:01.780]   or people will assume that people behave rationally, even if rationally means,
[02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:08.980]   it's like Anthony Strange's. It would have made more sense if he had gotten all this money out of
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:15.380]   me and put it in an overseas account and then ditched me and got on a plane to Mexico. Everybody
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:23.700]   would understand that more. Whereas the way things happened and he dragged me around the country and
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:29.220]   like, "What were we doing in Tennessee?" And then why didn't... Nothing really makes any sense.
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:37.140]   And also all of the things that he did to me and had me do, it was as if
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:46.500]   all of those things together only make sense if his primary goal was to maximally destroy me
[02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:51.060]   and also make it like, have me burn all my bridges and make it so I'll never recover.
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:57.940]   And when you read a book like that, you understand that that's what he wanted. That's his life.
[02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:00.340]   So can you explain that further?
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:01.060]   It's like a game.
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:01.860]   What do you think...
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:03.620]   It's about power and it's a game.
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:08.820]   Do you think he understood the long-term goals he has, or was it the short-term game of it that
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:10.980]   he enjoyed, the ability to destroy you?
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:13.460]   Well, yeah, it was the short-term game of it.
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:14.740]   Because it's controlling another human?
[02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:23.300]   Yeah. And also I think for him, the motivations are just different. So
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:29.220]   he spent a year incarcerated because he never got out on bail, but then he got out...
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:32.500]   He's out of prison now.
[02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:38.420]   He got out before I went in to serve my time, which was particularly...
[02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:46.180]   Psychologically, I had to try really hard not to be infuriated.
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:54.980]   But anyway, so I think for him, the consequence of spending time in jail is sort of like an
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:03:03.700]   inconvenience. It's like life is a game. And so he wouldn't feel... If you're not capable of being
[02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:12.740]   emotionally hurt, then you have immense power because you can go around and do things and
[02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:14.980]   people can't hurt you. It's like a superpower.
[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:18.820]   And he did this for people who are not familiar. I guess he did this to other women.
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:23.540]   Yes. Yes.
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:31.380]   I think it was in the documentary that his ex-wife from somewhere else was...
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:32.180]   Florida.
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:32.980]   Florida.
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:36.020]   Of course, Florida. Sorry.
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:39.140]   Strong words.
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:42.660]   It's just like when there's the weirdest story about people eating
[02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:49.060]   Tide pods and then doing crazy... It's always in Florida. So I feel like whenever crazy things...
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:53.140]   So to me, it makes sense that he would have spent time in Florida before and that's where...
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:54.020]   Crazy in a good way.
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:58.500]   And I mean that on an insult on him. I also... She's an amazing person.
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:03:59.300]   Yes. Yes.
[02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:05.060]   So it's him that I'm making the Florida is weird.
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:09.780]   Yes. He manipulated her as well, lied to her, that kind of things.
[02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:15.940]   Well, jumping around, but one of the things you said that was disturbingly misleading is
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:24.500]   the ending of the documentary. And the ending has a phone call, I think, of you and Anthony talking.
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:32.260]   So high level, let me ask. How many times have you talked with Anthony since you got
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:40.180]   out of prison and what did you talk about? And why is that, quote, misleading? That segment of
[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:41.700]   audio misleading?
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:44.980]   My issue with it also was that it was deliberately misleading, which was
[02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:55.220]   what was particularly infuriating about it. And then also there was... It was like there were
[02:04:55.220 --> 02:05:02.260]   one major thing that was incorrect that I think helped allow people to make an incorrect conclusion
[02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:09.300]   at the end was in the film, it talks about... I say something about how my accountant made a joke
[02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:15.300]   about if I married him, he could easily transfer me money without tax consequences. And then the
[02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:21.860]   film has me saying something like, and then within 24 hours we were married, but that's like audio
[02:05:21.860 --> 02:05:24.340]   from here and audio from here spliced together.
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:26.420]   So they made it seem like there's a...
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:30.500]   Like I married him because it was like he could give me money and that wasn't the case.
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:34.660]   So you're part mastermind of some kind of scheme that involve
[02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:37.620]   money transfer and you got married and that kind of stuff.
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:43.460]   Right. Or if nothing else, I was trying to get money, that's why I married him. Which is absurd
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:48.500]   because again, New York is full of legitimate people with loads of money. If I really wanted
[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:54.260]   to marry somebody for money in New York, it wouldn't be that hard to do. But anyway, it was
[02:05:54.260 --> 02:06:02.020]   just a deliberate making it seem like my intention was to marry him for his fictitious money.
[02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:04.900]   Okay. So that's one.
[02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:05.860]   And either way...
[02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:12.580]   Let's go to that ending thing because we're on that sort of topic. When you got out of prison,
[02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:22.740]   what the film implies is that whatever, there's a small aspect of your mind that still wants to
[02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:25.620]   continue a relationship with Anthony.
[02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:26.980]   Yeah. That's not the case.
[02:06:26.980 --> 02:06:33.460]   And not just that, but there's still flirtation and that kind of body incline.
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:34.660]   Mm-hmm (affirmative)
[02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:43.540]   Like we got the world at our fingertips, we're playing. So I mean, one of the exciting things
[02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:50.500]   about being a couple that's fucking with the world, that's getting away with something is that
[02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:59.220]   there's all these powerful forces that want to catch you in a crime and you keep getting away
[02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:00.900]   with it. That's exciting.
[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:03.220]   And some romance.
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:05.140]   In a romantic world, it could be, although...
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:06.500]   Yeah. Not in this case.
[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:11.460]   Right. And also, I always have to keep reminding people, "Get away with what?"
[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:18.100]   Because I lost everything and all these people lost other... People I cared about lost a lot.
[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:22.900]   My mother lost a lot, but I lost everything too.
[02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:26.100]   Yeah. Your restaurant, your dream.
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:35.220]   Yeah. My reputation, my stuff, my home, ending up with millions of dollars of debt. It's not even
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:40.340]   like I lost it all and then it's a clean slate. It's like I lost it all and now I have this giant
[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:50.260]   boulder of... Or this wobbly, unclear how to... Yeah. So when people say...
[02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:52.340]   Well, Sisyphus kind of thing.
[02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:55.140]   "Got away with something," I'm always like, "Got away with what?"
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:07:55.700]   I know.
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:08:00.980]   Destroying my life and ending up in debt. Because that's... It's not even like... You can't even
[02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:06.900]   sort of point to as if I was trying to do something and then, oops, that happened. It's like, there's
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:17.860]   nothing that logically makes sense if somebody was trying to decipher my... Whatever motives I
[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:18.900]   might have had.
[02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:23.940]   Yeah. You didn't walk away from the explosion. You were inside the explosion. Okay.
[02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:31.620]   But that said, the movie implied... And so, it's interesting to ask, not just
[02:08:31.620 --> 02:08:40.180]   in clarifying the movie, but just as a human being, you're out of prison, he's out of prison.
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:51.380]   There was that toxic connection, but it was there. And there's a depth to it. So toxic
[02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:58.100]   connections can be pretty deep. So what was the conversation like and how often have you
[02:08:58.100 --> 02:08:58.740]   talked with him?
[02:08:58.740 --> 02:09:04.740]   Well, we don't speak anymore. And that call at the end was...
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:05.620]   Not even on G-chat?
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:14.580]   Was recorded on... I recorded the call and gave it to them. So I was deliberately recording him.
[02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:18.180]   It's not like I was caught on a hot mic. I made that call.
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:18.900]   As part of the documentary.
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:23.620]   I recorded him intentionally. I was trying to get him to repeat some of the kookier things he would
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:31.780]   say about his meat suit or some of the weird... The things about something not being real.
[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:35.780]   The more fantastical things. I was trying to get him to repeat those things.
[02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:40.900]   And it was probably a 40-minute call, which it's actually on my phone. I still have it.
[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:42.260]   I haven't gone back to listen to it.
[02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:44.340]   You ever think of publishing that whole thing?
[02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:47.380]   Oh, yeah. Oh, I think about publishing everything. My entire journal.
[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:52.180]   You should publish that call unedited. Just publish it. That'd be fun.
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:58.660]   No, I want to publish a lot of stuff. He took all these videos of me also that they used a couple
[02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:03.700]   of clips of. And I would... They're also on my phone. I would publish them all. I would publish
[02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:05.860]   everything. In particular...
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:08.980]   Because you'll release that with your book. It's good.
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:15.540]   Yeah. I probably... I've planned to do that eventually. If all of that material would be
[02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:23.300]   really useful to psychologists or people studying it. So, to the extent that it would help other
[02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:26.260]   people understand what happened, which I think would be meaningful.
[02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:28.180]   Well, he's still out there. He's fascinating.
[02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:34.820]   Yeah. He's still out there doing weird shit with his clean slate. I get a little annoyed about that.
[02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:36.980]   He's got the clean slate.
[02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:43.700]   Well, he didn't have a restaurant. He didn't have a persona. Does he have any public persona or no?
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:44.900]   Or we don't know?
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:49.060]   He got booted off of Twitter. Elon will put him back on.
[02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:52.020]   Is that a passive-aggressive statement?
[02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:56.020]   No, not at all. I find that whole conversation really, really interesting.
[02:10:56.020 --> 02:11:00.260]   Whether to put somebody like Anthony back on Twitter.
[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:05.380]   Well, no. I think... Because I used to always think if only everybody had to identify as
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:10.900]   themselves on Twitter. And you could have a parody account. Or like Leon has an account,
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:16.660]   but it's very clear that it's me behind it. Or sometimes there's like Devin Nunez's cow.
[02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:23.860]   So, people have parody accounts. But if we could identify who it is, then a lot of...
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:25.460]   Why did he get booted off of Twitter?
[02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:30.980]   I don't know. But I used to... So, in the last few years, I would periodically,
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:37.380]   probably like once a month, maybe more, I would look at his Twitter just to kind of see where
[02:11:37.380 --> 02:11:46.340]   is he and just to see what is he up to. And I figured out, I could tell from the photographs
[02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:51.300]   that he'd moved to California. And I think he might have told me one of the last times I spoke
[02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:59.300]   to him that he was going to move to California. And then I also screen grabbed a lot of stuff
[02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:03.540]   that he put on Twitter. And he put these creepy videos of himself on Twitter at the beginning of
[02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:05.060]   COVID. I screen grabbed those.
[02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:07.300]   Just...
[02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:12.340]   And then one day I went and like he was, you know, account was suspended. And then I kept
[02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:16.820]   going back and it's like been suspended ever since. So, he might have started a new account.
[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:19.860]   And I don't know what it is. Probably...
[02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:21.380]   He's probably in California, you're saying.
[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:27.140]   He is in California. That's been verified. Somebody who was going to have to interact
[02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:34.260]   with him in an official capacity was going to go meet him. And I said, and was nervous about it.
[02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:40.340]   And I said, he's going to be really likable. Like you're going to like him. He's probably
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:46.500]   going to like figure out what you're interested in, talk sports, talk whatever it is that he
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:49.620]   figures out quickly that you're interested in. He's going to be really nice. He's going to seem
[02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:54.420]   like a nice guy. And that person later got back to me and was like, you're exactly right.
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:58.740]   So, yeah, that's the sociopath thing, right?
[02:12:58.740 --> 02:12:59.700]   Yeah.
[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:02.740]   Extremely careful. But inside relationship, that's even more dangerous.
[02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:10.980]   So, I think that part of the reason I spoke to him was entirely self-serving and strategic
[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:16.260]   after the fact. Well, even before I knew there was ever going to be a documentary,
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:24.660]   I spoke to him. And I knew how dangerous it was because I knew that in a situation like this,
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:28.580]   you're supposed to have no contact, which makes sense. And I understand why,
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:33.380]   which makes it extra tragic when people have kids with a sociopath or in a narcissistic,
[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:37.700]   abusive relationship. If you have kids, then you're tethered, which is tragic.
[02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:42.500]   But why are you supposed to avoid conversations? Because you can get pulled right back.
[02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:49.620]   You still have no contact. Yeah. Because they'll continue abuse or you'll be vulnerable to them
[02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:53.380]   being able to pull you back in. So, I knew that to be the case.
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:58.980]   But why was it self-serving? Why did you talk to him anyway?
[02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:08.340]   Because he was going to be out free out in the open while I was going to be locked up
[02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:16.340]   at Rikers for three and a half months. And the one thing that, if his motivation was to destroy me,
[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:23.220]   then what else could he do to really hammer that last nail in the coffin?
[02:14:25.220 --> 02:14:30.740]   That would be Leon. And so, he would have known that Leon would be staying with my mother.
[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:34.900]   You know, he knows where he spent a lot of time at our house. He knows where she lives.
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:40.740]   It would be super easy for him to just drive up there, you know, wait for her to let him out.
[02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:47.860]   And then, you know, he because out in the country, he can be off leash. And all he'd have to do is
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:53.940]   kind of whistle, call him over, and he could take him away and do whatever. So, I was completely
[02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:56.500]   gripped with that fear.
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:59.460]   So, not fear for yourself, but fear for Leon.
[02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:05.940]   Well, I was going to be at least safe from him, but I was going to be locked away.
[02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:11.300]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Rikers. Yeah, yeah, sure. I got it. Got it, got it, got it.
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:16.980]   I would be powerless to do anything. And he would have free reign to go
[02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:23.300]   and destroy me further by, you know, taking or hurting Leon.
[02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:32.660]   And then, when he got out, I still had unfollowed him from my own account, but
[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:40.580]   Leon had never unfollowed him. So, I was looking at his account.
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:47.860]   Can I just say, because Joe has an account for his dog, too. I just love when people do that.
[02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:52.980]   It's so great. Because I actually pretend, in my mind, for some reason, I do think Leon has
[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:58.180]   an account. Like, I don't, you forget that there's a human behind it. You're like, oh, okay, cool.
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:15:59.460]   Yeah, I know.
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:04.580]   I love it when people do that. Anyway, so, continue. So, Leon didn't unfollow him, and what?
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:10.500]   So, I was able to go back and look at his Twitter, and he,
[02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:16.340]   that's not how he quickly got a phone, but he very quickly started tweeting right after he got out.
[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:23.700]   And I was kind of fascinated, because I didn't know what to expect or what he was going to be
[02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:30.260]   saying. And then he started saying things that I could tell were directed at me, you know,
[02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:35.780]   like little things that only I would know, you know, like random things, like things that were
[02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:41.300]   like the equivalent of an inside joke that you have. So, he was posting things like that.
[02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:50.660]   And there's so many things going on at once. So, another thing that would have, in a twisted,
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:57.780]   but I think understandable way, in sort of a sick way that I was fully aware of,
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:04.500]   is that here I am having gone through this completely, like, messed up thing that now
[02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:10.180]   I'm in trouble for, everybody's looking at, and nobody understands, right? And so, there was this
[02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:18.340]   unfortunate situation of the only person who understands what I went through is the person
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:25.380]   who put me through it. Right? So... So, were you also just a little bit seeking closure of some
[02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:31.060]   kind? Probably a lot, but also with the awareness that I probably wasn't going to get it, you know?
[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:36.580]   And I mean, I know for a fact I would never get it in the same way that, which is why,
[02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:44.580]   which is why I was able to later on, like in the context of recording those calls,
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:53.540]   I was able to talk to him in this detached way, because I know he doesn't give a shit that,
[02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:59.380]   like, he doesn't give any shits about what he did to my mother, or me, or anybody, or anything,
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:05.300]   just doesn't care. So, he's certainly not going to care if I, you know, he's never going to say,
[02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:12.500]   like, "I'm sorry," or "I did a bad thing," or, or like, he's not going to be affected. Like,
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:16.820]   if I yelled and screamed at him, that would just be frustrating for me, and he would actually
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:22.900]   probably be gratified by that. So... So, that gave you, that empowered you in being
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:31.220]   cold and sort of distant? Yes, and I had a prior experience where I had to do the same thing,
[02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:39.540]   where like, if you're, if you're able to be very cold and not allow somebody to push your buttons,
[02:18:39.540 --> 02:18:44.740]   then you're taking away their power, and then that feels empowering, or it feels like we're
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:50.660]   claiming a little bit of your power. So, in my talking to him, I always had a reason,
[02:18:50.660 --> 02:18:55.780]   you know, like, there was always, like, I didn't want him to hurt Leon, or I wanted information,
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:19:01.540]   or I wanted to know where he was. I'd rather let him think that, you know, maybe he could still
[02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:07.940]   manipulate me one day, or whatever. It was, like, safer to keep that there than to not know where
[02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:13.060]   he was, and if I was going to, like, be walking Leon and turn the corner, and he's standing there,
[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:18.900]   and, you know, like, it, like, if there's a crazy murderer out on the loose, you'd rather know where
[02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:25.620]   they are than have no idea. So, there are a lot of different reasons. Why does it upset you
[02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:31.140]   why was it wrong to have that audio clip at the end of the documentary? Like, what did it...
[02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:35.700]   Well, because it implied all kinds of things that were completely not true, and it also just didn't
[02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:41.860]   make sense, and it confused people, and so... So, for people who haven't watched it, spoiler
[02:19:41.860 --> 02:19:48.740]   alert, is they play the clip of... Sorry, I don't even remember what was said, but it was kind of...
[02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:53.300]   That last... What we spoke about? Yeah, what was the...
[02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:59.380]   I know. I only watched... Like, I still haven't watched it. I only watched the film once while,
[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:05.460]   you know, people were looking at me for my reaction, and I was crying, and it was really
[02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:09.540]   weird and strange and surreal, and I haven't gone back to watch it again. I feel like I'm just going
[02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:18.820]   to get more annoyed, but I will eventually, but... And when the ending happened, I immediately
[02:20:18.820 --> 02:20:22.820]   blurted out, like, "I hate that. I hate that ending," but I sort of assumed...
[02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:27.220]   A lot of people saw it for what it was. They saw that it was, like,
[02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:32.020]   the director doing a weird thing, and that it was kind of just weird and off, and, like,
[02:20:32.020 --> 02:20:35.780]   that doesn't make sense. Yeah, it seemed out of the blue, but so it was basically you joking
[02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:40.660]   around, like, flirting, almost. It made it seem like, as if we're still friendly.
[02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:47.940]   And there's more to come. It's almost like there's going to be a Bad Vegan 2.
[02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:55.700]   Right. Yeah, and then also, I mean, it made it seem like, you know, if I was laughing with him,
[02:20:55.700 --> 02:21:01.460]   that I don't take anything seriously, you know, that I don't take what happened seriously, or...
[02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:08.260]   Yeah, or don't feel any remorse, which is why the... Yeah, and after that, he goes to the
[02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:14.340]   credits with "Wild World," which is a great song. "Oh, baby, it's a wild world."
[02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:19.620]   I never got to hear that, because the version I watched didn't have the end credits, but
[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:25.700]   I knew that they used that song at the end, and paid a lot for it.
[02:21:25.700 --> 02:21:32.180]   Yeah, yeah, I was like, "Oh, well, you got this song." Did you ever say what was the darkest thing
[02:21:32.180 --> 02:21:35.780]   about yourself that you discover from the book?
[02:21:35.780 --> 02:21:38.420]   Oh. No.
[02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:39.380]   We took attention upon attention upon attention.
[02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:43.380]   Right, because we started talking about, exactly, yeah, about the G-chats, and I think
[02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:52.020]   it was, I guess it was trying to understand how I was able to be sarcastic and make jokes
[02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:56.980]   at his expense while all that stuff was going on.
[02:21:56.980 --> 02:22:04.340]   Ah, so what is that? Have you figured out what that means about you?
[02:22:05.940 --> 02:22:12.180]   No. No, it just was interesting to look at, and also, I think,
[02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:23.540]   I have a tendency sometimes to be sort of jokingly hyperbolic or sarcastic,
[02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:35.220]   and it's gotten me into trouble. One time, I got locked up in the Harlem psych ward for a day,
[02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:42.500]   because of my hyperbole and sarcasm, and like this sort of lost in translation errors.
[02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:46.980]   That's a heck of a lost in translation error.
[02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:47.480]   Yeah.
[02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:51.220]   Did you say something funny to a therapist?
[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:58.180]   Yeah, I mean, I was sort of making jokes about how bad I was feeling, but in a hyperbolic way,
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:03.140]   and so then suddenly, somebody told somebody, and then the lost in translation,
[02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:07.140]   and then they were worried that I might kill myself, and then did a wellness check,
[02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:09.860]   and then tried to call me, and I was in the shower, so I didn't answer the phone.
[02:23:09.860 --> 02:23:14.020]   So then somebody called the police to do a wellness check on me.
[02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:16.740]   Things just escalated.
[02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:23.780]   And then not knowing that if I had handled it the right, if I had immediately,
[02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:29.540]   if I'd sort of understood what was going on and handled it the right way immediately, I
[02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:33.540]   probably could have gotten out of it, but they err on the side of taking you to the hospital,
[02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:34.020]   no matter what.
[02:23:34.020 --> 02:23:34.740]   Makes a lot of sense.
[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:36.740]   And I didn't know that. And it also...
[02:23:36.740 --> 02:23:40.180]   So you really leaned into the joke by going to the hospital?
[02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:46.420]   I didn't. It's sort of one of those situations that was both comical and tragic, because
[02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:49.300]   and would actually make a really good...
[02:23:49.300 --> 02:23:56.980]   It's weird how I do this sometimes. Like, it would make a really good scene in a filmed version.
[02:23:56.980 --> 02:23:58.340]   Who would play you in the film?
[02:23:58.900 --> 02:24:02.260]   Uh, I don't know. There is a thing being made that's...
[02:24:02.260 --> 02:24:02.980]   Sharon Stone?
[02:24:02.980 --> 02:24:03.380]   ...that's very interesting, because...
[02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:04.260]   Who would play?
[02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:05.220]   Because...
[02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:07.300]   Have you cast the scene yet?
[02:24:07.300 --> 02:24:14.180]   No, but there's a thing being made that I have nothing to do with, which is frustrating and weird.
[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:15.060]   What film, about you?
[02:24:15.060 --> 02:24:20.740]   Like somebody's making a fictionalized drama, and it's frustrating because,
[02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:25.220]   for all kinds of obvious reasons, it's like annoying and...
[02:24:25.220 --> 02:24:26.500]   It can go any way.
[02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:27.460]   It could go any way.
[02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:28.820]   You could be like the bad guy.
[02:24:28.820 --> 02:24:31.860]   Inevitably, they'll get a bajillion things wrong.
[02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:36.500]   And there are also a bunch of people profiting off of it, and like, "Thanks, guys."
[02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:41.460]   So it's infuriating for all kinds of reasons.
[02:24:41.460 --> 02:24:44.020]   Do you know who's playing? Who are the actors?
[02:24:44.020 --> 02:24:49.060]   No, I don't even... I just don't. I'll inevitably know, but I don't really want to know.
[02:24:49.060 --> 02:24:52.420]   The whole thing is just annoying. And also, I've always...
[02:24:52.420 --> 02:24:54.340]   People ask me this all the time, and I always thought,
[02:24:56.180 --> 02:25:00.980]   because of the way everything that happened was such a kind of a slow build,
[02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:05.540]   and there was so much nuance, and it's kind of really hard to understand that
[02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:12.020]   it could only really be done well in like a Breaking Bad type of series, long, like a long
[02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:19.780]   series, where like you would be taken through these kind of gut-wrenching, icky, slow build
[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:22.820]   things, and then that would make it all make sense.
[02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:26.020]   If it was done that way, it could be done accurately.
[02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:28.820]   But the reason why I think...
[02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:34.740]   So I made these stupid jokes, and then somebody did a wellness check, and...
[02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:38.500]   Or asked the police to do a wellness...
[02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:39.140]   Have you ever...
[02:25:39.140 --> 02:25:42.980]   When they knocked on my door and came in, it was like a repeat of getting arrested,
[02:25:42.980 --> 02:25:46.820]   so I sort of weirdly flashed back to that, and then burst into tears,
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:52.420]   which isn't the appropriate response if you're trying to diffuse a...
[02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:57.380]   If you're trying to discourage the people coming to do the wellness check from taking you to the
[02:25:57.380 --> 02:26:02.340]   hospital, starting to cry is not the right reaction.
[02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:06.740]   Well, the thing is, I mean, there is...
[02:26:06.740 --> 02:26:10.180]   It's funny, but it could be also through the joke.
[02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:18.580]   The joke, the best jokes are grounded in truth and pain, in this case, pain.
[02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:19.140]   Yeah.
[02:26:19.140 --> 02:26:21.860]   Right, so there...
[02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:22.740]   And truth.
[02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:29.220]   Have you ever, if I may ask, considered suicide?
[02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:30.260]   Yes.
[02:26:30.260 --> 02:26:35.320]   When?
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:41.860]   Well, I'm kind of a wimp, so I'm afraid of all of the gruesome ways, but...
[02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:53.780]   One of the things I remember doing is sort of hoarding medications, which I had when...
[02:26:53.780 --> 02:27:03.700]   Around the time and before he took me away, because I wanted the safety of an out.
[02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:09.700]   But around that time, so when Anthony went...
[02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:12.980]   That's the road trip right before the road trip from hell, you were hoarding...
[02:27:12.980 --> 02:27:14.100]   Around that time, yeah.
[02:27:14.100 --> 02:27:15.220]   Hoarding medication and...
[02:27:15.220 --> 02:27:21.700]   Like I, yeah, like if I could get my hands on any sort of weird medication, I would kind of hold on to it.
[02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:25.140]   And...
[02:27:25.140 --> 02:27:26.260]   To all the chaos that you go through.
[02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:28.980]   But I think I knew that it would be hard to do it that way.
[02:27:28.980 --> 02:27:32.420]   So I definitely thought about it, but I never...
[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:43.540]   In that really tough time, you know, you're thinking about taking your own life,
[02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:45.540]   what gave you hope?
[02:27:45.540 --> 02:27:48.820]   What gave you sort of...
[02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:55.140]   Because the business, the restaurant that you give so much of yourself to is lost.
[02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:57.460]   You're lying to everybody.
[02:27:57.460 --> 02:28:01.140]   You're in the hole financially.
[02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:06.500]   You're being psychologically trapped, manipulated.
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:09.300]   I might just go kill myself now.
[02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:11.540]   Well, you're still there.
[02:28:11.940 --> 02:28:13.940]   (laughing)
[02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:14.580]   Please don't.
[02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:16.020]   See, I made a joke about it, like that's...
[02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:16.580]   There you go.
[02:28:16.580 --> 02:28:19.540]   But it's always there.
[02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:20.840]   It's the...
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:31.060]   Albert Camus, you know, says, you basically always have to be aggressively looking for a reason to live.
[02:28:31.060 --> 02:28:32.280]   Otherwise...
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:34.820]   What's the point?
[02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:37.940]   Yeah, otherwise it's easy to go the other way.
[02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:40.500]   Because why live is a very good question.
[02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:46.260]   But anyways, by way of hope, by way, you know, it's a dark time.
[02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:48.580]   It's a dark time.
[02:28:48.580 --> 02:28:54.180]   If you could sort of look back, what gave you just strength?
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:29:02.980]   I think that just, you know, just having like a sort of relentless optimism.
[02:29:04.660 --> 02:29:12.100]   And I think too that sometimes people assume that suicide is the result of circumstances,
[02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:14.500]   which maybe in some cases it is.
[02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:18.660]   But I think one of the things that that book explains well is that very often it doesn't
[02:29:18.660 --> 02:29:20.020]   have anything to do with circumstances.
[02:29:20.020 --> 02:29:22.100]   It's just the pain.
[02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:23.160]   Which book?
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:24.980]   The Darkness Visible.
[02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:27.460]   You know, because people like to...
[02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:32.820]   So when somebody commits suicide, people will very often criticize them like it was a selfish
[02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:37.060]   act if they have a family, which most people do, but especially if they have kids.
[02:29:37.060 --> 02:29:43.540]   And I think that, yeah, everybody's quick to sort of call the person who killed themselves
[02:29:43.540 --> 02:29:44.340]   selfish.
[02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:52.580]   And I think that the type of pain that one is experiencing that leads to that is something
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:55.460]   that most people, and I don't, like people don't understand.
[02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:57.780]   But it's not a selfish thing.
[02:29:57.780 --> 02:30:01.940]   It's just like quite literally becomes intolerable from what I understand.
[02:30:02.580 --> 02:30:03.940]   And it can hit you.
[02:30:03.940 --> 02:30:04.740]   It could be slow.
[02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:05.540]   It could be fast.
[02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:07.460]   Yes.
[02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:08.020]   That pain.
[02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:09.380]   Yes.
[02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:16.900]   So I think because for me it was more just my circumstances were so crappy.
[02:30:16.900 --> 02:30:23.940]   But also I had an awareness that, you know, even in Rikers I knew how wildly lucky I was
[02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:30.820]   to have, you know, family, a support system, you know, opportunities.
[02:30:30.820 --> 02:30:34.420]   And like I'll always be okay one way or another.
[02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:43.460]   So I felt lucky that I have that.
[02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:50.660]   But, you know, also I want, you know, the shame of everything that happened and, you
[02:30:50.660 --> 02:30:55.620]   know, will I ever be able to crawl out from under it and rebuild something?
[02:30:55.620 --> 02:30:56.100]   I don't know.
[02:30:57.540 --> 02:31:02.420]   So there were certainly times where, especially when I would learn something new, like reading
[02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:06.260]   the emails between Mr. Fox, my mother, I just wanted a--
[02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:07.460]   So he--
[02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:13.540]   I wanted like a meteor to hit my particular spot on the earth right then and there just
[02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:14.020]   because it was--
[02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:20.900]   He was manipulating your mom too because your mom loved you and was willing to give money.
[02:31:20.900 --> 02:31:21.140]   Yeah.
[02:31:21.140 --> 02:31:22.020]   Yeah.
[02:31:22.020 --> 02:31:23.300]   And it was really grotesque.
[02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:25.140]   And so, and I feel like it's my fault.
[02:31:26.660 --> 02:31:30.260]   What's your mom say about this whole situation now looking back?
[02:31:30.260 --> 02:31:38.980]   We don't talk about it as much as one would think that we would because I feel sickening
[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:40.340]   because I feel like it's my fault.
[02:31:40.340 --> 02:31:44.100]   And I think she also feels sick over it.
[02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:47.300]   And so we don't talk about it as much as one might think.
[02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:50.580]   Sometimes I've had to ask questions in the process of writing the book.
[02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:54.740]   And then there are other things where like I could ask the questions, but I just don't
[02:31:54.740 --> 02:32:01.140]   want to because I don't want to put her through that or it's not really necessary to ask the
[02:32:01.140 --> 02:32:04.340]   questions, but there are things that I'm sort of curious about.
[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:07.780]   But--
[02:32:07.780 --> 02:32:15.540]   When you went on that road trip from hell, what was that like?
[02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:16.980]   Where'd you guys go first?
[02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:17.460]   Vegas?
[02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:21.460]   So you drove from New York, where?
[02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:27.060]   It was a series of stops at like hotel, motel type places.
[02:32:27.060 --> 02:32:29.620]   I did a similar road trip, but from Boston.
[02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:33.540]   I drove across the United States with no destination.
[02:32:33.540 --> 02:32:34.980]   I had always wanted to do that.
[02:32:34.980 --> 02:32:38.100]   And now, again, I feel like it's one of those things that's sort of like ruined for me because
[02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:39.140]   a lot of--
[02:32:39.140 --> 02:32:40.580]   You know, you can always reclaim it.
[02:32:40.580 --> 02:32:42.340]   Yeah, I could.
[02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:44.420]   But now, yeah.
[02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:49.780]   I did think about like how one day if I did some sort of a book tour or something that
[02:32:49.780 --> 02:32:53.860]   I imagine this Leon and I in a car.
[02:32:53.860 --> 02:32:55.860]   It has to be different than--
[02:32:55.860 --> 02:33:08.500]   Man, book tours, if you're not careful, can suck the soul out of a human being.
[02:33:08.500 --> 02:33:10.580]   I think you have to do like a Hunter S. Thompson style
[02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:16.420]   book tour where you miss a bunch of the dates because you got too drunk the night before.
[02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:17.300]   But anyway--
[02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:22.900]   Or I just-- what I worry about is that I just would be feeling terrible in some way and
[02:33:22.900 --> 02:33:25.460]   not be up for it.
[02:33:25.460 --> 02:33:28.740]   Up for the trip or up for the speaking?
[02:33:28.740 --> 02:33:31.060]   For like a certain type of appearance.
[02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:38.420]   I think I'm always afraid of that in committing to things like if it involved
[02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:41.860]   going to a big public event.
[02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:43.380]   Yeah, I think you have to be very careful.
[02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:45.220]   Like podcast is an interesting one.
[02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:49.140]   I'm always surprised that people just jump on podcasts they haven't really listened to
[02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:53.700]   and just do a lot of podcasts, a kind of book tour.
[02:33:53.700 --> 02:33:56.340]   First of all, financially it doesn't make any sense.
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:59.780]   Especially going on small podcasts, like what's the benefit?
[02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:03.780]   Like really you want to go on just a couple of big podcasts that you're actually a fan of.
[02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:04.580]   Right.
[02:34:04.580 --> 02:34:06.180]   It's really, really, really important.
[02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:10.420]   People don't-- like they don't understand the power.
[02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:12.420]   I mean, maybe you just don't understand podcasting.
[02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:18.260]   But me as a fan of podcasts, it's like the biggest thing I love listening to is
[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:25.380]   when a guest is a fan, they understand the culture, the style, the sound, the feel of
[02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:26.020]   the podcast.
[02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:27.220]   They understand the other person.
[02:34:27.220 --> 02:34:33.700]   They feel the pain, the hopes of the other person, the weird like quirks of the other
[02:34:33.700 --> 02:34:34.420]   person.
[02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:36.340]   It makes for much better listening.
[02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:39.940]   And ultimately the appearance itself is not just enough to sell the book.
[02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:42.980]   You have to-- you're selling yourself as a human being.
[02:34:42.980 --> 02:34:45.380]   And that requires having chemistry and all those kinds of things.
[02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:46.580]   Yeah, I agree.
[02:34:46.580 --> 02:34:50.020]   And podcast appearance is exhausting.
[02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:52.420]   Like you're giving a lot of yourself.
[02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:53.060]   It's intimate.
[02:34:53.060 --> 02:34:53.700]   It's deep.
[02:34:53.700 --> 02:34:54.260]   Like, I don't know.
[02:34:54.260 --> 02:34:57.780]   Anyway, road trip.
[02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:00.340]   You don't remember the motels and the hotels along the way?
[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:04.260]   Well, there are a lot of things where like I'll remember things that happened,
[02:35:04.260 --> 02:35:05.620]   but I don't remember where it was.
[02:35:06.260 --> 02:35:09.460]   Things you drove without a destination, really.
[02:35:09.460 --> 02:35:16.580]   I assume he must have known ahead of time, but he made it seem like, "Oh, funny we
[02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:17.540]   ended up in Vegas."
[02:35:17.540 --> 02:35:20.260]   Funny how that happened.
[02:35:20.260 --> 02:35:26.020]   But now when I see all the places that we stopped, they were all places with-- where
[02:35:26.020 --> 02:35:26.980]   there were casinos.
[02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:30.980]   So there's a lot more casinos around the country than I knew.
[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:36.100]   And they're-- so--
[02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:38.020]   So he had a gambling addiction?
[02:35:38.020 --> 02:35:45.620]   Yes, but I think that it's not-- so I think that regular people have gambling addictions,
[02:35:45.620 --> 02:35:49.060]   and it's a horrible, tragic thing and can destroy their lives.
[02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:56.260]   And I know people who've-- like regular people can have a gambling addiction, which is explained
[02:35:56.260 --> 02:35:58.020]   in the way that addictions are explained.
[02:35:59.220 --> 02:36:07.700]   For him, I don't think it was so much an addiction as like a thrill-seeking, because he could
[02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:09.860]   win money, lose money, and he didn't really care.
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:16.660]   Whereas somebody who has an actual addiction and then all normal people with normal human
[02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:25.540]   emotions, you know, would either be elated and relieved or devastated to lose a lot of
[02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:25.860]   money.
[02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:28.340]   And for him, it didn't really care.
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:30.580]   It was more-- again, I think it was more just like a game.
[02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:33.220]   Like what was going through your mind here?
[02:36:33.220 --> 02:36:34.660]   Like, would you be on the run?
[02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:35.860]   Did you feel like you were on the run?
[02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:37.460]   No.
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:38.660]   Did you know you were on the run?
[02:36:38.660 --> 02:36:40.660]   No.
[02:36:40.660 --> 02:36:46.980]   So I didn't know that-- I mean, the other thing is the restaurant was operating, and
[02:36:46.980 --> 02:36:48.340]   he took me away.
[02:36:48.340 --> 02:36:53.060]   And then like people weren't paid, and it all sort of fell apart.
[02:36:53.060 --> 02:36:55.860]   And you weren't checking your texts or any of that?
[02:36:55.860 --> 02:36:57.060]   No.
[02:36:57.060 --> 02:37:00.340]   And then he had my phone and my email.
[02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:09.780]   I did later on get-- later on, I got a brand new phone, like an empty phone with no existing
[02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:18.500]   numbers in it or whatnot, so that he and I could communicate when I went to the grocery
[02:37:18.500 --> 02:37:19.460]   store or something like that.
[02:37:19.460 --> 02:37:22.260]   What was the reason he had the phone?
[02:37:22.500 --> 02:37:27.140]   What was the narrative, the story that he was taking over your phone?
[02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:33.860]   How did you allow that to happen?
[02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:38.500]   Or maybe a better way to ask is, how did he make that happen?
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:46.420]   Well, I was conditioned to it before, because before he was always checking my phone, which
[02:37:47.860 --> 02:37:50.180]   was wildly infuriating.
[02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:51.060]   And I feel like--
[02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:55.220]   You fixed it by giving him the phone.
[02:37:55.220 --> 02:37:59.300]   Well, I mean, the conditions were different later on.
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:02.980]   But in some sense, I didn't want my phone, because everything-- like I was in a state
[02:38:02.980 --> 02:38:03.780]   of shock.
[02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:06.260]   And it was just like, take it, fine.
[02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:07.060]   Like, I'd give up.
[02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:08.340]   Like, I guess I'd given up.
[02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:12.420]   And so, yeah, I'd given up.
[02:38:12.420 --> 02:38:14.820]   So there was no-- like I wasn't going to fight back on anything.
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:20.100]   Before, when he would take my phone and look through it, it was infuriating.
[02:38:20.100 --> 02:38:23.620]   And he sort of forced me to get used to it.
[02:38:23.620 --> 02:38:28.900]   And this is, again, something that people who've been in cults would understand, because
[02:38:28.900 --> 02:38:33.780]   it's like they condition you to not react negatively to things that you would normally
[02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:34.820]   react negatively to.
[02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:44.180]   And if I was in a relationship-- like, if somebody-- I would never, ever look in somebody's
[02:38:44.180 --> 02:38:44.500]   phone.
[02:38:45.780 --> 02:38:49.540]   And if somebody did that to me, I would be like, goodbye.
[02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:53.700]   So I'm pretty sensitive about that.
[02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:59.220]   And so it was very infuriating when he would take my phone and look at it.
[02:38:59.220 --> 02:39:06.820]   And it got to the point where not only did I feel like everything I said or wrote or
[02:39:06.820 --> 02:39:14.500]   emailed digitally or whatnot would be read, but he got me to the point of feeling like
[02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:20.580]   I was being watched all the time in a non-explainable way.
[02:39:20.580 --> 02:39:25.940]   Yeah, what were some of the-- you didn't mention them-- the documentary touched on some of
[02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:26.180]   them.
[02:39:26.180 --> 02:39:28.980]   What are some of the fantastical stories?
[02:39:28.980 --> 02:39:34.660]   So he mentioned that he might help make Leon immortal.
[02:39:34.660 --> 02:39:36.740]   What--
[02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:40.340]   All of that was always really vague, intentionally.
[02:39:40.340 --> 02:39:42.980]   Like a lot of what he talked about was always very vague.
[02:39:43.780 --> 02:39:46.420]   But a lot of that stuff was very vague.
[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:47.620]   And again, like--
[02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:48.500]   But convincing.
[02:39:48.500 --> 02:39:49.860]   Slowly over time.
[02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:56.580]   And a lot of those things, too, are things that, you know, conveniently you kind of can't
[02:39:56.580 --> 02:39:57.220]   disprove.
[02:39:57.220 --> 02:40:02.900]   So it's almost like, you know, people believe in God or religious people believe certain
[02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:03.220]   things.
[02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:11.860]   And so one could argue, why is it that much crazier for me to have been open to the idea
[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:18.980]   that, you know, maybe Leon, maybe we do live forever in some way when a lot of religious
[02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:20.900]   people have similar beliefs.
[02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:27.620]   So one of the-- the other thing is he was-- maybe you can correct me, but reincarnated
[02:40:27.620 --> 02:40:28.500]   or something like that?
[02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:30.580]   Or like--
[02:40:30.580 --> 02:40:39.540]   He acted like he had lived many lifetimes and had all kinds of wisdom from having lived
[02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:44.020]   all these prior lifetimes and being aware of it.
[02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:49.460]   So was that-- and it was vague, but it was somehow believable?
[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:51.140]   Or is it just like part of the charm?
[02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:57.860]   Like what-- how do you-- how do you not call bullshit?
[02:40:57.860 --> 02:40:59.620]   I know.
[02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:02.100]   Well, not necessarily bullshit.
[02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:05.540]   I understand when you're smitten in whatever way.
[02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:17.780]   But like a little more details, proof, I suppose it's easy to just, you know, like put it off
[02:41:17.780 --> 02:41:18.340]   for later.
[02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:21.060]   Assume that more details will come later.
[02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:21.380]   Right.
[02:41:21.380 --> 02:41:25.860]   I think he's a mentalist or an illusionist named Darren Brown.
[02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:29.860]   And it was on a Joe Rogan podcast.
[02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:32.100]   I think Joe interviewed Darren Brown.
[02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:35.540]   I think Sam Harris interviewed him.
[02:41:35.540 --> 02:41:37.060]   I got really intrigued.
[02:41:37.060 --> 02:41:42.660]   And then I was looking for other podcasts or maybe Joe interviewed him like right after.
[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:44.420]   I may have gone looking for it.
[02:41:44.420 --> 02:41:48.340]   But anyway, it was in the-- it was in the conversation with Joe where Darren explains
[02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:54.580]   he's somebody I would love to meet, a mentalist and illusionist, because they understand a
[02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:56.580]   lot of the ways in which the mind can be manipulated.
[02:41:56.580 --> 02:42:00.900]   So I feel like they would-- if they looked at everything about my situation, they would
[02:42:00.900 --> 02:42:07.300]   be able to understand better how he was able to get me to believe things or go along with
[02:42:07.300 --> 02:42:07.540]   things.
[02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:11.700]   Because Darren Brown is pretty fascinating what he does.
[02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:14.900]   And he's really seems like a very kind person.
[02:42:14.900 --> 02:42:16.420]   And he's very open about it.
[02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:21.940]   And when he was talking to Joe, he said this thing that-- and I use this quote in my book.
[02:42:21.940 --> 02:42:27.460]   And again, I'm paraphrasing because I don't have it in front of me.
[02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:35.860]   But it's like he says something about how we want to believe the lie because we'd rather
[02:42:35.860 --> 02:42:40.580]   believe that it's something amazing than just that ugly and pathetic a lie.
[02:42:40.580 --> 02:42:45.220]   And I-- whatever he said was said in a much better way.
[02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:50.500]   But the point is like that's-- and so he was explaining it in the context of the way that
[02:42:50.500 --> 02:42:56.820]   an illusionist or whatever they're called is able to pull off certain things, which
[02:42:56.820 --> 02:43:02.900]   is that they're sort of-- it was about somebody who was watching and watched them-- watched
[02:43:02.900 --> 02:43:09.780]   that person sort of leverage people's tendency to want to believe that something amazing
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:14.260]   and cool is about to happen versus like this is just a really ugly, pathetic lie.
[02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:24.100]   So I think that a lot of the things that Mr. Fox-- that he put forward, I couldn't understand
[02:43:24.100 --> 02:43:28.660]   it from the perspective of it being a lie because it just seemed too weird and crazy.
[02:43:28.660 --> 02:43:36.740]   So I think that this happens sometimes where you believe somebody because it seems so weird
[02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:39.140]   that they would lie about it.
[02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:44.260]   I think that somebody has-- or it's been said sometimes that like the more fantastical the
[02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:49.700]   lie, the more believable it is because you don't believe that somebody would tell that
[02:43:49.700 --> 02:43:50.580]   lie.
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:56.740]   And I think something also that Mr. Fox-- people like him are capable of doing is going
[02:43:56.740 --> 02:44:01.220]   out and lying in very brazen ways that normal people would be terrified to do.
[02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:03.860]   That kind of also makes it more believable.
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:04.500]   Yeah.
[02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:12.580]   So if somebody could go out on a world stage and lie and not kind of feel weird about that
[02:44:12.580 --> 02:44:17.300]   or even knowing that it's a lie that can be pointed out as being a lie.
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:26.340]   And then there's also the layer of to what extent is this person in some way also delusional
[02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:28.420]   themselves and sort of believing their lies?
[02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:30.500]   Because people have asked me that and I've wondered the same thing.
[02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:34.100]   To what extent did he believe some of the stuff he was saying?
[02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:40.820]   And I think probably there was some sort of delusional aspect, almost like he was sort
[02:44:40.820 --> 02:44:47.220]   of halfway aware of playing his own sort of virtual reality game.
[02:44:48.500 --> 02:44:51.540]   Like he was in some kind of metaverse in his brain.
[02:44:51.540 --> 02:44:53.700]   So you think he believed some of the things he was saying?
[02:44:53.700 --> 02:44:55.780]   In some way, yeah.
[02:44:55.780 --> 02:44:58.420]   Or he wanted to.
[02:44:58.420 --> 02:45:02.020]   Because he wanted to be his own-- he wanted to be a superhero.
[02:45:02.020 --> 02:45:06.500]   He never built anything or created anything or accomplished anything in his life.
[02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:13.300]   Yet, so in his own brain, if he could turn himself into a movie superhero--
[02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:14.260]   It's a nice shortcut.
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:16.340]   What about the Navy SEAL thing?
[02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:18.660]   Did that ever get resolved?
[02:45:18.660 --> 02:45:26.020]   You know, the lie that he-- no, he said that he's a Navy SEAL.
[02:45:26.020 --> 02:45:27.220]   I don't remember.
[02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:32.260]   I don't know if he said he was a Navy SEAL or that he implied that he worked with the
[02:45:32.260 --> 02:45:38.100]   CIA or then it was like he worked with black ops that is by definition under the radar.
[02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:39.300]   Right?
[02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:43.780]   So I mean, that's obviously a huge red flag now going forward is like if somebody--
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:49.860]   first of all, if somebody tells you that information pretty quickly, that's itself a red flag.
[02:45:49.860 --> 02:45:51.860]   But I mean--
[02:45:51.860 --> 02:45:56.660]   All right, cross that off my list of pick up lines.
[02:45:56.660 --> 02:46:06.100]   But you know, conveniently, if he say in some world he actually did work for like Blackwater,
[02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:07.140]   one of those places, or--
[02:46:07.140 --> 02:46:08.740]   Yeah.
[02:46:08.740 --> 02:46:13.300]   I wouldn't be able to just call someplace and verify it.
[02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:22.660]   Anyway, so I think that in some psychological way that I don't understand, he probably did
[02:46:22.660 --> 02:46:30.980]   in some way halfway exist in this world where he was this, you know, like fighter.
[02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:35.220]   And he would say things like, it's because of people like me that people like you can
[02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:38.900]   sleep at night, which is probably a line out of a movie that I've never seen.
[02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:39.940]   I feel like a lot of things--
[02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:40.340]   That's great.
[02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:41.540]   That's a great-- that's funny.
[02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:44.820]   That is a-- who said that?
[02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:45.780]   That's--
[02:46:45.780 --> 02:46:47.780]   Is that really a line out of a movie?
[02:46:47.780 --> 02:46:48.580]   It's not a movie.
[02:46:48.580 --> 02:46:55.220]   You know, what would happen at Rikers is when these things would happen where one of us
[02:46:55.220 --> 02:46:58.740]   couldn't think of something and you're like, oh, who was that actor in that movie and that thing?
[02:46:58.740 --> 02:46:59.860]   No.
[02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:04.660]   And so what we do is like somebody would be on the phone and you'd be like, hey, who are
[02:47:04.660 --> 02:47:05.540]   you talking to?
[02:47:05.540 --> 02:47:08.180]   Can you ask them to look up on their phone?
[02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:12.820]   So we'd ask people on the phone or somebody would go make a call and, you know, you'd
[02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:17.380]   have to call somebody and ask them to Google the cast of a movie or something like that.
[02:47:17.380 --> 02:47:20.820]   I think you would find jail-- don't ever get arrested or try not to, but I think you would
[02:47:20.820 --> 02:47:22.500]   find jail fascinating.
[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:28.340]   Oh, I always wanted to go to jail, prison, because there's a lot of elements to it and
[02:47:28.340 --> 02:47:31.780]   I'll ask you questions about it, but I feel like I can get a lot of reading done.
[02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:34.020]   I got a ton of reading done.
[02:47:34.020 --> 02:47:34.660]   Yeah, yeah, yes.
[02:47:34.660 --> 02:47:35.780]   I remember now.
[02:47:35.780 --> 02:47:40.260]   People attribute this to George Orwell, but they're not sure if George Orwell ever said
[02:47:40.260 --> 02:47:45.860]   it, but it's something like there's a lot of different variations, but we sleep safely
[02:47:45.860 --> 02:47:50.500]   at night because rough men stand ready to visit violence on those who would harm us.
[02:47:50.500 --> 02:47:56.900]   And there's a lot of variations of this, but basically we depend-- our entire society depends
[02:47:56.900 --> 02:48:03.700]   on bad motherfuckers who are willing to fight to protect our freedoms, to protect our
[02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:09.300]   well-being, and one of the things about the United States is because we're surrounded
[02:48:09.300 --> 02:48:17.940]   by water, we don't get to see the violence that's required in part to protect the sovereignty
[02:48:17.940 --> 02:48:18.580]   of nations.
[02:48:18.580 --> 02:48:29.140]   You mentioned that I would-- not to go to prison, but that I may enjoy my time there.
[02:48:29.140 --> 02:48:29.940]   Let me ask you--
[02:48:29.940 --> 02:48:33.060]   By the way, I love prison movies.
[02:48:33.060 --> 02:48:34.260]   You would find it fascinating.
[02:48:34.260 --> 02:48:38.820]   I don't because it's still kind of too soon, but--
[02:48:38.820 --> 02:48:39.780]   Well, how was your time?
[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:43.700]   You spent three and a half months at Rikers.
[02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:44.740]   How was that?
[02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:46.660]   How was your experience in prison?
[02:48:46.660 --> 02:48:51.380]   How's the food from a chef perspective?
[02:48:51.380 --> 02:48:59.460]   Not good, but Rikers was-- when I got to Rikers-- so I was arrested.
[02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:03.780]   I spent, I think, about 10 days in a small town Tennessee jail.
[02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:09.220]   Oh, Pigeon Forge is also the weirdest place on earth.
[02:49:09.220 --> 02:49:10.260]   Is it a town?
[02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:11.860]   Yes, it's a town where I was arrested.
[02:49:11.860 --> 02:49:13.220]   Why is it so weird?
[02:49:13.220 --> 02:49:18.660]   In the film, I told them, "You have to go to Pigeon Forge.
[02:49:18.660 --> 02:49:19.300]   You have to go there.
[02:49:19.300 --> 02:49:20.260]   You have to go there."
[02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:25.380]   And I think I was pushing them because it was going to potentially be the end of the
[02:49:25.380 --> 02:49:30.500]   season. It's like a summertime or it's a tourist destination.
[02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:39.780]   And it's so bizarre and weird and trippy that it doesn't even seem real.
[02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:42.180]   Seems like a carnival is happening there nonstop.
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:43.300]   Exactly.
[02:49:43.300 --> 02:49:49.060]   I think I say that in my intro that it's carnivalesque and trippy and weird.
[02:49:49.060 --> 02:49:52.900]   Is there a lot of clowns walking around?
[02:49:52.900 --> 02:49:59.460]   Not necessarily clowns, but there is a video on YouTube that I-- because I got to the chapter
[02:49:59.460 --> 02:50:04.500]   where we arrive in Pigeon Forge, and I'll never forget, although I have forgotten,
[02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:12.580]   but I remember being like, weirdly, like, felt like we had entered a different universe,
[02:50:12.580 --> 02:50:16.900]   driving down this strip and just looking at everything on either side.
[02:50:16.900 --> 02:50:20.820]   And I'm wishing that I could remember in more detail, like, the names of the places or what
[02:50:20.820 --> 02:50:25.060]   was there, because I wanted to describe it in this chapter.
[02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:29.620]   And I was like, "I wish there was a video of somebody going down the street, kind of
[02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:31.780]   showing what's on one side and then the other side."
[02:50:31.780 --> 02:50:33.940]   And I was like, "There probably is."
[02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:35.140]   And there is on YouTube.
[02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:37.060]   Like, I found it and I watched the whole thing.
[02:50:37.060 --> 02:50:38.980]   How does this come up from prison exactly?
[02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:41.540]   Oh, okay.
[02:50:41.540 --> 02:50:42.340]   Why did that spark you?
[02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:44.340]   So that's the town that I went to jail in.
[02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:46.020]   Oh, right.
[02:50:46.020 --> 02:50:46.660]   In Tennessee.
[02:50:46.660 --> 02:50:47.460]   So--
[02:50:47.460 --> 02:50:48.180]   What was that like?
[02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:55.060]   The food there and some of the conditions, the food made--
[02:50:55.060 --> 02:50:55.780]   When I got to--
[02:50:55.780 --> 02:50:58.980]   Then I was extradited and transferred to Rikers.
[02:50:58.980 --> 02:51:02.980]   And when I got to Rikers, I felt like it was like the Four Seasons in comparison.
[02:51:02.980 --> 02:51:04.120]   Wow.
[02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:12.420]   And I really kind of appreciated a lot of things about New York when I got to Rikers,
[02:51:12.420 --> 02:51:15.460]   even though there are a lot of things that are very scary about it.
[02:51:15.460 --> 02:51:17.540]   Where's Rikers located?
[02:51:17.540 --> 02:51:18.740]   Is it close to New York City?
[02:51:19.300 --> 02:51:19.780]   Yes.
[02:51:19.780 --> 02:51:24.260]   And in a very kind of almost poetically interesting way,
[02:51:24.260 --> 02:51:29.380]   the dorm room where I was when I was there for the three and a half months
[02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:31.380]   was one of the ones that faced Manhattan.
[02:51:31.380 --> 02:51:36.660]   So I could go across the room and look out the window and see the whole Manhattan skyline.
[02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:37.220]   To the view.
[02:51:37.220 --> 02:51:38.660]   Which was--
[02:51:38.660 --> 02:51:46.500]   I remember being shocked by the cost per prisoner per year.
[02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:47.720]   Yes.
[02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:52.740]   That New York pays is like $400,000, $500,000 or something.
[02:51:52.740 --> 02:51:54.580]   I didn't think it was that much.
[02:51:54.580 --> 02:51:56.420]   I thought I wrote it down, but either way it is--
[02:51:56.420 --> 02:52:03.380]   No, I mean, it's elevated during COVID, which is fascinating, to that, the number I just said.
[02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:04.760]   Yeah.
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:09.380]   During COVID, I felt sick to my stomach thinking about people stuck there.
[02:52:09.380 --> 02:52:12.340]   And again, so Rikers isn't like a long-term prison.
[02:52:12.340 --> 02:52:16.420]   It's most of the people at Rikers are awaiting trial.
[02:52:16.980 --> 02:52:19.300]   And they've been arrested but not convicted.
[02:52:19.300 --> 02:52:22.500]   And then if you're convicted and you're sentenced to less than a year,
[02:52:22.500 --> 02:52:26.180]   then you put on a different color uniform and you go upstairs to different dorms.
[02:52:26.180 --> 02:52:29.700]   If you're convicted and sentenced to more than a year,
[02:52:29.700 --> 02:52:31.540]   you're sent to one of the upstate prisons.
[02:52:31.540 --> 02:52:35.540]   So most of the people at Rikers are there in transition.
[02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:36.820]   They've been arrested but not--
[02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:42.820]   They've been arrested but not convicted or awaiting trial.
[02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:46.660]   So you could be perfectly innocent and you're stuck there.
[02:52:46.980 --> 02:52:48.420]   And that happens to a lot of people.
[02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:56.260]   Or you could be arrested over some kind of comparatively petty thing or nonviolent thing
[02:52:56.260 --> 02:53:02.900]   and stuck there because you don't have as little as $500 to pay bail,
[02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:06.580]   which is completely messed up and unjust.
[02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:11.940]   And I think most people, most reasonable people agree that it's unjust.
[02:53:11.940 --> 02:53:15.860]   But it's different when you're there and you see those people and you see
[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:20.580]   the anguish and whether--
[02:53:20.580 --> 02:53:22.420]   I mean, I have no idea if they're guilty of what--
[02:53:22.420 --> 02:53:26.900]   I mean, I usually don't know what people are there for, what the situation is.
[02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:32.500]   But you watch the sort of helplessness set in
[02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:35.620]   because you're kind of powerless there.
[02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:37.540]   You have very little contact with the outside world.
[02:53:37.540 --> 02:53:39.060]   You have these limited phone calls.
[02:53:39.060 --> 02:53:43.300]   And so for people who had kids and a job and an apartment,
[02:53:43.300 --> 02:53:48.100]   it's like one by one those things are lost or their kids are now being looked after
[02:53:48.100 --> 02:53:50.740]   by their abusive ex-husband or something like that.
[02:53:50.740 --> 02:53:53.780]   And so watching that is just gut-wrenching.
[02:53:53.780 --> 02:53:59.300]   And then also knowing that the only reason they're unable to get out
[02:53:59.300 --> 02:54:04.100]   is because of $1,000, $2,000, in some cases $500.
[02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:04.660]   There were people--
[02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:09.780]   So there's all of these tragic cases.
[02:54:09.780 --> 02:54:12.820]   But then there was also, while I was there--
[02:54:12.820 --> 02:54:16.340]   I mean, if I'd had any money, I would have been wanting to bail people out left and right.
[02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:20.580]   And then in some cases, I think there was a woman there who snored really loud
[02:54:20.580 --> 02:54:22.020]   and her bail was $500.
[02:54:22.020 --> 02:54:25.860]   And I was like, I wish I had him.
[02:54:25.860 --> 02:54:26.820]   I want to bail her.
[02:54:26.820 --> 02:54:31.460]   She just wanted to bail her out because I'm pretty sensitive to sounds.
[02:54:31.460 --> 02:54:34.020]   And being in a room with 50 people, inevitably--
[02:54:34.020 --> 02:54:37.860]   So you're in a room with a large number of people.
[02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:42.180]   Yeah, there are areas there with cells.
[02:54:42.180 --> 02:54:48.260]   But a lot of the areas there are rooms with 50 beds.
[02:54:48.260 --> 02:54:50.660]   And they're about three feet apart from each other.
[02:54:50.660 --> 02:54:54.260]   So during COVID, there was certainly no social distancing.
[02:54:54.260 --> 02:55:01.220]   And that just felt kind of sickening, especially because so many of the people
[02:55:01.220 --> 02:55:08.420]   are there for non-violent things or drug addiction-related or mental health issues.
[02:55:09.940 --> 02:55:16.340]   How did that-- you personally, just having spent that time there for three and a half months,
[02:55:16.340 --> 02:55:17.220]   how did that change you?
[02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:22.980]   Like, what-- did that have an effect on your mind?
[02:55:22.980 --> 02:55:37.220]   On my mind, personally, I think I was surprised at how well I adapted.
[02:55:37.220 --> 02:55:42.420]   And then how I was able to-- and then I think I sort of took it a next level when
[02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:47.300]   one of the books somebody sent me was The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer.
[02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:50.260]   And it's very much about observing your mind.
[02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:55.220]   And that kind of helped take it a next level.
[02:55:55.220 --> 02:55:57.940]   Was this like a meditation retreat for you?
[02:55:57.940 --> 02:56:06.900]   Well, it'd be like trying to meditate in the middle of a circus or in crazy circumstances.
[02:56:06.900 --> 02:56:08.340]   Because you're never alone.
[02:56:08.340 --> 02:56:09.620]   There's nowhere to be alone.
[02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:10.100]   And there's always--
[02:56:10.100 --> 02:56:10.900]   People are talking.
[02:56:10.900 --> 02:56:11.700]   There's noises.
[02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:12.260]   There's--
[02:56:12.260 --> 02:56:14.020]   Fighting, noises, chaos.
[02:56:14.020 --> 02:56:16.260]   Did you feel in danger?
[02:56:16.260 --> 02:56:19.320]   Yes.
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:27.620]   But I never felt terrified there.
[02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:33.220]   One of my friends-- the bathroom is the scary place, because they don't have cameras in the
[02:56:33.220 --> 02:56:36.100]   bathrooms.
[02:56:36.100 --> 02:56:39.460]   So that's sort of a-- one has to watch out there.
[02:56:39.460 --> 02:56:44.580]   And I did-- one of my friends who I-- one of the people I was friends with there, she did get
[02:56:44.580 --> 02:56:48.180]   beat up a bit in the bathroom one day.
[02:56:48.180 --> 02:56:51.940]   A lot of weird shit happened in the bathroom.
[02:56:51.940 --> 02:57:01.380]   But it was-- if you're interested in human behavior and psychology, and it can be fascinating
[02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:03.140]   to kind of sit there and watch things.
[02:57:03.140 --> 02:57:05.700]   You're saying you might enjoy prison for that perspective.
[02:57:05.700 --> 02:57:14.260]   You get to watch human nature at its-- I don't want to say that it's worse, but the full variety
[02:57:14.260 --> 02:57:17.300]   that it can take.
[02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:17.540]   Right.
[02:57:17.540 --> 02:57:19.620]   And there was a lot of beauty there as well.
[02:57:19.620 --> 02:57:20.260]   I mean--
[02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:20.980]   Was there love?
[02:57:20.980 --> 02:57:25.300]   People being-- well, again, it depends on the definition of love.
[02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:30.100]   But people being incredibly generous and kind to each other.
[02:57:30.740 --> 02:57:34.660]   Sometimes people singing at night.
[02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:44.500]   There was just a lot of-- and then there was a lot of hilarious stuff.
[02:57:44.500 --> 02:57:45.540]   It's just-- it's all there.
[02:57:45.540 --> 02:57:51.220]   There's like-- there's tragic things, interesting things.
[02:57:51.220 --> 02:57:58.420]   A lot of people with mental health issues, which can be difficult to witness.
[02:57:58.420 --> 02:58:00.020]   So a very different experience.
[02:58:00.020 --> 02:58:08.260]   I should ask you this, but somebody that's currently in prison, Galene Maxwell.
[02:58:08.260 --> 02:58:14.580]   I believe she spent approximately 500 days in isolation.
[02:58:14.580 --> 02:58:19.860]   So it's a very different prison experience.
[02:58:19.860 --> 02:58:21.940]   But what do you think about her case?
[02:58:21.940 --> 02:58:24.100]   What do you think about her and Jeffrey Epstein?
[02:58:25.140 --> 02:58:36.020]   She-- so her brother, her family, she says that she's a victim, not the monster.
[02:58:36.020 --> 02:58:44.740]   I think this is an especially fascinating case because-- and I have listened to podcasts about
[02:58:44.740 --> 02:58:46.500]   the Epstein situation.
[02:58:46.500 --> 02:58:54.020]   And there was one that was more focused on her by Vicki Ward that I would definitely
[02:58:54.020 --> 02:58:58.820]   listen to. Vicki Ward is a journalist.
[02:58:58.820 --> 02:59:01.860]   I think she'd written an article about Jeffrey Epstein for Vanity Fair.
[02:59:01.860 --> 02:59:03.300]   So she got to know Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:59:03.300 --> 02:59:07.700]   And then she knew Galene Maxwell from being sort of part of the
[02:59:07.700 --> 02:59:11.940]   social circle in which they would have overlapped.
[02:59:11.940 --> 02:59:14.500]   Have you, by the way, ever met them since this New York?
[02:59:14.500 --> 02:59:21.460]   Do you remember meeting this, you know, Jeffrey or Galene?
[02:59:21.460 --> 02:59:23.140]   No, I never met them.
[02:59:23.140 --> 02:59:26.020]   But they're also very much like this sort of Upper East Side crowd.
[02:59:26.020 --> 02:59:30.980]   I did meet Harvey Weinstein once that made me have all kinds of interesting thoughts later.
[02:59:30.980 --> 02:59:33.060]   At the restaurant or elsewhere?
[02:59:33.060 --> 02:59:34.420]   No, it was weird.
[02:59:34.420 --> 02:59:35.460]   It was out on the street.
[02:59:35.460 --> 02:59:38.660]   And we had this really strange interaction.
[02:59:38.660 --> 02:59:43.700]   And knowing what I know now, it was eerie.
[02:59:43.700 --> 02:59:49.700]   And also, like, had he contacted me after that and made it seem like he could have done
[02:59:49.700 --> 02:59:56.820]   something for me, like, would I have been, you know, say he said, "Oh, I'm gonna finance your
[02:59:56.820 --> 03:00:01.940]   whole expansion or something and, like, come to my, you know, come meet me at this hotel."
[03:00:01.940 --> 03:00:04.020]   And then I go to that hotel and he's like, "Come up to the room."
[03:00:04.020 --> 03:00:05.060]   And then I would have been like, "Uh."
[03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:08.420]   And you're wondering whether you would have done it.
[03:00:08.420 --> 03:00:10.180]   Yes.
[03:00:10.180 --> 03:00:12.340]   And sadly, I think I would have.
[03:00:12.340 --> 03:00:23.540]   And so I felt a lot of compassion for those who, you know, didn't yell at him and leave
[03:00:23.540 --> 03:00:24.500]   or didn't storm out.
[03:00:24.500 --> 03:00:34.660]   And because I think what happens in those situations is, you know, there's all kinds
[03:00:34.660 --> 03:00:37.220]   of uncertainty in the moment and you sort of freeze.
[03:00:37.220 --> 03:00:42.580]   And then you'll, if I'm probably one of those people that would sit there and somehow in
[03:00:42.580 --> 03:00:49.540]   the moment without clarity, just instinctively feel like somehow I must have done something
[03:00:49.540 --> 03:00:55.380]   wrong and it's my fault and like I led him on and are just being afraid.
[03:00:55.380 --> 03:00:58.100]   And then you don't know how to deal with it.
[03:00:58.100 --> 03:00:58.980]   And so you freeze.
[03:01:00.980 --> 03:01:08.580]   So I think that, you know, if you're somebody that maybe was raised differently or you have
[03:01:08.580 --> 03:01:15.780]   a lot of self-confidence or you might have reacted differently and kind of pushed him
[03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:16.740]   away and stormed out.
[03:01:16.740 --> 03:01:21.620]   But I am probably not one of those people.
[03:01:21.620 --> 03:01:25.140]   But I did not ever meet Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:29.220]   But he seems very straightforwardly, you know, just a classic.
[03:01:29.220 --> 03:01:33.940]   The way he was able to charm people, the way he could step into these roles.
[03:01:33.940 --> 03:01:40.820]   You know, I think he was teaching at Dalton and then just kind of the way he would get
[03:01:40.820 --> 03:01:46.980]   himself into the academic crowd within Harvard and I think also MIT, right?
[03:01:46.980 --> 03:01:53.060]   He sort of, so he's playing a role, but he's doing it so well that he fools all these people.
[03:01:54.020 --> 03:02:00.740]   And the things that people would, in hindsight, say about him are just the same things that
[03:02:00.740 --> 03:02:03.940]   people say about, it's like you hear the same things over and over again.
[03:02:03.940 --> 03:02:08.180]   You hear the same things said about those people who were taken in by Elizabeth Holmes
[03:02:08.180 --> 03:02:12.020]   is that they were, it was as if he was under a spell.
[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:15.940]   It was as if I was under a spell is something you hear a lot.
[03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:22.020]   And so it's like they have this powerful charm that's almost over, it's overwhelming in that
[03:02:22.020 --> 03:02:30.340]   they overwhelm your better judgment or they overwhelm your like normal, otherwise normally
[03:02:30.340 --> 03:02:33.700]   functioning capacity for rational thought.
[03:02:33.700 --> 03:02:36.260]   And they sort of overwhelm that with their charm.
[03:02:36.260 --> 03:02:40.020]   So, you know, when you look at, I think it was like James Mattis invested a bunch of
[03:02:40.020 --> 03:02:43.620]   money with Elizabeth Holmes and all these people were involved with her.
[03:02:43.620 --> 03:02:48.820]   And nobody really did their due diligence where they just sort of trusted her.
[03:02:49.460 --> 03:02:56.020]   And Jeffrey Epstein, I think it's still unclear where he got all of his money, but the guy
[03:02:56.020 --> 03:02:58.180]   Wexner, Les Wexner?
[03:02:58.180 --> 03:02:59.140]   Yeah, Les Wexner.
[03:02:59.140 --> 03:03:04.980]   Who had an enormous amount of money and somehow very quickly turned over management of it to
[03:03:04.980 --> 03:03:06.180]   Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:03:06.180 --> 03:03:08.020]   And so people wonder like, why would he do that?
[03:03:08.020 --> 03:03:08.820]   That's insane.
[03:03:08.820 --> 03:03:13.700]   And then other people have commented about that relationship.
[03:03:13.700 --> 03:03:15.860]   Like it was as if he was under Jeffrey's spell.
[03:03:15.860 --> 03:03:18.580]   Observers would say, I couldn't understand it.
[03:03:18.580 --> 03:03:20.500]   It was as if he was under his spell.
[03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:26.420]   And so somebody observing me and Mr. Fox could have possibly said the same thing about me.
[03:03:26.420 --> 03:03:28.180]   But it's a bit different because it wasn't all charm.
[03:03:28.180 --> 03:03:34.820]   I think Epstein used his charm and then was probably very, very, very crafty and getting
[03:03:34.820 --> 03:03:43.220]   another thing that people like him do and cults do also is to get you somehow compromised
[03:03:43.220 --> 03:03:44.260]   because then they've got you.
[03:03:44.980 --> 03:03:46.340]   So I think...
[03:03:46.340 --> 03:03:48.820]   Some kind of usually sex related.
[03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:50.020]   Yeah.
[03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:53.780]   And with Epstein, certainly, he was known to have cameras everywhere.
[03:03:53.780 --> 03:03:59.300]   And so if he got any of these people on camera doing something compromising and all very
[03:03:59.300 --> 03:04:01.700]   powerful people, then he's got them.
[03:04:01.700 --> 03:04:09.700]   And I think he was also very smart to do that to target people of both parties so that politically
[03:04:10.260 --> 03:04:12.980]   that he was able to maintain his power, like no matter...
[03:04:12.980 --> 03:04:21.380]   Nobody wanted him to be totally exposed because then people, a lot of people would be exposed.
[03:04:21.380 --> 03:04:28.340]   By the way, that part, that's all kind of conspiracy, right?
[03:04:28.340 --> 03:04:29.300]   Right.
[03:04:29.300 --> 03:04:30.180]   We don't know that.
[03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:34.180]   So a lot of people believe that.
[03:04:34.180 --> 03:04:37.780]   And I tend to kind of naturally believe that because it makes sense.
[03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:41.540]   But it's also possible that straight up with charisma.
[03:04:41.540 --> 03:04:45.700]   I mean, he did record people and there were recordings.
[03:04:45.700 --> 03:04:51.380]   So I listened to an interview with a woman who, I mean, was a girl back then.
[03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:53.300]   Maybe she was 15 or 16 back then.
[03:04:53.300 --> 03:05:01.860]   And subsequently, years later, was able to see some of the video of...
[03:05:01.860 --> 03:05:06.260]   I mean, I think that's a verifiable thing that there were video cameras all over his house.
[03:05:06.260 --> 03:05:08.900]   Yeah, but the degree to which it was used.
[03:05:08.900 --> 03:05:09.940]   Right.
[03:05:09.940 --> 03:05:10.660]   We don't know that.
[03:05:10.660 --> 03:05:16.660]   And to the degree of how many people were involved and so on.
[03:05:16.660 --> 03:05:19.140]   There's all kinds of conspiracies around the man.
[03:05:19.140 --> 03:05:20.260]   But the question about...
[03:05:20.260 --> 03:05:21.220]   Her.
[03:05:21.220 --> 03:05:22.900]   Her, Ghislaine.
[03:05:22.900 --> 03:05:26.900]   So I only know what I know from the inputs, which are...
[03:05:26.900 --> 03:05:31.460]   The Vicky Ward, it's one of the podcasts.
[03:05:31.460 --> 03:05:32.660]   It's a narrative podcast.
[03:05:32.660 --> 03:05:40.580]   So it's like an audio kind of a documentary or journalistic piece that she did and put out.
[03:05:40.580 --> 03:05:42.740]   I thought it was really, really well done.
[03:05:42.740 --> 03:05:44.260]   I think it's called Chasing Ghislaine.
[03:05:44.260 --> 03:05:47.620]   And I listened to that whole thing.
[03:05:47.620 --> 03:05:51.220]   I didn't intend to listen to it all in one stretch.
[03:05:51.220 --> 03:05:52.100]   That's how you know it's good.
[03:05:52.100 --> 03:05:57.380]   I mean, it was like a weekend and I basically was cleaning and doing other things and walking
[03:05:57.380 --> 03:05:58.820]   Leon and listening to it.
[03:05:58.820 --> 03:06:00.580]   And I got through it pretty quickly.
[03:06:00.580 --> 03:06:07.700]   But I got really fascinated by it because I don't know, but I think I feel...
[03:06:07.700 --> 03:06:20.420]   I find the whole situation gut-wrenching because I think Jeffrey Epstein is a straight up sociopath.
[03:06:20.420 --> 03:06:21.940]   No question.
[03:06:21.940 --> 03:06:26.580]   With her, everybody's calling her evil.
[03:06:27.780 --> 03:06:36.020]   And for her to have enabled and done a lot of the things that she did could potentially require...
[03:06:36.020 --> 03:06:43.700]   One might say that it could require a lack of empathy to be able to do those things knowingly.
[03:06:43.700 --> 03:06:49.220]   But at the same time, I think...
[03:06:52.020 --> 03:06:58.180]   The information that was conveyed in the Vicki Ward piece was fascinating to me because it's
[03:06:58.180 --> 03:07:01.860]   clear that at the very least, it's like all of these things could be true.
[03:07:01.860 --> 03:07:09.460]   She could maybe be not enough of a good person to have horribly victimized these young girls
[03:07:09.460 --> 03:07:10.900]   and destroy their lives.
[03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:11.540]   But she could have...
[03:07:11.540 --> 03:07:17.300]   I feel like I'm going to get bashed for saying this, but she could have in some way of not
[03:07:17.300 --> 03:07:20.740]   quite known what she was doing or been a bit out of her mind.
[03:07:20.900 --> 03:07:22.980]   Like manipulated, essentially.
[03:07:22.980 --> 03:07:23.940]   Maybe not.
[03:07:23.940 --> 03:07:24.820]   I'm just saying people...
[03:07:24.820 --> 03:07:31.140]   I would hope that people would be open to exploring that as a possibility.
[03:07:31.140 --> 03:07:33.940]   Well, her family and friends are making that case.
[03:07:33.940 --> 03:07:44.420]   They're painting a broad picture of who she is as a human being and showing that she couldn't
[03:07:44.420 --> 03:07:50.820]   have done any of those things without being systematically manipulated.
[03:07:50.820 --> 03:07:52.020]   That's their case.
[03:07:52.020 --> 03:07:52.580]   Right.
[03:07:52.580 --> 03:08:00.660]   What I listened to in that podcast about her relationship with her father, how her father
[03:08:00.660 --> 03:08:08.260]   died, her things about her childhood, and then Epstein coming into her life and basically
[03:08:08.260 --> 03:08:12.260]   pushing all those buttons and becoming the father figure.
[03:08:13.380 --> 03:08:16.180]   She would be in a position of kind of always wanting his approval.
[03:08:16.180 --> 03:08:19.700]   And just the way that...
[03:08:19.700 --> 03:08:31.540]   Things that are described about the way that she was so subservient to him in this kind
[03:08:31.540 --> 03:08:35.700]   of astonishing way that seems really weird and abnormal.
[03:08:35.700 --> 03:08:39.700]   And yet, I think she had a lot of money and connections.
[03:08:39.700 --> 03:08:42.580]   And I think she lost the money but had all the connections.
[03:08:42.580 --> 03:08:50.500]   Either way, there was a lot, a ton that Epstein gained via his relationship with her, a ton.
[03:08:50.500 --> 03:08:55.140]   So it makes sense that he would have manipulated her.
[03:08:55.140 --> 03:08:56.900]   He manipulates everybody.
[03:08:56.900 --> 03:09:01.780]   So without question, I think one could argue he definitely manipulated her.
[03:09:01.780 --> 03:09:08.660]   And again, I want to be careful not to be saying that's an excuse for what she did.
[03:09:08.660 --> 03:09:10.420]   I just think that...
[03:09:11.060 --> 03:09:12.660]   That's one possibility.
[03:09:12.660 --> 03:09:17.460]   It's important to explore these things and be open to them as opposed to just
[03:09:17.460 --> 03:09:20.740]   broad brush painting her as a horrible person.
[03:09:20.740 --> 03:09:26.660]   I mean, because people could say that based on things they've read or things that I did
[03:09:26.660 --> 03:09:28.260]   that I'm a horrible person.
[03:09:28.260 --> 03:09:37.060]   And it's very different because what she did involved young girls whose lives were destroyed.
[03:09:38.980 --> 03:09:48.020]   But I think that people could be a bit open to understanding how somebody could be manipulated.
[03:09:48.020 --> 03:09:55.940]   There's a psychologist that I'm friends with that I got to know after I watched him on
[03:09:55.940 --> 03:09:58.740]   Leah Remini's show.
[03:09:58.740 --> 03:10:04.340]   So Leah Remini is the actress who was in Scientology, got out, and has really been speaking
[03:10:04.340 --> 03:10:10.340]   out about it and trying to expose what they're all about and how diabolical that organization
[03:10:10.340 --> 03:10:10.820]   is.
[03:10:10.820 --> 03:10:16.580]   And a lot of people are exposing them and doing this type of work.
[03:10:16.580 --> 03:10:20.180]   And so she had this guy on her show who was in the Moonies.
[03:10:20.180 --> 03:10:22.980]   His name is Steve Hassen.
[03:10:22.980 --> 03:10:26.340]   And so he was in a cult.
[03:10:26.340 --> 03:10:29.620]   And then he got out, again, by extreme circumstances.
[03:10:29.620 --> 03:10:31.300]   He got in a car accident and almost died.
[03:10:31.300 --> 03:10:35.380]   And that's what ended up getting him out of the cult that he was in.
[03:10:35.380 --> 03:10:40.580]   But really smart guy, was targeted when he was young, got pulled into the Moonies.
[03:10:40.580 --> 03:10:47.380]   But watching this interview of him on her show, he said, he's talking about his experience,
[03:10:47.380 --> 03:10:50.740]   and he said, "If they had told me to kill somebody, I would have."
[03:10:50.740 --> 03:10:54.340]   And that, in that moment, made me cry.
[03:10:54.340 --> 03:10:58.580]   But I also felt like I understand that.
[03:10:59.220 --> 03:11:02.740]   And not that if Mr. Fox had told me to kill somebody, I don't think I would have.
[03:11:02.740 --> 03:11:05.780]   But again, I understand how it could get to that point.
[03:11:05.780 --> 03:11:14.420]   So that makes me feel like with her, like I would be curious what Steve Hassen would
[03:11:14.420 --> 03:11:16.740]   think kind of analyzing the entire situation.
[03:11:16.740 --> 03:11:20.180]   Because it's hard to understand that unless you've been in it.
[03:11:20.180 --> 03:11:23.460]   And I understand with him how he could have said that.
[03:11:23.460 --> 03:11:25.860]   If they had told me to kill somebody, I would have.
[03:11:25.860 --> 03:11:27.860]   That's pretty intense.
[03:11:27.860 --> 03:11:29.060]   I mean, that's pretty extreme.
[03:11:29.060 --> 03:11:35.540]   And it's interesting how you can get into it, how far you can go just one day at a time,
[03:11:35.540 --> 03:11:36.420]   like gradually.
[03:11:36.420 --> 03:11:41.300]   Just like the frog in the boiling water.
[03:11:41.300 --> 03:11:42.820]   So fascinating.
[03:11:42.820 --> 03:11:45.860]   All of these cases are fascinating, like Patty Hearst, that whole story.
[03:11:45.860 --> 03:11:53.140]   Well, I'm just also, I just, it's already a while ago, reread "The Rise and Fall of
[03:11:53.140 --> 03:11:53.860]   the Third Reich."
[03:11:54.420 --> 03:11:58.420]   I've been reading a lot, a lot about Hitler and Goebbels.
[03:11:58.420 --> 03:12:05.700]   For a long time, working on a series about Hitler and the Third Reich.
[03:12:05.700 --> 03:12:08.340]   Because for me, it's like returning.
[03:12:08.340 --> 03:12:16.180]   So much of my family was destroyed or impacted by this time in history.
[03:12:16.180 --> 03:12:24.100]   That it is somehow a way to find out more about myself, is going back to that time.
[03:12:24.340 --> 03:12:26.180]   Have you ever thought about inherited trauma?
[03:12:26.180 --> 03:12:38.900]   This sounds, not to mock people, but this sounds like a thing that...
[03:12:38.900 --> 03:12:40.900]   Like a woke thing?
[03:12:40.900 --> 03:12:43.140]   Like a woke thing, yeah.
[03:12:43.140 --> 03:12:45.300]   I don't mean it that way at all, but I get it.
[03:12:45.300 --> 03:12:50.260]   Because sometimes, now when I say, now I almost have to put air quotes when I say something's
[03:12:50.260 --> 03:12:57.140]   triggering, because I feel like I'm using a word that's now overused or used in less
[03:12:57.140 --> 03:12:57.460]   serious...
[03:12:57.460 --> 03:13:01.700]   So now when I say something's triggering, it's like I use air quotes.
[03:13:01.700 --> 03:13:05.780]   Yeah, it's funny, because good words get taken up and then they get destroyed.
[03:13:05.780 --> 03:13:07.540]   People are overusing gaslighting.
[03:13:07.540 --> 03:13:10.740]   And I worry that that would happen with sociopathy.
[03:13:10.740 --> 03:13:12.820]   I think people need to understand sociopathy.
[03:13:12.820 --> 03:13:16.740]   I think it's critical for humanity that people understand it.
[03:13:16.740 --> 03:13:19.220]   Yeah, so just because you're being an asshole doesn't mean you're sociopathic.
[03:13:19.220 --> 03:13:20.660]   Doesn't mean you're sociopathic, exactly.
[03:13:20.660 --> 03:13:23.540]   And I feel like it's going to be this thing where now everybody's going to start calling
[03:13:23.540 --> 03:13:25.860]   everybody else a sociopath and it's like, "Ugh."
[03:13:25.860 --> 03:13:28.740]   And right now everybody calls everything gaslighting.
[03:13:28.740 --> 03:13:30.740]   If somebody's lying, it's not gaslighting.
[03:13:30.740 --> 03:13:31.540]   I have to talk...
[03:13:31.540 --> 03:13:34.260]   We started talking about, I already forgot, fluff.
[03:13:34.260 --> 03:13:35.140]   Is it fluff?
[03:13:35.140 --> 03:13:36.100]   It's fluff, right?
[03:13:36.100 --> 03:13:37.060]   Fluff, yeah.
[03:13:37.060 --> 03:13:37.780]   Fluff, yeah.
[03:13:37.780 --> 03:13:39.860]   Okay, so that was great.
[03:13:39.860 --> 03:13:41.220]   That's a new discovery for me.
[03:13:41.220 --> 03:13:44.340]   Let's talk about food a little bit, if we can.
[03:13:44.340 --> 03:13:46.980]   You know what?
[03:13:46.980 --> 03:13:48.260]   Let's talk about restaurants first.
[03:13:48.260 --> 03:13:55.300]   What... that's the fascinating part of the story before anything else, which is opening
[03:13:55.300 --> 03:13:59.940]   exceptionally successful restaurant in NYC, New York City.
[03:13:59.940 --> 03:14:00.980]   What's that take?
[03:14:00.980 --> 03:14:07.700]   What does it take to open up from the very beginning, from the idea stage to the launching
[03:14:07.700 --> 03:14:13.700]   it, both the finances and the skill of actually getting people super excited by it and then
[03:14:13.700 --> 03:14:15.700]   running it, all that chaos.
[03:14:15.700 --> 03:14:20.020]   I mean, to me, am I over-romanticizing, but it seems like New York City is a really tough
[03:14:20.020 --> 03:14:23.460]   place to launch a restaurant in.
[03:14:23.460 --> 03:14:24.340]   Yes, very.
[03:14:24.340 --> 03:14:29.140]   Well, I think because it's extremely competitive and the standards are so high.
[03:14:29.140 --> 03:14:36.260]   So I think that's why there are so many good restaurants in New York, because if they're
[03:14:36.260 --> 03:14:37.700]   not good, they're not going to survive.
[03:14:37.700 --> 03:14:42.740]   So even like you could walk into what looks like a hole in the wall and it's going to
[03:14:42.740 --> 03:14:44.100]   have amazing food.
[03:14:44.820 --> 03:14:47.060]   That happens a lot.
[03:14:47.060 --> 03:14:47.940]   So what was the menu?
[03:14:47.940 --> 03:14:52.420]   So was it a raw... was it vegan and raw from the beginning?
[03:14:52.420 --> 03:14:54.100]   Yeah, it was.
[03:14:54.100 --> 03:14:55.620]   And raw means what?
[03:14:55.620 --> 03:14:58.900]   Now I'm getting thrown back to all the interviews I did when people asked me these questions.
[03:14:58.900 --> 03:14:59.700]   It was so long ago.
[03:14:59.700 --> 03:15:01.620]   At the time...
[03:15:01.620 --> 03:15:02.900]   What's it like being vegan?
[03:15:02.900 --> 03:15:09.860]   So nothing was cooked over roughly 118 degrees.
[03:15:09.860 --> 03:15:15.140]   It was this very like... the world of... there were people who are hardcore raw foodists
[03:15:15.140 --> 03:15:20.500]   and there's also people who are hardcore vegans, and I was never any of those things.
[03:15:20.500 --> 03:15:23.380]   So I think what we did...
[03:15:23.380 --> 03:15:24.740]   You weren't the hardcore part?
[03:15:24.740 --> 03:15:25.240]   Yeah.
[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:26.520]   You weren't.
[03:15:26.520 --> 03:15:31.060]   But you... like, what parts of your life were you a vegan?
[03:15:31.060 --> 03:15:32.100]   Are you still a vegan?
[03:15:32.100 --> 03:15:32.820]   Do you eat meat?
[03:15:32.820 --> 03:15:35.380]   Are you a vegetarian?
[03:15:35.380 --> 03:15:36.020]   Are you raw?
[03:15:36.020 --> 03:15:38.500]   Good question.
[03:15:38.500 --> 03:15:41.140]   I don't apply labels.
[03:15:41.140 --> 03:15:43.460]   So none of those labels would apply because it's...
[03:15:43.460 --> 03:15:47.620]   Male and female, that's... I'm beyond those labels myself as well.
[03:15:47.620 --> 03:15:55.140]   But I'm a carnivore most of the time.
[03:15:55.140 --> 03:15:56.900]   There you go.
[03:15:56.900 --> 03:15:58.740]   It's the opposite of vegan, unfortunately.
[03:15:58.740 --> 03:15:59.460]   But no judgment.
[03:15:59.460 --> 03:16:01.780]   I think that's a beautiful thing to be, is vegan.
[03:16:01.780 --> 03:16:06.100]   Likewise, I think that it's people who are very adamantly one way or the other.
[03:16:07.220 --> 03:16:15.060]   I think that after all my years in this world in general,
[03:16:15.060 --> 03:16:22.020]   and also consuming an enormous amount of inputs and podcasts about health,
[03:16:22.020 --> 03:16:23.860]   I love listening to different points of view.
[03:16:23.860 --> 03:16:27.460]   So I love when somebody's arguing vegan and then somebody's arguing carnivore.
[03:16:27.460 --> 03:16:32.260]   Or even with other issues, I like listening to what other people...
[03:16:32.260 --> 03:16:36.580]   opposing sides, assuming they're both intelligent, interesting sources.
[03:16:36.580 --> 03:16:37.380]   Especially when they're...
[03:16:37.380 --> 03:16:41.700]   I love it when they're really testing that diet,
[03:16:41.700 --> 03:16:46.660]   meaning they're athletes or in some way really testing it.
[03:16:46.660 --> 03:16:49.060]   Not just vaguely saying what's healthy or not for you,
[03:16:49.060 --> 03:16:53.220]   but really what is life like under this particular diet?
[03:16:53.220 --> 03:16:56.740]   Yeah. And I think that probably everybody's different.
[03:16:56.740 --> 03:17:00.180]   And so in the same way that some people tolerate...
[03:17:00.180 --> 03:17:05.540]   Some people can't tolerate nightshades, or some people can't tolerate certain spices,
[03:17:05.540 --> 03:17:10.500]   or some people can't tolerate gluten, or some people thrive off of this or that.
[03:17:10.500 --> 03:17:19.140]   And I've heard it said and discussed that there's a great deal to what your body's used to,
[03:17:19.140 --> 03:17:21.140]   what your ancestors ate, where...
[03:17:21.140 --> 03:17:25.060]   Because it seems like the human body is pretty adaptable.
[03:17:25.060 --> 03:17:29.780]   So you can adapt to eating a certain type of food.
[03:17:30.820 --> 03:17:36.100]   And so that if your family comes from a certain part of the world
[03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:39.460]   where certain things aren't grown, or more meat is eaten, or...
[03:17:39.460 --> 03:17:42.980]   Because there's people who are vegan their entire lives,
[03:17:42.980 --> 03:17:45.060]   and they're incredibly healthy, and they thrive.
[03:17:45.060 --> 03:17:50.500]   And there's athletes, and there's people like Rich Roll, who I like, who's vegan and an athlete.
[03:17:50.500 --> 03:17:55.300]   But it might be something where that's working really well for him,
[03:17:55.300 --> 03:17:57.140]   but it wouldn't work well for somebody else.
[03:17:57.140 --> 03:17:59.860]   And I think there's also an element of people who try these things
[03:18:00.580 --> 03:18:04.020]   and then feel really good, or feel really bad.
[03:18:04.020 --> 03:18:08.100]   And they make a conclusion based on that initial period of time,
[03:18:08.100 --> 03:18:11.700]   when it might be something where it makes you feel really good temporarily,
[03:18:11.700 --> 03:18:15.300]   but then over time, you're going to be depleted of certain things.
[03:18:15.300 --> 03:18:18.900]   And then we also live in a world where our soil is depleted,
[03:18:18.900 --> 03:18:23.700]   and there's a lot of processing that takes out of foods, a lot of things that we need.
[03:18:23.700 --> 03:18:30.180]   So I just think that there's no one right answer.
[03:18:30.340 --> 03:18:32.340]   You can look at it from just a health perspective,
[03:18:32.340 --> 03:18:35.700]   and then you can also look at it from a morality and ethics perspective.
[03:18:35.700 --> 03:18:37.700]   And then also, what's the impact on the environment?
[03:18:37.700 --> 03:18:39.380]   And all those things are important.
[03:18:39.380 --> 03:18:45.940]   And I think that I've watched a lot of films and things, and for a while right after that,
[03:18:45.940 --> 03:18:49.060]   I might think, "Oh my God, I can't believe I ate this thing last week,
[03:18:49.060 --> 03:18:51.780]   and now I'm going to go back to being 100% vegan,
[03:18:51.780 --> 03:18:54.420]   because I just watched this thing, and it's fresh in my mind.
[03:18:54.420 --> 03:18:56.340]   And now I'm thinking about it in a certain way."
[03:18:56.340 --> 03:19:01.220]   But then over time, that sort of fades, and then you start to get a bit more loose.
[03:19:01.220 --> 03:19:11.780]   And for me, I will end up eating a lot of things that aren't vegan,
[03:19:11.780 --> 03:19:17.140]   usually in the context where I'm not adding to the consumption of it.
[03:19:17.140 --> 03:19:24.340]   So like at Rikers, most of the meat there was kind of weird and fake,
[03:19:24.340 --> 03:19:29.220]   but there was like a chicken every Thursday and Sunday.
[03:19:29.220 --> 03:19:32.740]   There was actual chicken, like the leg.
[03:19:32.740 --> 03:19:34.580]   Was that the most exciting thing for people?
[03:19:34.580 --> 03:19:37.540]   Oh yeah, oh, and then the most fights broke out on chicken day,
[03:19:37.540 --> 03:19:38.500]   because there was like heightened...
[03:19:38.500 --> 03:19:39.780]   Thursday and Sunday, you said?
[03:19:39.780 --> 03:19:40.180]   Yeah.
[03:19:40.180 --> 03:19:40.740]   Chicken day.
[03:19:40.740 --> 03:19:46.180]   So that was the most real meat you're getting is the chicken.
[03:19:46.180 --> 03:19:47.060]   Yeah, a lot of the rest of it.
[03:19:47.060 --> 03:19:50.420]   Chicken breast or dark, white or dark meat?
[03:19:50.420 --> 03:19:52.340]   Dark is the leg and the thigh.
[03:19:53.620 --> 03:19:55.540]   And it was cooked surprisingly well.
[03:19:55.540 --> 03:19:58.340]   And so I would always eat it.
[03:19:58.340 --> 03:19:58.980]   I don't know.
[03:19:58.980 --> 03:20:02.580]   I mean, it's there, and it's not...
[03:20:02.580 --> 03:20:06.660]   From a health perspective, one could say, "Well, that's probably the shittiest of the
[03:20:06.660 --> 03:20:10.100]   shitty chickens that are full of antibiotics and hormones and terrible things."
[03:20:10.100 --> 03:20:12.980]   So it's not optimal from that point of view.
[03:20:12.980 --> 03:20:18.660]   But it's like if it's otherwise going to be thrown in the trash, then...
[03:20:18.660 --> 03:20:20.660]   Yeah, you're not adding to it.
[03:20:20.660 --> 03:20:20.980]   Right.
[03:20:20.980 --> 03:20:26.580]   Or like I've been drunk at a party and eaten a bunch of stuff that one would think I would
[03:20:26.580 --> 03:20:27.060]   never eat.
[03:20:27.060 --> 03:20:28.500]   Yeah.
[03:20:28.500 --> 03:20:31.780]   But it's not like I ran to the store and bought it or went to a restaurant and ordered it.
[03:20:31.780 --> 03:20:34.980]   Or the same, liquor makes me eat things I shouldn't be eating.
[03:20:34.980 --> 03:20:36.020]   Oh yeah.
[03:20:36.020 --> 03:20:36.900]   Or maybe should.
[03:20:36.900 --> 03:20:38.660]   Well, I think...
[03:20:38.660 --> 03:20:39.060]   Life is...
[03:20:39.060 --> 03:20:45.940]   As you wrote me in the email, life is complicated and fascinating, and so was our decisions
[03:20:45.940 --> 03:20:46.660]   when we're drunk.
[03:20:46.660 --> 03:20:49.940]   I actually am a big fan of 7-Eleven.
[03:20:50.820 --> 03:20:57.220]   I go there sometimes late at night to think about life, and I'll eat whatever the stuff
[03:20:57.220 --> 03:20:58.020]   they have.
[03:20:58.020 --> 03:21:04.580]   I also think it's fascinating how our bodies intuitively know if you're quiet enough, and
[03:21:04.580 --> 03:21:06.500]   you think about what you're craving.
[03:21:06.500 --> 03:21:06.820]   Yeah.
[03:21:06.820 --> 03:21:07.620]   And as long as it's not like...
[03:21:07.620 --> 03:21:08.420]   It tells you.
[03:21:08.420 --> 03:21:12.980]   If you're craving some processed junky food, that's probably something that's not quite
[03:21:12.980 --> 03:21:13.860]   functional.
[03:21:14.820 --> 03:21:22.180]   Sometimes I'll be like, "I must have avocado," or I'll want to eat an entire parsley salad.
[03:21:22.180 --> 03:21:22.900]   And then it's happened.
[03:21:22.900 --> 03:21:24.100]   I went through a phase where...
[03:21:24.100 --> 03:21:27.940]   And here I'm like, "Do I say this out loud?"
[03:21:27.940 --> 03:21:29.460]   I went through a phase of...
[03:21:29.460 --> 03:21:30.420]   Are you gonna say it?
[03:21:30.420 --> 03:21:31.220]   Where I was...
[03:21:31.220 --> 03:21:32.420]   I know, now I have to say it.
[03:21:32.420 --> 03:21:36.100]   Where I couldn't get enough...
[03:21:36.100 --> 03:21:42.660]   I don't know where it started, whose house I was at or whatever, but grass-fed butter.
[03:21:43.300 --> 03:21:47.140]   I was like, I could tell that my body wanted whatever was there.
[03:21:47.140 --> 03:21:51.460]   And so I suppose I could have investigated it and thought, "Well, what's in there?
[03:21:51.460 --> 03:21:53.460]   Is it vitamin K, vitamin D?
[03:21:53.460 --> 03:21:54.740]   What is it in the grass-fed butter?"
[03:21:54.740 --> 03:21:55.700]   'Cause it wasn't regular...
[03:21:55.700 --> 03:21:57.300]   Regular butter, ew, no.
[03:21:57.300 --> 03:22:01.300]   But this grass-fed butter, I felt like I just wanted, I needed it.
[03:22:01.300 --> 03:22:04.260]   So there's probably something in there, and maybe I could have gone and just taken a lot
[03:22:04.260 --> 03:22:06.500]   of vitamin K and then not eaten the butter.
[03:22:06.500 --> 03:22:06.660]   But...
[03:22:06.660 --> 03:22:09.460]   But there is something in there that's fascinating.
[03:22:09.460 --> 03:22:11.620]   I had that last night, actually, with...
[03:22:11.620 --> 03:22:16.260]   I went to a grocery store and I had a craving for tomatoes.
[03:22:16.260 --> 03:22:18.660]   I was like, "What the hell is this?"
[03:22:18.660 --> 03:22:20.260]   Like, what?
[03:22:20.260 --> 03:22:20.500]   I don't...
[03:22:20.500 --> 03:22:24.260]   Right, so I think you should listen to that and then just get a bunch of tomatoes,
[03:22:24.260 --> 03:22:25.620]   'cause there's probably something in there.
[03:22:25.620 --> 03:22:26.820]   It was like...
[03:22:26.820 --> 03:22:29.060]   It felt right.
[03:22:29.060 --> 03:22:30.420]   When I was little, my mother...
[03:22:30.420 --> 03:22:34.900]   No, but that's exactly what I was saying, is that somehow your body knows without you
[03:22:34.900 --> 03:22:35.620]   knowing.
[03:22:35.620 --> 03:22:38.660]   And today I have zero interest in tomatoes.
[03:22:38.660 --> 03:22:39.060]   Yeah.
[03:22:39.060 --> 03:22:40.100]   Did you eat the tomatoes, though?
[03:22:40.100 --> 03:22:40.580]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:22:40.580 --> 03:22:41.940]   Okay, well, then you probably...
[03:22:41.940 --> 03:22:43.380]   I ate way too many, but that's all right.
[03:22:43.380 --> 03:22:45.940]   Or maybe not enough.
[03:22:45.940 --> 03:22:46.980]   There you go.
[03:22:46.980 --> 03:22:49.300]   So yeah, what you were saying?
[03:22:49.300 --> 03:22:54.020]   Anyway, I think these things shift and change, and there's not a right answer.
[03:22:54.020 --> 03:22:57.620]   And then there's something where it's like one person might do well on something, another
[03:22:57.620 --> 03:22:59.300]   person doesn't.
[03:22:59.300 --> 03:23:01.060]   Or you might do well on something for...
[03:23:01.060 --> 03:23:02.420]   I might...
[03:23:02.420 --> 03:23:07.860]   Maybe if I ate a bunch of liver, I'd feel better because I'm getting vitamins that I
[03:23:07.860 --> 03:23:09.620]   don't... that I'm lacking.
[03:23:09.620 --> 03:23:13.300]   But then once I get them, I'm fine and I don't need that anymore.
[03:23:13.300 --> 03:23:16.260]   And I could potentially get those from other sources or...
[03:23:16.260 --> 03:23:21.540]   But yeah, when I was little, I used to crave...
[03:23:21.540 --> 03:23:23.220]   My mother said I craved...
[03:23:23.220 --> 03:23:28.340]   Not craved, but she said I would always eat sardines, but I wouldn't eat the pieces.
[03:23:28.340 --> 03:23:31.860]   I would only eat the whole ones, which have the bones in them.
[03:23:31.860 --> 03:23:37.540]   And I used to chew on chicken bones and try to eat eggshells when I was little.
[03:23:37.540 --> 03:23:43.220]   So I think all of those things have calcium and other minerals in common.
[03:23:43.220 --> 03:23:44.820]   So there's probably something there that I needed.
[03:23:44.820 --> 03:23:51.700]   Because you'd think as a little kid, I wouldn't be drawn to oily fish and bones and eggshells.
[03:23:51.700 --> 03:23:55.860]   Yeah, it's interesting because you're saying the explanation for the craving is probably
[03:23:55.860 --> 03:23:57.300]   the nutrients you're getting.
[03:23:57.300 --> 03:24:01.620]   But when you're imagining the craving, you're not obviously imagining the nutrients, you're
[03:24:01.620 --> 03:24:04.740]   imagining the texture, the taste, the feel.
[03:24:05.460 --> 03:24:10.180]   A lot of the things that we actually experience as we're eating, that's our brain probably
[03:24:10.180 --> 03:24:11.060]   tricking us.
[03:24:11.060 --> 03:24:12.740]   Right, but do you love tomatoes?
[03:24:12.740 --> 03:24:19.620]   Well, I think we determined that love is impossible to define.
[03:24:19.620 --> 03:24:22.580]   Are you extremely fond of...
[03:24:22.580 --> 03:24:25.140]   Do you think tomatoes are one of the most delicious foods?
[03:24:25.140 --> 03:24:25.700]   No, no.
[03:24:25.700 --> 03:24:26.180]   But maybe...
[03:24:26.180 --> 03:24:27.620]   But yet you crave them.
[03:24:27.620 --> 03:24:32.340]   Maybe it's generational, because it's a big Russian thing with potatoes and tomatoes,
[03:24:32.340 --> 03:24:34.820]   because it's good with vodka.
[03:24:35.540 --> 03:24:36.040]   Salted.
[03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:42.900]   We were talking about the menu in the early days of the restaurant you opened in New York.
[03:24:42.900 --> 03:24:44.260]   So what was on the menu?
[03:24:44.260 --> 03:24:46.740]   What kind of foods were you playing with?
[03:24:46.740 --> 03:24:48.100]   Do you remember...
[03:24:48.100 --> 03:24:53.140]   Was that one of the challenging things, is putting together?
[03:24:53.140 --> 03:24:58.500]   Because you're crafting a new thing in New York, where it's extremely competitive.
[03:24:58.500 --> 03:24:58.980]   Right.
[03:24:58.980 --> 03:25:01.620]   But over time, it got easier and easier.
[03:25:01.620 --> 03:25:04.980]   And then also I wasn't coming up with new dishes.
[03:25:04.980 --> 03:25:06.580]   It was the people that worked there.
[03:25:06.580 --> 03:25:11.380]   So I feel like if I could take credit for something, it would be recognizing talent.
[03:25:11.380 --> 03:25:17.780]   And when dishes were developed, this is when I was there on my own.
[03:25:17.780 --> 03:25:21.140]   So it was opened with Matthew and Jeffrey.
[03:25:21.140 --> 03:25:24.020]   And then within a year, Matthew was out.
[03:25:24.020 --> 03:25:29.460]   And Jeffrey was still involved as the corporate side of it.
[03:25:29.460 --> 03:25:34.980]   But then over time, I separated from that infrastructure as well,
[03:25:34.980 --> 03:25:36.420]   and then was completely on my own.
[03:25:36.420 --> 03:25:41.220]   And in part, I did that because I was growing One Lucky Duck on the side,
[03:25:41.220 --> 03:25:43.060]   and that was growing and growing and growing.
[03:25:43.060 --> 03:25:45.060]   And I knew there was something there.
[03:25:45.060 --> 03:25:48.820]   And yet the two businesses were completely intertwined.
[03:25:48.820 --> 03:25:52.660]   And so potential investors would come at me,
[03:25:52.660 --> 03:25:56.820]   and they would see this very messy situation where I owned One Lucky Duck,
[03:25:56.820 --> 03:26:00.660]   and Jeffrey Chodrow owned the restaurant, and how do we move forward from there?
[03:26:00.660 --> 03:26:05.300]   And then people would say, I should shut down the restaurant and just focus on One Lucky Duck.
[03:26:05.300 --> 03:26:07.780]   And I wanted them all to be together under one umbrella
[03:26:07.780 --> 03:26:11.060]   and to move forward where everybody's incentives were aligned.
[03:26:11.060 --> 03:26:12.980]   And what was the magic?
[03:26:12.980 --> 03:26:15.220]   Why was it so successful so quickly, would you say?
[03:26:15.220 --> 03:26:18.740]   I want to half-jokingly, but not joking,
[03:26:18.740 --> 03:26:22.980]   but sort of say that it was about the love and the food and the space.
[03:26:22.980 --> 03:26:26.500]   Oh, can you define love?
[03:26:26.500 --> 03:26:30.020]   But there was something special.
[03:26:30.020 --> 03:26:32.260]   So when people ask me about opening a restaurant,
[03:26:32.260 --> 03:26:33.940]   I say I don't want to get back into the restaurant business
[03:26:33.940 --> 03:26:36.180]   unless it's the same restaurant in the same space.
[03:26:36.180 --> 03:26:39.780]   Because there was something about that space that felt,
[03:26:39.780 --> 03:26:44.820]   I guess, felt magical, for lack of a better word,
[03:26:44.820 --> 03:26:48.660]   and the energy of a lot of the people there.
[03:26:48.660 --> 03:26:52.740]   And I think that people really cared about it.
[03:26:52.740 --> 03:26:58.180]   And so for whatever reason, there was an energy about the place.
[03:26:58.180 --> 03:26:59.380]   Would you ever do it again?
[03:26:59.380 --> 03:27:00.580]   Yes.
[03:27:00.580 --> 03:27:01.300]   Would you ever consider reopening?
[03:27:01.300 --> 03:27:02.340]   In the same space.
[03:27:02.340 --> 03:27:02.840]   Wow.
[03:27:02.840 --> 03:27:10.500]   That's a tough thing in New York, but you're thinking, okay, well.
[03:27:10.500 --> 03:27:11.460]   It's there.
[03:27:11.460 --> 03:27:11.960]   It's there?
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:16.340]   Let me ask you this question, because I've been searching for that myself,
[03:27:16.340 --> 03:27:20.180]   asking myself this question, the last meal question.
[03:27:21.300 --> 03:27:25.220]   Like, what's the best meal you've ever eaten in your life?
[03:27:25.220 --> 03:27:28.980]   Like, if I had to murder you at the end of this,
[03:27:28.980 --> 03:27:31.620]   and you get one meal, but you can travel anywhere in the world,
[03:27:31.620 --> 03:27:35.220]   what would you eat?
[03:27:35.220 --> 03:27:40.260]   It's one of those questions where I feel like I should have an answer prepared.
[03:27:40.260 --> 03:27:44.420]   No, it's too difficult to sort of pick favorites.
[03:27:44.420 --> 03:27:49.380]   But if somebody would, you know, force you to choose, you'd have to.
[03:27:49.380 --> 03:27:53.780]   I was eating something once, and I had the thought that if I was going to die,
[03:27:53.780 --> 03:27:58.260]   I would come here and order plate after plate of this and eat this.
[03:27:58.260 --> 03:27:59.220]   Do you remember what it was?
[03:27:59.220 --> 03:27:59.460]   Yes.
[03:27:59.460 --> 03:28:01.620]   Some diner in the middle of nowhere?
[03:28:01.620 --> 03:28:05.060]   No, it was Pure Food and Wine was on Irving Place,
[03:28:05.060 --> 03:28:10.420]   and then the kitchen connected to the one Lucky Duck Juice Bar,
[03:28:10.420 --> 03:28:12.020]   which had an entrance on 17th Street.
[03:28:12.020 --> 03:28:15.540]   So it was kind of like this L shape, and then there was a huge garden in the back.
[03:28:15.540 --> 03:28:18.740]   On the corner was Casamano and Bar Jamon.
[03:28:19.540 --> 03:28:24.500]   Um, which was Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich, um, were behind that.
[03:28:24.500 --> 03:28:30.020]   And it was very focused on meat, but also like organ meats and strange, unusual meats.
[03:28:30.020 --> 03:28:31.060]   Spanish restaurant.
[03:28:31.060 --> 03:28:32.660]   Wow, lots of good reviews.
[03:28:32.660 --> 03:28:33.620]   Yeah, it was really good.
[03:28:33.620 --> 03:28:40.980]   This is just a funny that we surrounded it, but Bar Jamon was, um, was this tiny little bar.
[03:28:40.980 --> 03:28:48.580]   And I went in there once with Tobin late, and I don't know why we ended up going there,
[03:28:48.580 --> 03:28:54.340]   but it was right before they closed and drank red wine, and they had tomato bread.
[03:28:54.340 --> 03:29:00.100]   And it's just like a baguette, although it's a Spanish, whatever.
[03:29:00.100 --> 03:29:03.380]   It's like a bread, like a baguette, like a thin that they toast,
[03:29:03.380 --> 03:29:05.460]   and I think they rub it with garlic.
[03:29:05.460 --> 03:29:07.460]   And they don't even put tomato slices on it.
[03:29:07.460 --> 03:29:11.620]   It's like they rub it and the tomato juice is all over it.
[03:29:11.620 --> 03:29:17.620]   It was just bread and tomato juice and probably some garlic flavor and really good salt.
[03:29:18.260 --> 03:29:19.700]   And some wine.
[03:29:19.700 --> 03:29:20.580]   And red wine.
[03:29:20.580 --> 03:29:25.860]   And we sat there and ordered a plate, ate it, ordered another one, ate it, ordered another one.
[03:29:25.860 --> 03:29:27.220]   I think we had like six plates.
[03:29:27.220 --> 03:29:32.180]   And I remember sitting there thinking, I could just eat this until my stomach bursts.
[03:29:32.180 --> 03:29:36.020]   And then, and so if this is like, if somebody was like, what's the last,
[03:29:36.020 --> 03:29:39.780]   I would just want to sit there and eat plate after plate after plate.
[03:29:39.780 --> 03:29:42.900]   If you went back there and ate the same thing, it wouldn't taste nearly as good.
[03:29:42.900 --> 03:29:45.700]   And like, was there something magical about that night?
[03:29:45.700 --> 03:29:50.580]   About the way that bread was made on that night?
[03:29:50.580 --> 03:29:54.340]   The way you felt at that night?
[03:29:54.340 --> 03:29:55.060]   The wine?
[03:29:55.060 --> 03:29:56.820]   The something?
[03:29:56.820 --> 03:30:00.660]   Or do you think, like, where's the power from that food come from?
[03:30:00.660 --> 03:30:01.700]   Is it the food itself?
[03:30:01.700 --> 03:30:03.940]   Or is it the environment?
[03:30:03.940 --> 03:30:05.700]   I'm sure it's both.
[03:30:05.700 --> 03:30:11.060]   But like, if somebody brought a plate of it here right now, it would be completely delicious.
[03:30:11.060 --> 03:30:12.260]   Yeah.
[03:30:12.260 --> 03:30:18.340]   But it might not feel as kind of, not that it felt magical, but it was the whole
[03:30:18.340 --> 03:30:22.340]   warmth of the experience and the red wine.
[03:30:22.340 --> 03:30:25.300]   It's the afternoon in Texas right now, so it's different.
[03:30:25.300 --> 03:30:28.020]   And I keep forgetting and thinking it's late at night.
[03:30:28.020 --> 03:30:33.300]   Yeah, we're surrounded by, this whole place is anti-Huberman.
[03:30:33.300 --> 03:30:34.020]   There's no light.
[03:30:34.020 --> 03:30:39.220]   Well, it's pro-Huberman if it's in the afternoon or the evening,
[03:30:39.220 --> 03:30:41.060]   except for these bright lights.
[03:30:41.780 --> 03:30:45.300]   If they were lower down, if they were like down below,
[03:30:45.300 --> 03:30:47.220]   then they're hitting the tops of our eyes.
[03:30:47.220 --> 03:30:51.860]   But it's the light coming from above that's destructive at night because it's hitting the
[03:30:51.860 --> 03:30:52.660]   bottom of your eyes.
[03:30:52.660 --> 03:30:56.980]   So it's like mimicking the sun, which is signaling your body that it's time to be awake.
[03:30:56.980 --> 03:30:59.300]   So as much as possible.
[03:30:59.300 --> 03:31:00.500]   So I do this in the evenings.
[03:31:00.500 --> 03:31:02.420]   I shut off all the overhead lights.
[03:31:02.420 --> 03:31:04.420]   I try to dim the lights as much as I can.
[03:31:04.420 --> 03:31:07.780]   And I turn on like a lamp versus an overhead light.
[03:31:08.340 --> 03:31:13.780]   Are you also doing the caffeine thing, like not consuming much caffeine way before bed?
[03:31:13.780 --> 03:31:15.220]   Oh, I can't.
[03:31:15.220 --> 03:31:20.260]   Yeah, I usually don't have caffeine late.
[03:31:20.260 --> 03:31:21.300]   I try not to have it.
[03:31:21.300 --> 03:31:22.500]   So ideally-
[03:31:22.500 --> 03:31:24.180]   I drink into the night caffeine.
[03:31:24.180 --> 03:31:25.460]   2 p.m. would be my last.
[03:31:25.460 --> 03:31:30.260]   Ideally, I wouldn't drink coffee after 2, but plenty of times I do.
[03:31:30.260 --> 03:31:34.580]   Especially if I haven't had midday coffee, then I worry I'm going to get a headache.
[03:31:34.580 --> 03:31:36.740]   That makes you way more responsible than me.
[03:31:36.740 --> 03:31:37.860]   Let me return to love.
[03:31:37.860 --> 03:31:44.100]   What do you think makes for a good romantic relationship?
[03:31:44.100 --> 03:31:48.180]   Given your experience.
[03:31:48.180 --> 03:31:53.380]   I mean this question.
[03:31:53.380 --> 03:31:55.860]   I think a mutual respect is a big part of it.
[03:31:55.860 --> 03:31:57.940]   Mutual respect.
[03:31:57.940 --> 03:31:59.940]   That's interesting.
[03:31:59.940 --> 03:32:05.780]   Well, and understanding it in a way that you want what's best for the other person,
[03:32:05.780 --> 03:32:12.500]   not in a way that you would sacrifice yourself for them necessarily, but in a very healthy way.
[03:32:12.500 --> 03:32:17.460]   So I think a healthy relationship is where you want what's best for the other person.
[03:32:17.460 --> 03:32:18.740]   So I always find it tragic.
[03:32:18.740 --> 03:32:28.900]   Like say you started dating somebody who then would get jealous or upset if you spent too
[03:32:28.900 --> 03:32:31.460]   much time working on something, right?
[03:32:32.260 --> 03:32:33.300]   But that's like your life.
[03:32:33.300 --> 03:32:37.940]   So if you're working on some robotics thing and you're having some breakthrough and so
[03:32:37.940 --> 03:32:42.980]   you just want to spend a lot of time wherever you spend a lot of time doing those things,
[03:32:42.980 --> 03:32:47.140]   and then that other person got all bent out of shape and it became like a competition.
[03:32:47.140 --> 03:32:55.780]   That to me seems very unhealthy because if somebody, if it was like a genuine healthy love,
[03:32:55.780 --> 03:33:01.380]   she would want you to be doing those things.
[03:33:02.100 --> 03:33:03.860]   Yeah, that's a good observation.
[03:33:03.860 --> 03:33:13.700]   But to me, I think the way to achieve that is actually, or the easiest way to achieve that,
[03:33:13.700 --> 03:33:19.380]   at least for me, is actually legitimately be excited by the things the other person is excited
[03:33:19.380 --> 03:33:19.880]   by.
[03:33:19.880 --> 03:33:25.860]   So like not in some generic sense, it's good for them to be doing the robotics thing.
[03:33:25.860 --> 03:33:31.700]   Like it's more like you become a fan of all the cool things that they're doing in their life.
[03:33:31.700 --> 03:33:33.700]   So I definitely have this.
[03:33:33.700 --> 03:33:41.540]   Somebody told me recently, there's a term for this, but I love watching other people
[03:33:41.540 --> 03:33:46.820]   succeed, be excited about shit.
[03:33:46.820 --> 03:33:50.260]   I like celebrating other people.
[03:33:50.260 --> 03:33:53.620]   It's fun for me to watch people do the thing they love doing.
[03:33:53.620 --> 03:33:59.540]   So in some sense, that's reinvigorating to me and exciting to me.
[03:33:59.540 --> 03:34:05.620]   And so one of the things for me in a relationship is like, you get excited by watching another
[03:34:05.620 --> 03:34:07.220]   person do the thing they're excited about.
[03:34:07.220 --> 03:34:11.140]   It's not like I intellectually know it's good for them to have their own thing.
[03:34:11.140 --> 03:34:16.500]   It's like I legit get excited by their own thing.
[03:34:16.500 --> 03:34:18.180]   Right, but that's what I mean.
[03:34:18.180 --> 03:34:21.700]   It's like that person would be excited because you're excited.
[03:34:21.700 --> 03:34:28.500]   But they would, I think the easiest way to achieve that is actually be like, what am I trying to say?
[03:34:28.500 --> 03:34:32.660]   It's not like saying that you should be excited.
[03:34:32.660 --> 03:34:34.980]   It's like you can't help yourself but be excited.
[03:34:34.980 --> 03:34:37.620]   Right, but I think that's possible.
[03:34:37.620 --> 03:34:47.220]   But it's possible for that to be the case for somebody that might have an appreciation for
[03:34:47.220 --> 03:34:52.820]   what you're doing, but that's not what that person's going to go spend their time on themselves.
[03:34:52.820 --> 03:34:54.260]   Yeah, if they were by themselves.
[03:34:54.420 --> 03:35:00.020]   So the other person might be really good at a musical instrument that requires a lot of
[03:35:00.020 --> 03:35:03.540]   practice and you're not interested in playing that musical instrument, but you appreciate
[03:35:03.540 --> 03:35:07.220]   the beauty of the music and understand that that person is getting something out of it.
[03:35:07.220 --> 03:35:11.540]   So you would be excited when they get a chance to practice or whatnot.
[03:35:11.540 --> 03:35:13.620]   So it's that kind of a...
[03:35:13.620 --> 03:35:18.180]   Do you think love should be simple or complicated in a relationship?
[03:35:18.180 --> 03:35:21.300]   Well, it might be inherently complicated.
[03:35:22.660 --> 03:35:25.060]   I may have asked Huberman the exact same question.
[03:35:25.060 --> 03:35:27.060]   Forget what he said.
[03:35:27.060 --> 03:35:30.660]   I thought it was interesting when you asked Elon about love.
[03:35:30.660 --> 03:35:32.580]   Oh boy, yeah.
[03:35:32.580 --> 03:35:39.620]   That's going to be conversation number seven, that he actually answers it.
[03:35:39.620 --> 03:35:46.180]   Well, what was interesting that I found admirable was this sort of like a duty to humanity.
[03:35:46.180 --> 03:35:52.260]   I think you asked about it not in about a person, but about the work.
[03:35:52.660 --> 03:35:53.620]   Yeah.
[03:35:53.620 --> 03:36:01.220]   And so it was like to put all this energy to try to kind of like move things forward,
[03:36:01.220 --> 03:36:04.980]   knowing that he will probably die before it gets there.
[03:36:04.980 --> 03:36:10.020]   You're talking about like something related to the science of rocketry.
[03:36:10.020 --> 03:36:11.640]   Yeah.
[03:36:11.640 --> 03:36:14.180]   He's kind of a rocket scientist.
[03:36:14.180 --> 03:36:18.820]   But whatever you were asking him about whether something could be accomplished, and he said yes,
[03:36:18.820 --> 03:36:21.540]   but not in his lifetime, but he's going to keep pushing it forward anyway.
[03:36:21.540 --> 03:36:29.060]   So I felt like that was a really, you know, to put so much of yourself into something just
[03:36:29.060 --> 03:36:35.860]   to kind of move the baton forward for humanity was a struck me as an admirable thing.
[03:36:35.860 --> 03:36:41.540]   You know, there's no great reward in terms of you're going to, you know, you're going to see
[03:36:41.540 --> 03:36:45.700]   that invention happen, or you're going to see Mars colonized or whatever it is.
[03:36:46.660 --> 03:36:51.460]   But you're willing to put in all the work and brainpower to try to push it along.
[03:36:51.460 --> 03:36:57.460]   Like thinking about the biggest possible impact on the world, just thinking about humanity.
[03:36:57.460 --> 03:37:01.140]   I think all of us when we do cool things are contributing to humanity.
[03:37:01.140 --> 03:37:04.260]   And it's good to think of it that way.
[03:37:04.260 --> 03:37:06.820]   When you run a restaurant and you make all the people happy,
[03:37:06.820 --> 03:37:09.780]   I don't know, that's part of that.
[03:37:09.780 --> 03:37:12.500]   It's good to think big like that.
[03:37:12.500 --> 03:37:13.860]   And Elon does definitely.
[03:37:13.860 --> 03:37:19.860]   But when I asked him about love, I'm, you know, just knowing him personally now,
[03:37:19.860 --> 03:37:24.180]   I'm asking about the personal question about love,
[03:37:24.180 --> 03:37:28.820]   but I'm giving him the freedom to escape it, which he always does.
[03:37:28.820 --> 03:37:29.780]   That's very generous.
[03:37:29.780 --> 03:37:32.580]   Because I don't want to trap him.
[03:37:32.580 --> 03:37:34.980]   And I understand it's a difficult.
[03:37:34.980 --> 03:37:39.300]   So, you know, he's better at solving engineering problems than talking about love.
[03:37:39.300 --> 03:37:43.540]   The other thing he's really good at is going to the joke.
[03:37:44.180 --> 03:37:53.140]   So for him, you know, for him, love and all those kinds of things,
[03:37:53.140 --> 03:37:59.060]   especially those kind of cliche sounding things are the stuff of memes.
[03:37:59.060 --> 03:38:02.740]   It's the stuff, the easiest way you can talk about it is humor.
[03:38:02.740 --> 03:38:04.660]   The same with trauma, like personal trauma.
[03:38:04.660 --> 03:38:08.900]   Easiest stuff for him to talk about is the, is laugh about it.
[03:38:08.900 --> 03:38:18.100]   He's been very tough privately or on podcast to talk about personal, like difficult stuff.
[03:38:18.100 --> 03:38:22.180]   And for me, obviously, that's often the most interesting stuff as humans, like,
[03:38:22.180 --> 03:38:23.860]   where's your darkness?
[03:38:23.860 --> 03:38:28.180]   But for him, it's tough.
[03:38:28.180 --> 03:38:30.500]   For a lot of people, it's tough, but it's important to go there.
[03:38:30.500 --> 03:38:34.180]   Maybe first in the privacy of your own mind.
[03:38:35.620 --> 03:38:39.220]   And I think, you know, bringing it back to the relationship thing is wanting to
[03:38:39.220 --> 03:38:45.940]   like understand and accept those things about somebody else.
[03:38:45.940 --> 03:38:48.420]   I mean, it's sort of cliche to say that you can't change somebody.
[03:38:48.420 --> 03:38:55.700]   And you don't want to also like try to change yourself for somebody,
[03:38:55.700 --> 03:38:58.660]   but you can sort of figure things out and be willing to
[03:38:58.660 --> 03:39:04.500]   make adjustments and navigate for the sake of something working.
[03:39:05.460 --> 03:39:11.700]   And sometimes that comes from understanding, which might require a lot of effort and
[03:39:11.700 --> 03:39:15.860]   open-mindedness if somebody is kind of very different from you.
[03:39:15.860 --> 03:39:18.180]   Yeah.
[03:39:18.180 --> 03:39:23.460]   And being fragile yourself, revealing your flaws and getting to learn about theirs
[03:39:23.460 --> 03:39:27.780]   and getting to see the beauty in them, because that's the good stuff.
[03:39:27.780 --> 03:39:33.460]   Or if the flaws are too much of a red flag, then you walk away.
[03:39:33.460 --> 03:39:34.660]   That's the hard stuff.
[03:39:34.660 --> 03:39:39.620]   Either the red flags might be the thing that you actually get to love deeply
[03:39:39.620 --> 03:39:43.460]   because they're a flawed human, or it might be the reason to walk away quickly.
[03:39:43.460 --> 03:39:44.820]   And you don't know.
[03:39:44.820 --> 03:39:46.660]   It's a gamble.
[03:39:46.660 --> 03:39:52.660]   Although if it's a red flag, then it by definition is something that's telling you to walk away.
[03:39:52.660 --> 03:39:56.260]   If it was just like something about their character that's challenging,
[03:39:56.260 --> 03:40:00.580]   you could appreciate that or understand it.
[03:40:01.940 --> 03:40:06.580]   But it's not something that they're intentionally trying to use to deceive you.
[03:40:06.580 --> 03:40:13.300]   I think red flags, I guess it's more about manipulation and/or somebody's
[03:40:13.300 --> 03:40:16.980]   kind of extreme dysfunction or something would be red flags.
[03:40:16.980 --> 03:40:23.780]   But I think there could be things that are quirky or weird or even dark about somebody
[03:40:23.780 --> 03:40:26.500]   that are acceptable.
[03:40:26.500 --> 03:40:28.660]   Yeah, but they might look like red flags.
[03:40:28.660 --> 03:40:29.160]   Right.
[03:40:31.060 --> 03:40:35.300]   If there's someone crying on the subway, that's a red flag for me.
[03:40:35.300 --> 03:40:39.140]   That she might be like an emotional basket game, high maintenance crazy person.
[03:40:39.140 --> 03:40:40.360]   Yeah.
[03:40:40.360 --> 03:40:41.860]   That's true.
[03:40:41.860 --> 03:40:44.740]   But there could be a deeper story to it.
[03:40:44.740 --> 03:40:47.220]   So that's what I'm trying to tell you.
[03:40:47.220 --> 03:40:48.180]   That's true.
[03:40:48.180 --> 03:40:48.680]   All right.
[03:40:48.680 --> 03:40:55.860]   What advice would you give to young folks today if they want to launch a restaurant in New York City
[03:40:55.860 --> 03:40:58.180]   and then message somebody on Twitter?
[03:40:59.380 --> 03:41:02.180]   Before you finished the sentence, I was about to say, "Read a lot of books."
[03:41:02.180 --> 03:41:07.460]   Because you said, "What advice would you give to young people today?"
[03:41:07.460 --> 03:41:09.300]   And I was like, "Read a lot of books."
[03:41:09.300 --> 03:41:11.940]   And then you got to the restaurant part.
[03:41:11.940 --> 03:41:12.440]   Yeah.
[03:41:12.440 --> 03:41:15.300]   No, I mean, I was joking about the restaurants.
[03:41:15.300 --> 03:41:16.660]   Yeah, about life, I would say.
[03:41:16.660 --> 03:41:25.140]   Not just about career as a restaurateur, but just in life, how to be successful,
[03:41:27.060 --> 03:41:30.660]   how to live a life that can be fulfilling, and how to live a life they can be proud of.
[03:41:30.660 --> 03:41:32.120]   I think-
[03:41:32.120 --> 03:41:33.300]   To read a lot of books.
[03:41:33.300 --> 03:41:34.580]   It's complicated because-
[03:41:34.580 --> 03:41:35.860]   Have you figured it out yet?
[03:41:35.860 --> 03:41:36.360]   No.
[03:41:36.360 --> 03:41:39.460]   But I think self-awareness is key.
[03:41:39.460 --> 03:41:45.220]   But I also think there's some of those things where people kind of have to learn their own
[03:41:45.220 --> 03:41:45.720]   lessons.
[03:41:45.720 --> 03:41:53.860]   But I think in part because I never had kids and I never wanted kids, I feel like through my book,
[03:41:53.860 --> 03:42:02.020]   I keep thinking that I want a lot of the lessons that I learned to be useful to other people,
[03:42:02.020 --> 03:42:06.420]   particularly younger people, and in many cases, younger females,
[03:42:06.420 --> 03:42:12.180]   to maybe understand themselves a little better along the way.
[03:42:12.180 --> 03:42:16.580]   Because I think that a lot of mistakes that I made and things that happened,
[03:42:16.580 --> 03:42:18.900]   or things that I did that I'm embarrassed about,
[03:42:21.700 --> 03:42:26.180]   or things that I stepped into that I wouldn't have otherwise stepped into or allowed to happen,
[03:42:26.180 --> 03:42:35.300]   were a result of, in many cases, insecurity, a lack of confidence.
[03:42:35.300 --> 03:42:45.460]   And I think in the context of moving forward with relationships, being really careful to
[03:42:45.460 --> 03:42:49.780]   understand why you're there, or if you're repeating a pattern, that's something that
[03:42:50.500 --> 03:42:57.380]   is sort of cliche, but I feel like it's very, I mean, aren't cliches are things that are true,
[03:42:57.380 --> 03:42:58.820]   they're just repeated a lot.
[03:42:58.820 --> 03:43:03.700]   But anyway, the idea that people repeat patterns, right?
[03:43:03.700 --> 03:43:05.620]   So I think that's very true.
[03:43:05.620 --> 03:43:07.320]   Right.
[03:43:07.320 --> 03:43:12.100]   And so to be aware of that and to figure it out sooner rather than later,
[03:43:12.100 --> 03:43:16.980]   so you don't keep stepping into the same thing over and over again.
[03:43:16.980 --> 03:43:20.820]   You mentioned sort of giving yourself time and space to think.
[03:43:20.820 --> 03:43:24.420]   Yeah, which sometimes isn't possible, but...
[03:43:24.420 --> 03:43:28.020]   Don't let momentum of life sort of carry you away.
[03:43:28.020 --> 03:43:28.740]   Right.
[03:43:28.740 --> 03:43:34.500]   And I think for me, one of the things that would have scared me about having kids is the chaos of
[03:43:34.500 --> 03:43:38.180]   it, or not being able to handle it.
[03:43:38.180 --> 03:43:41.060]   But I think that's just me, not most people.
[03:43:41.060 --> 03:43:43.860]   You ran a restaurant.
[03:43:43.860 --> 03:43:44.360]   I know.
[03:43:45.220 --> 03:43:47.940]   Which is probably why I would go home at night and lie on the floor and cry.
[03:43:47.940 --> 03:43:49.480]   Or...
[03:43:49.480 --> 03:43:50.500]   How often do you do that?
[03:43:50.500 --> 03:43:52.680]   What's...
[03:43:52.680 --> 03:43:54.900]   Do you like a good cry?
[03:43:54.900 --> 03:43:56.280]   I do.
[03:43:56.280 --> 03:44:00.100]   Music usually, or what's...
[03:44:00.100 --> 03:44:01.140]   Can you paint a scene?
[03:44:01.140 --> 03:44:03.300]   And just in general?
[03:44:03.300 --> 03:44:04.660]   Yeah, is there candles?
[03:44:04.660 --> 03:44:06.020]   I cried this morning.
[03:44:06.020 --> 03:44:06.520]   Okay.
[03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:07.620]   Not intentionally and not for long.
[03:44:07.620 --> 03:44:09.300]   Happiness or just overwhelmed?
[03:44:09.300 --> 03:44:10.900]   It was like a...
[03:44:12.980 --> 03:44:16.260]   I looked a little bit at Instagram and saw...
[03:44:16.260 --> 03:44:17.460]   What was it?
[03:44:17.460 --> 03:44:23.220]   Very often they're like these little animal rescue stories or whatever.
[03:44:23.220 --> 03:44:26.260]   But this guy, Matt, who used to be my trainer years ago,
[03:44:26.260 --> 03:44:30.260]   and put this little montage video to music.
[03:44:30.260 --> 03:44:30.900]   That was interesting.
[03:44:30.900 --> 03:44:33.140]   If there hadn't been music, I probably wouldn't have cried.
[03:44:33.140 --> 03:44:36.820]   But it was showing his wife having their second child.
[03:44:36.820 --> 03:44:41.140]   Not showing it, but like the sort of before and then,
[03:44:41.140 --> 03:44:43.460]   you know, the baby in her arms right afterwards,
[03:44:43.460 --> 03:44:44.740]   and then bringing the baby home.
[03:44:44.740 --> 03:44:47.860]   It was this very short little clip, but set to music.
[03:44:47.860 --> 03:44:50.100]   And I watched that and started to cry.
[03:44:50.100 --> 03:44:54.260]   But like, I didn't sob or anything.
[03:44:54.260 --> 03:44:56.580]   So I think I cry easily.
[03:44:56.580 --> 03:45:04.980]   Interestingly, though, in actual horrifically tragic things,
[03:45:04.980 --> 03:45:07.940]   or when they apply to me, I might not cry.
[03:45:07.940 --> 03:45:09.620]   And then people find that unusual.
[03:45:09.700 --> 03:45:12.900]   And that was in the film that, I don't know if it was my sister or my father,
[03:45:12.900 --> 03:45:16.500]   described that when my parents got divorced, I didn't cry.
[03:45:16.500 --> 03:45:18.900]   And I just, whereas my sister bawled her eyes out,
[03:45:18.900 --> 03:45:20.980]   and I didn't cry at all, ever.
[03:45:20.980 --> 03:45:23.700]   And I just didn't say anything or want to talk about it.
[03:45:23.700 --> 03:45:29.860]   And, you know, like when I was sentenced to jail, I didn't cry.
[03:45:29.860 --> 03:45:36.100]   So a lot of times when something really big happens,
[03:45:36.100 --> 03:45:42.020]   I get a little bit weirdly, I don't know.
[03:45:42.020 --> 03:45:43.540]   But I very often--
[03:45:43.540 --> 03:45:46.660]   Too much to feel it all directly.
[03:45:46.660 --> 03:45:49.460]   So you kind of cried out later, slowly.
[03:45:49.460 --> 03:45:52.340]   Right, maybe years later.
[03:45:52.340 --> 03:45:53.380]   Maybe years later.
[03:45:53.380 --> 03:45:53.700]   Yeah.
[03:45:53.700 --> 03:45:55.220]   And maybe that's what I'm really crying about
[03:45:55.220 --> 03:45:57.300]   when I cry at these little videos or something.
[03:45:57.300 --> 03:45:57.940]   I don't know.
[03:45:57.940 --> 03:46:02.580]   But I'm glad for it because I feel like it always feels like kind of a relief.
[03:46:03.460 --> 03:46:06.900]   Well, let me ask this, because it's interesting what you would say.
[03:46:06.900 --> 03:46:13.780]   Do you have regrets about things in your life?
[03:46:13.780 --> 03:46:16.340]   Like, what do you regret?
[03:46:16.340 --> 03:46:22.500]   If there's one day you could live again, which day would you pick?
[03:46:22.500 --> 03:46:25.700]   Like relive and make different choices?
[03:46:25.700 --> 03:46:32.180]   Well, like one obvious thing could be the day that I let
[03:46:32.180 --> 03:46:35.300]   Anthony Strange is in the door if I had instead, you know,
[03:46:35.300 --> 03:46:39.700]   if at any time early on I had instead just pushed him out,
[03:46:39.700 --> 03:46:42.020]   you know, that my life would be wildly different.
[03:46:42.020 --> 03:46:44.500]   It's hard to--
[03:46:44.500 --> 03:46:47.860]   So that's the biggest mistake of your life, you would say,
[03:46:47.860 --> 03:46:52.740]   just letting Anthony into your life?
[03:46:52.740 --> 03:46:56.020]   I think, yes, I think one could argue that's the biggest mistake.
[03:46:56.020 --> 03:46:58.020]   But then at the same time, you never know.
[03:46:58.020 --> 03:47:07.220]   Because like when I was in a sort of a dark relationship that then led to the restaurant,
[03:47:07.220 --> 03:47:09.380]   Am I Having the One Lucky Duck brand?
[03:47:09.380 --> 03:47:12.740]   So I felt like that darkness--
[03:47:12.740 --> 03:47:17.300]   It's like if you married a horribly abusive person, but you had a beautiful child,
[03:47:17.300 --> 03:47:19.540]   and then you go on and you have this beautiful child, and you think,
[03:47:19.540 --> 03:47:21.940]   well, if I hadn't been with that horribly abusive person,
[03:47:21.940 --> 03:47:23.220]   I wouldn't have this beautiful child.
[03:47:23.220 --> 03:47:24.740]   So I wouldn't go undo it.
[03:47:24.740 --> 03:47:26.340]   So I feel like a lot of things are like that.
[03:47:27.300 --> 03:47:32.260]   And I guess I could optimistically hope that there are good things down the road
[03:47:32.260 --> 03:47:37.540]   where I'll think, well, I'm here and I'm grateful for it.
[03:47:37.540 --> 03:47:39.620]   And therefore, I'm grateful for the things that got me here,
[03:47:39.620 --> 03:47:41.540]   which include a lot of dark things.
[03:47:41.540 --> 03:47:44.500]   It's hard to say because a lot of people were hurt in my case.
[03:47:44.500 --> 03:47:48.580]   But I am optimistic that I can make those things up.
[03:47:48.580 --> 03:47:54.100]   And there are also hurts that were, I mean, in some cases, emotionally,
[03:47:54.100 --> 03:47:56.340]   but also very much financial.
[03:47:56.340 --> 03:47:59.220]   And I feel like those are numbers.
[03:47:59.220 --> 03:48:02.500]   And the employees were all paid back.
[03:48:02.500 --> 03:48:06.100]   So anybody else that is out money because of everything that happened
[03:48:06.100 --> 03:48:12.660]   isn't somebody that's not able to feed themselves.
[03:48:12.660 --> 03:48:16.580]   Most of those people have plenty of money, and it's not a big deal.
[03:48:16.580 --> 03:48:18.020]   But I still want to repay all of it.
[03:48:18.020 --> 03:48:20.820]   And it's numbers.
[03:48:20.820 --> 03:48:24.900]   It's not-- nobody died.
[03:48:24.900 --> 03:48:28.260]   And sometimes when I think about my own challenges,
[03:48:28.260 --> 03:48:34.900]   they feel sort of inconsequential in comparison to other things going on in the world.
[03:48:34.900 --> 03:48:42.100]   So, you know, like, yes, it's hard being humiliated,
[03:48:42.100 --> 03:48:47.620]   or it's hard to have people say nasty things about you on Twitter, Instagram.
[03:48:47.620 --> 03:48:48.660]   But really, who cares?
[03:48:48.660 --> 03:48:50.100]   Because that's just words and things.
[03:48:50.100 --> 03:48:55.140]   And I'm not, like, fleeing my home and watching people get shot.
[03:48:55.140 --> 03:48:56.500]   So--
[03:48:56.500 --> 03:48:59.060]   And there's still-- out of this darkness,
[03:48:59.060 --> 03:49:02.020]   out of this, you can still--
[03:49:02.020 --> 03:49:05.620]   that you still have a lot of time to create something beautiful in the world.
[03:49:05.620 --> 03:49:06.420]   Yeah.
[03:49:06.420 --> 03:49:10.020]   Maybe something even more beautiful than you've ever done before.
[03:49:10.020 --> 03:49:11.700]   I am optimistic.
[03:49:11.700 --> 03:49:16.420]   And I also feel like, you know, part of the reason I like having these conversations,
[03:49:16.420 --> 03:49:22.500]   is because I feel like people will learn stuff from my shitty experiences
[03:49:22.500 --> 03:49:25.300]   to avoid going through their own shitty experience.
[03:49:25.300 --> 03:49:29.380]   And I've heard a ton of that from a lot of women and some men,
[03:49:29.380 --> 03:49:34.260]   you know, writing to me saying that they went through something similar
[03:49:34.260 --> 03:49:35.220]   and nobody understood.
[03:49:35.220 --> 03:49:38.340]   And, you know, my story helped them or,
[03:49:38.340 --> 03:49:43.060]   you know, might help them get somebody else out of a situation.
[03:49:43.060 --> 03:49:45.780]   So making it useful feels good.
[03:49:46.580 --> 03:49:49.780]   So through all of this, Leon was with you.
[03:49:49.780 --> 03:49:52.980]   He recently had a birthday.
[03:49:52.980 --> 03:49:54.820]   March, I guess?
[03:49:54.820 --> 03:49:56.180]   Yes, 12.
[03:49:56.180 --> 03:50:00.340]   Yeah, I made him a phenomenal meat cake,
[03:50:00.340 --> 03:50:06.660]   or a layered cake that involved a variety of animal foods.
[03:50:06.660 --> 03:50:07.940]   He's not a vegetarian?
[03:50:07.940 --> 03:50:08.580]   No, he's not.
[03:50:08.580 --> 03:50:09.060]   Okay.
[03:50:09.060 --> 03:50:12.340]   But I also give him, like, really high quality stuff.
[03:50:12.340 --> 03:50:14.820]   But yeah, he's not a vegan or vegetarian.
[03:50:14.820 --> 03:50:16.260]   Let me ask you a hard question.
[03:50:16.260 --> 03:50:22.420]   Do you think about the tragic fact that dogs live much shorter lives than us humans?
[03:50:22.420 --> 03:50:25.860]   Do you think about his mortality?
[03:50:25.860 --> 03:50:27.860]   All the time.
[03:50:27.860 --> 03:50:30.260]   I kind of try not to, but all the time.
[03:50:30.260 --> 03:50:34.340]   Because you told me in traveling here to Austin, Texas,
[03:50:34.340 --> 03:50:40.180]   you're not in the habit of leaving Leon by himself.
[03:50:40.180 --> 03:50:44.500]   Well, he's not by himself, but I know I haven't been away from him
[03:50:45.460 --> 03:50:49.860]   in certainly since before COVID.
[03:50:49.860 --> 03:50:54.100]   So given that...
[03:50:54.100 --> 03:50:55.060]   So I'm not used to it.
[03:50:55.060 --> 03:51:03.780]   And so people always say that dogs have attachment issues or get separation anxiety.
[03:51:03.780 --> 03:51:07.460]   But in my case, at least, it's like, I think he's fine.
[03:51:07.460 --> 03:51:10.660]   I'm the one that is, you know, he's like, fine.
[03:51:10.820 --> 03:51:14.900]   I'm the one that gets anxious about it, being away from him.
[03:51:14.900 --> 03:51:20.020]   You're the one who acts like a dog when you come back and you're super excited to see him.
[03:51:20.020 --> 03:51:21.540]   Yeah, I can't pee on the floor.
[03:51:21.540 --> 03:51:24.980]   Pee on the floor and wiggle your tail and drool and all that kind of stuff.
[03:51:24.980 --> 03:51:29.140]   But do you think about the fact, you know, that you might lose Leon soon?
[03:51:29.140 --> 03:51:30.900]   I do.
[03:51:30.900 --> 03:51:31.780]   I think about it all.
[03:51:31.780 --> 03:51:33.380]   I mean, I try not to think about it, but I...
[03:51:33.380 --> 03:51:34.020]   Are you scared of it?
[03:51:34.020 --> 03:51:34.820]   And I...
[03:51:34.820 --> 03:51:35.620]   Yeah, it's scary.
[03:51:35.620 --> 03:51:38.740]   But then I also just try to understand that it's inevitable.
[03:51:38.740 --> 03:51:49.460]   And I mean, yeah, assuming I'm still around, then that's, I think, one of the things about
[03:51:49.460 --> 03:51:56.820]   having, adopting a dog or caring for an animal, unless it's one of those animals that lives a
[03:51:56.820 --> 03:51:57.540]   really long time.
[03:51:57.540 --> 03:52:02.340]   I just found out that parrots live an extraordinarily long time.
[03:52:02.340 --> 03:52:04.340]   Yeah, but they're annoying.
[03:52:04.340 --> 03:52:06.340]   So you get, it's a trade-off.
[03:52:07.220 --> 03:52:12.420]   The ones we love live a short time, the ones that annoy you live a long time.
[03:52:12.420 --> 03:52:17.540]   So I just think it's one of those things that you just know it's going to happen and it's
[03:52:17.540 --> 03:52:18.420]   just part of life.
[03:52:18.420 --> 03:52:25.140]   And I think it's one of those pains that's, it's painful, but you just kind of have to
[03:52:25.140 --> 03:52:25.700]   go through it.
[03:52:25.700 --> 03:52:28.100]   And what's the alternative?
[03:52:28.100 --> 03:52:28.820]   You're not going to...
[03:52:28.820 --> 03:52:33.220]   It's like saying you would never want to fall in love because of the heartbreak that's going
[03:52:33.220 --> 03:52:34.020]   to inevitably come.
[03:52:34.020 --> 03:52:36.100]   Some people do that.
[03:52:36.100 --> 03:52:37.380]   They just have a way of...
[03:52:37.380 --> 03:52:37.380]   Exactly.
[03:52:37.380 --> 03:52:38.100]   ...ever...
[03:52:38.100 --> 03:52:40.660]   You're saying, "Screw it, I'm diving right in."
[03:52:40.660 --> 03:52:41.060]   Yes.
[03:52:41.060 --> 03:52:42.420]   It was all worth it.
[03:52:42.420 --> 03:52:43.700]   What about your own mortality?
[03:52:43.700 --> 03:52:45.700]   You think about yourself dying?
[03:52:45.700 --> 03:52:47.380]   Less so than I was before.
[03:52:47.380 --> 03:52:55.060]   I think I wrote about that and I put this letter, "Dear Mr. Fox," online, which I never
[03:52:55.060 --> 03:53:00.820]   intended to do, but I did because of all the misconceptions about the film and our relationship.
[03:53:00.820 --> 03:53:05.860]   And so I put this thing up online that I'd written on my phone on multiple.
[03:53:05.860 --> 03:53:06.660]   subway rides.
[03:53:06.660 --> 03:53:12.100]   And at the end of it, I talk about, because especially then when it was the height of
[03:53:12.100 --> 03:53:15.860]   everything was gone and what do I have to live for?
[03:53:15.860 --> 03:53:21.140]   I sort of noticed and wrote about how differently I felt about things, whereas I used to be
[03:53:21.140 --> 03:53:21.620]   afraid.
[03:53:21.620 --> 03:53:27.540]   I used to have a healthy fear of being pushed in front of a train because that happens in
[03:53:27.540 --> 03:53:28.660]   New York or anywhere.
[03:53:29.220 --> 03:53:36.180]   Or I had a healthy fear of, I don't know, walking down a dark street at night.
[03:53:36.180 --> 03:53:42.420]   But I noticed that at the time, I didn't really have those fears because I was like, "What
[03:53:42.420 --> 03:53:43.780]   do I have to lose?
[03:53:43.780 --> 03:53:44.260]   Who cares?
[03:53:44.260 --> 03:53:46.740]   I don't have anything anymore.
[03:53:46.740 --> 03:53:47.860]   What do I have to lose?"
[03:53:47.860 --> 03:53:51.700]   So I certainly feel much less that way.
[03:53:52.260 --> 03:54:02.100]   But something about those feelings lingered where I'm less afraid of it or more just less
[03:54:02.100 --> 03:54:05.060]   afraid of it, but hoping it's not some sort of a gruesome way.
[03:54:05.060 --> 03:54:07.700]   I mean, some people are really afraid of flying.
[03:54:07.700 --> 03:54:11.140]   And I feel like, well, statistically, it's extremely safe.
[03:54:11.140 --> 03:54:12.660]   And if it's going to happen, it's going to happen.
[03:54:12.660 --> 03:54:13.700]   There's nothing you can do.
[03:54:13.700 --> 03:54:20.180]   Like, there's really nothing you can do unless you're going to like do what that guy in that
[03:54:20.180 --> 03:54:23.780]   small plane did the other day and like leap over and was able to take control of the plane.
[03:54:23.780 --> 03:54:25.140]   But I mean, like a commercial flight.
[03:54:25.140 --> 03:54:27.780]   So it's like, if you're going to die, you're going to die.
[03:54:27.780 --> 03:54:28.580]   And it's just your time.
[03:54:28.580 --> 03:54:30.020]   And all you can do is hope that...
[03:54:30.020 --> 03:54:36.020]   I would probably prefer to have as little awareness about it as possible.
[03:54:36.020 --> 03:54:38.580]   You know, it's like, you'd rather have somebody...
[03:54:38.580 --> 03:54:42.740]   If you were going to get shot, you'd rather have somebody shoot you in the back of the
[03:54:42.740 --> 03:54:47.860]   head and you didn't see it coming and just boom, lights out versus somebody holding a
[03:54:47.860 --> 03:54:53.460]   gun to your head, and then you're going to feel all this fear and have to like feel all
[03:54:53.460 --> 03:55:01.700]   of that, which also made me think of animals and animal suffering in the way that some
[03:55:01.700 --> 03:55:10.900]   people argue that because of the conditions and the fear that that's like in their bodies
[03:55:10.900 --> 03:55:13.380]   when they're killed, which is an interesting thing to think about.
[03:55:16.260 --> 03:55:19.540]   Yeah, I clearly struggle with the ethics of...
[03:55:19.540 --> 03:55:35.220]   I just, I think about it a lot about, like our current food system, which involves a
[03:55:35.220 --> 03:55:44.580]   system that everybody has sort of accepted and normalized where, like say aliens did
[03:55:44.580 --> 03:55:52.020]   come down and looked at us and realized that we're a particularly good source of whatever
[03:55:52.020 --> 03:55:52.820]   fuel they need.
[03:55:52.820 --> 03:56:00.340]   So then they imprisoned us all in cages that were like the equivalent of like sardines
[03:56:00.340 --> 03:56:01.700]   and jammed in an elevator.
[03:56:01.700 --> 03:56:10.980]   And then we were bred and we would get sick and we'd go crazy and we'd do the equivalent
[03:56:10.980 --> 03:56:17.860]   of like pecking and then we'd get abused and then like grotesquely and brutally killed.
[03:56:17.860 --> 03:56:19.860]   And that was like our entire lives.
[03:56:19.860 --> 03:56:27.060]   And so if like aliens came down and started and did all of that, we would have to be okay
[03:56:27.060 --> 03:56:35.060]   with that, which is something that was said to me after watching this movie called Our
[03:56:35.060 --> 03:56:36.500]   Daily Bread many years ago.
[03:56:38.020 --> 03:56:44.020]   But it's an interesting way to think about it because, I mean, we would have to be okay
[03:56:44.020 --> 03:56:47.620]   with it because that's kind of what we're doing now, right?
[03:56:47.620 --> 03:56:51.060]   Yeah, we've normalized certain kinds of cruelty.
[03:56:51.060 --> 03:56:55.700]   And I don't, people think, yeah, people think that like I would object to hunting.
[03:56:55.700 --> 03:56:59.140]   Hunting for sport, I think is grotesque.
[03:56:59.140 --> 03:57:06.180]   But if you're hunting and then you're going to eat the entire animal and you're hunting
[03:57:06.180 --> 03:57:12.180]   in a way where it's kind of like, you know, that animal like lived a free and happy life
[03:57:12.180 --> 03:57:17.060]   until that moment in the same way that the animal lived a free and happy moment, lived
[03:57:17.060 --> 03:57:22.660]   a free and happy life, or we don't know, maybe they were depressed, but they lived a free
[03:57:22.660 --> 03:57:26.260]   life until like the lion came and took it down.
[03:57:26.260 --> 03:57:34.900]   So is a human shooting an animal for food somehow more tragic or horrible than a lion
[03:57:34.900 --> 03:57:36.900]   attacking an elk?
[03:57:36.900 --> 03:57:41.780]   Yeah, well, there's a lot of complexities to it on top of all of that.
[03:57:41.780 --> 03:57:47.700]   So one, you said sort of hunting for sport is bad, but there's this like complex ethical
[03:57:47.700 --> 03:57:52.500]   equation of the fact that hunting for sport is the thing that often funds the preservation
[03:57:52.500 --> 03:57:53.300]   of a species.
[03:57:53.300 --> 03:57:56.100]   That's, well, no, that's another complicated layer.
[03:57:56.100 --> 03:58:00.020]   There's like the Maui venison, all the deer in Hawaii.
[03:58:00.820 --> 03:58:12.900]   And I might have gotten Maui venison treats for Leon, but they're hunting those deer is
[03:58:12.900 --> 03:58:14.100]   a way of preserving.
[03:58:14.100 --> 03:58:15.300]   Yeah.
[03:58:15.300 --> 03:58:18.500]   So, I mean, these things are complicated, but that's why I don't have a problem with
[03:58:18.500 --> 03:58:23.700]   somebody shooting an elk or bringing it home and eating it.
[03:58:23.700 --> 03:58:29.300]   Like my, you know, like I've eaten elk jerky and things like that from, that's one of those
[03:58:29.300 --> 03:58:33.780]   situations where like, I wouldn't morally have a problem with it.
[03:58:33.780 --> 03:58:38.340]   And for me, it's also, I'm not one of those people where I think like, "Ew, I wouldn't
[03:58:38.340 --> 03:58:39.220]   eat meat."
[03:58:39.220 --> 03:58:42.980]   It's more like, I don't want to add to the consumption of it.
[03:58:42.980 --> 03:58:49.860]   And I wouldn't want to eat sort of like the factory farmed meat necessarily, unless I'm
[03:58:49.860 --> 03:58:51.540]   in prison and it's otherwise going to get thrown away.
[03:58:51.540 --> 03:58:52.040]   But...
[03:58:52.040 --> 03:58:55.060]   Hashtag.
[03:58:56.820 --> 03:59:01.540]   A lot of things, you know, you may do things differently there, but...
[03:59:01.540 --> 03:59:05.700]   So, you know, it's just, these things are complicated, but...
[03:59:05.700 --> 03:59:08.740]   So, it's not about like, "Ew, I don't want that in my body."
[03:59:08.740 --> 03:59:13.460]   It's sort of like, "Where did it come from and what's going on here?"
[03:59:13.460 --> 03:59:22.100]   And I think that, like, if you just followed Joe Rogan's Instagram, there's sort of a bit
[03:59:22.100 --> 03:59:24.260]   of a glorification of meat that...
[03:59:24.260 --> 03:59:33.140]   Because I listened to enough that I heard the one where he talked, it was a recent one
[03:59:33.140 --> 03:59:35.140]   where he was talking about Anthony Bourdain.
[03:59:35.140 --> 03:59:40.580]   And in that conversation, I think it was that one, he explained that he sort of did it in
[03:59:40.580 --> 03:59:44.900]   summary, so I feel like he talked about it in the past, but did all this research and
[03:59:44.900 --> 03:59:49.540]   came to the conclusion, based on all his research, came to the conclusion that he was either
[03:59:49.540 --> 03:59:55.140]   going to be vegetarian or shoot his own meat and hunt.
[03:59:55.140 --> 03:59:57.620]   And so, that's totally different.
[03:59:57.620 --> 04:00:02.020]   I mean, that's very admirable, I think.
[04:00:02.020 --> 04:00:03.380]   And he has the means to do it.
[04:00:03.380 --> 04:00:04.660]   But if you...
[04:00:04.660 --> 04:00:06.180]   Not only that, he does it with a bow.
[04:00:06.180 --> 04:00:08.260]   Right, even more so.
[04:00:08.260 --> 04:00:09.860]   It is a good question.
[04:00:09.860 --> 04:00:15.780]   It's a good question how we get out of this factory farming of meat.
[04:00:15.780 --> 04:00:21.220]   Right, 'cause I do, I like meat, I think it's delicious.
[04:00:21.220 --> 04:00:28.980]   We're dependent on not just on the nutrients and the taste, we're also dependent on the
[04:00:28.980 --> 04:00:29.380]   cost.
[04:00:29.380 --> 04:00:34.100]   A lot of people have gotten used to a particular kind of cost that they pay for meat.
[04:00:34.100 --> 04:00:40.020]   Right, but I think if you wiped out all the government subsidies, it would be a completely
[04:00:40.020 --> 04:00:43.300]   different story, because why are vegetables so expensive?
[04:00:44.180 --> 04:00:45.620]   And all the subsidies...
[04:00:45.620 --> 04:00:49.060]   Somebody who bought some tomatoes yesterday, I'm protesting.
[04:00:49.060 --> 04:00:50.660]   Why is salad so expensive?
[04:00:50.660 --> 04:00:52.580]   Right, but none of the...
[04:00:52.580 --> 04:01:01.140]   If you look at the subsidies that are given to all the inputs to the meat industry, like
[04:01:01.140 --> 04:01:07.380]   the grain and soy and whatnot, and then to the meat and dairy industries, and all the
[04:01:07.380 --> 04:01:14.260]   subsidies that prop up those industries and allow those products to be cheap and sustainable
[04:01:14.260 --> 04:01:19.780]   from a business perspective, not environmental, it's government subsidies.
[04:01:19.780 --> 04:01:21.140]   So what if we took all that away?
[04:01:21.140 --> 04:01:32.580]   And then also, what if we gave that to the kale and hemp and fresh greens farmers, and
[04:01:32.580 --> 04:01:34.740]   made those foods more affordable?
[04:01:35.300 --> 04:01:38.420]   And then had meat reflect its actual true cost?
[04:01:38.420 --> 04:01:44.820]   Then people would just eat more vegetables and less meat because of the cost.
[04:01:44.820 --> 04:01:48.820]   You mentioned that you crossed off one item from your list.
[04:01:48.820 --> 04:01:50.260]   I forget what the item was, but...
[04:01:50.260 --> 04:01:52.020]   Oh, it was...
[04:01:52.020 --> 04:01:56.340]   I had previously thought that I would want to go to Vegas one day, just to cross that
[04:01:56.340 --> 04:01:56.820]   off my list.
[04:01:56.820 --> 04:02:00.420]   And it's not like I was like, "Oh, one day I want to go to Vegas."
[04:02:00.420 --> 04:02:05.620]   It was just like, I imagined I would only go there once just to see it, and then be
[04:02:05.620 --> 04:02:06.180]   done with it.
[04:02:06.180 --> 04:02:07.060]   Yeah.
[04:02:07.060 --> 04:02:08.260]   Yeah.
[04:02:08.260 --> 04:02:10.500]   That's a good one.
[04:02:10.500 --> 04:02:11.220]   That's a good one.
[04:02:11.220 --> 04:02:15.300]   And I still think you can do it, because there's a particular Vegas experience that's worth
[04:02:15.300 --> 04:02:15.940]   having.
[04:02:15.940 --> 04:02:19.620]   And there's maybe a couple of Vegas experiences that are worth having.
[04:02:19.620 --> 04:02:24.820]   I find casinos horribly depressing, because I think they're just predatory.
[04:02:24.820 --> 04:02:26.100]   Everything about them is predatory.
[04:02:26.100 --> 04:02:29.140]   It's not the casinos that are important, it's the people.
[04:02:29.140 --> 04:02:31.780]   The culture and the whole crazy atmosphere.
[04:02:31.780 --> 04:02:39.300]   The people you meet in the chaos that is Las Vegas can create a memorable experience.
[04:02:39.300 --> 04:02:44.260]   You lose track of what is day, what is night.
[04:02:44.260 --> 04:02:50.340]   You can get drunk and make all the mistakes that somehow create a beautiful masterpiece
[04:02:50.340 --> 04:02:50.980]   at the end of it.
[04:02:50.980 --> 04:02:52.900]   That's for another time.
[04:02:52.900 --> 04:02:54.580]   What else is on the bucket list?
[04:02:54.580 --> 04:02:58.660]   What items on the bucket list you haven't done yet, you really, really would like?
[04:02:58.660 --> 04:03:00.020]   We talked about mortality.
[04:03:00.020 --> 04:03:03.220]   That there's a finite deadline.
[04:03:03.220 --> 04:03:06.580]   What pops in your head as something that you want to still do?
[04:03:06.580 --> 04:03:09.860]   What I want is to not die and owe people money.
[04:03:09.860 --> 04:03:13.380]   So whatever mistakes you make...
[04:03:13.380 --> 04:03:17.060]   I want to live to write those things.
[04:03:17.060 --> 04:03:27.140]   And I also felt really strongly about what I and everybody in the business had built.
[04:03:27.860 --> 04:03:35.940]   And so a big part of me wants to resurrect the brand.
[04:03:35.940 --> 04:03:39.700]   Because I felt really strongly about it.
[04:03:39.700 --> 04:03:46.980]   I had that feeling that this was going to be a thing that I wanted to build and grow
[04:03:46.980 --> 04:03:49.620]   and could have a really positive impact and outlast me.
[04:03:49.620 --> 04:03:53.780]   Would you bring it back as the same name?
[04:03:54.980 --> 04:03:57.460]   Yeah, well, I put the logo on my arm.
[04:03:57.460 --> 04:03:59.540]   That's kind of how strongly I felt about it.
[04:03:59.540 --> 04:04:06.260]   And so when I did that, and around that time and all of that time, I felt really, really
[04:04:06.260 --> 04:04:06.980]   strongly that...
[04:04:06.980 --> 04:04:20.340]   Quietly, because it feels like a little bit bold, but quietly felt really almost with
[04:04:20.340 --> 04:04:24.260]   a certainty that it was going to be something really big and it was growing and growing.
[04:04:25.140 --> 04:04:27.220]   And all signs were pointing towards there.
[04:04:27.220 --> 04:04:32.420]   I was just sort of stalled and couldn't figure out the logistics and then enter Mr. Fox.
[04:04:32.420 --> 04:04:33.800]   So...
[04:04:33.800 --> 04:04:39.940]   The universe can be quite absurdly cruel at times.
[04:04:39.940 --> 04:04:41.620]   But yeah.
[04:04:41.620 --> 04:04:49.380]   But that is something worth reaching for, is repay the debts of the past.
[04:04:50.340 --> 04:04:55.620]   And then people have said to me that Leon achieved some kind of immortality via
[04:04:55.620 --> 04:04:57.940]   being in the documentary.
[04:04:57.940 --> 04:05:04.020]   And then I might, I don't understand this world at all, but I might do like an NFT thing
[04:05:04.020 --> 04:05:11.540]   related to Leon's image, which would be another way of kind of immortalizing his image at least.
[04:05:11.540 --> 04:05:13.080]   Yeah.
[04:05:13.080 --> 04:05:14.260]   But that's a...
[04:05:14.260 --> 04:05:18.260]   I mean, it's a potentially in progress.
[04:05:19.620 --> 04:05:21.860]   Kind of a crazy leap, but...
[04:05:21.860 --> 04:05:24.660]   And potentially relaunching the restaurant.
[04:05:24.660 --> 04:05:27.460]   Possibly, yes.
[04:05:27.460 --> 04:05:33.060]   There's the restaurant and there's one lucky duck in that brand and they're sort of separate,
[04:05:33.060 --> 04:05:33.940]   but related.
[04:05:33.940 --> 04:05:39.220]   And they could each exist independently.
[04:05:39.220 --> 04:05:44.180]   I liked it better when they existed together because I felt like they were very complementary
[04:05:44.180 --> 04:05:46.820]   in a lot of ways and they made sense together.
[04:05:46.820 --> 04:05:49.780]   But either one could be done separately without the other.
[04:05:49.780 --> 04:05:56.660]   Do you think you will find love again, given the chaos yet to go through?
[04:05:56.660 --> 04:06:01.700]   I have, and I never talk about it.
[04:06:01.700 --> 04:06:03.940]   I've never talked about it.
[04:06:03.940 --> 04:06:05.140]   Do you have found love again?
[04:06:05.140 --> 04:06:07.400]   Yes.
[04:06:07.400 --> 04:06:07.940]   Outside of Leon.
[04:06:07.940 --> 04:06:13.780]   But also in a kind of possibly doomed temporary way, which...
[04:06:13.780 --> 04:06:16.340]   You don't like it simple, do you?
[04:06:17.300 --> 04:06:18.580]   It's not that it's not simple.
[04:06:18.580 --> 04:06:20.020]   It's actually quite simple.
[04:06:20.020 --> 04:06:23.300]   It's just that, again, there's a large age gap.
[04:06:23.300 --> 04:06:32.260]   I'm the older one, which in itself isn't a problem because again, I wouldn't want to...
[04:06:32.260 --> 04:06:37.300]   Like if somebody wanted kids in a family, I wouldn't want to hold them back from that.
[04:06:37.300 --> 04:06:43.540]   And so, if I sort of wanted to be with somebody who wanted those things,
[04:06:45.460 --> 04:06:48.180]   even if I was completely in love with somebody, I would have to kind of like,
[04:06:48.180 --> 04:06:57.060]   hurt, endure the pain to be like, "No, I'm going to keep you from those things.
[04:06:57.060 --> 04:06:58.820]   So you should go do those things."
[04:06:58.820 --> 04:07:02.980]   So that's the source of the temporariness?
[04:07:02.980 --> 04:07:04.040]   No.
[04:07:04.040 --> 04:07:15.220]   It's a bit related to logistics and living one place and having extremely different lifestyles.
[04:07:15.620 --> 04:07:16.980]   Is this a prince of some sort?
[04:07:16.980 --> 04:07:18.040]   No.
[04:07:18.040 --> 04:07:19.620]   Does he have a castle?
[04:07:19.620 --> 04:07:23.300]   No.
[04:07:23.300 --> 04:07:24.900]   Okay. All right.
[04:07:24.900 --> 04:07:25.540]   No, no.
[04:07:25.540 --> 04:07:28.340]   Are you going to say who it is or we're going to keep that a mystery?
[04:07:28.340 --> 04:07:35.140]   On the one hand, I feel like it's protective for me to talk about it in some ways.
[04:07:35.140 --> 04:07:44.180]   But I also worry because very often I avoid saying anything because, for a lot of reasons, but
[04:07:44.980 --> 04:07:49.140]   one being that people freak out and just assume that I'm going to step into something horrible
[04:07:49.140 --> 04:07:54.900]   again, because I did step into something horribly destructive again after Mr. Fox.
[04:07:54.900 --> 04:07:59.140]   And what happened was I allowed something to happen.
[04:07:59.140 --> 04:08:02.900]   And so, going back to that, what advice would you give to people?
[04:08:02.900 --> 04:08:09.380]   I would tell people to be very careful, to be deliberate about who they're getting involved with
[04:08:11.220 --> 04:08:15.460]   and thoughtful about it and making sure that they're not just allowing something to happen.
[04:08:15.460 --> 04:08:23.940]   So, it's like men can sometimes be, and I suppose women can be as well, but people can be very
[04:08:23.940 --> 04:08:28.980]   persistent. Sometimes that's a good thing, but it could also be a dangerous thing because sometimes
[04:08:28.980 --> 04:08:32.340]   somebody might just, and this has happened to me a lot, where somebody just wears you down and
[04:08:32.340 --> 04:08:34.660]   you're like, "Ugh, fine." You know?
[04:08:34.660 --> 04:08:38.100]   That's funny.
[04:08:39.540 --> 04:08:44.260]   No, I mean, it's shockingly the things that I've done in the spirit of,
[04:08:44.260 --> 04:08:48.340]   or not wanting to hurt somebody's feelings. That's another dangerous-
[04:08:48.340 --> 04:08:50.180]   Just to be nice. Let's get married just to be nice.
[04:08:50.180 --> 04:08:52.100]   That's another dangerous thing. And also-
[04:08:52.100 --> 04:08:53.460]   Maybe you should stay with Vegas.
[04:08:53.460 --> 04:08:59.300]   I'm circling back to all these unanswered questions from before, but I didn't marry...
[04:08:59.300 --> 04:09:08.260]   He convinced me to marry him in this very quick, annoying way, as if it was something I had to do
[04:09:08.260 --> 04:09:13.540]   and I'd be protected and all kinds of weird reasons. And it was just... My response to
[04:09:13.540 --> 04:09:18.260]   my agreeing to marry him was like, "Ugh, fine."
[04:09:18.260 --> 04:09:24.100]   And then I remember being embarrassed at City Hall, going to get the license.
[04:09:24.100 --> 04:09:32.180]   People who are in love and wanting to get married aren't sitting in City Hall mortified and
[04:09:32.180 --> 04:09:38.180]   embarrassed. So, I cringe when people call him my ex-husband because I've
[04:09:38.180 --> 04:09:42.660]   never thought of him that way. Even though technically that's correct.
[04:09:42.660 --> 04:09:47.220]   Yeah, but there's a powerful romantic notion to the thing and to those words,
[04:09:47.220 --> 04:09:50.180]   and that had nothing to do with you getting married. It was more...
[04:09:50.180 --> 04:09:54.180]   It was just another thing that he made me do.
[04:09:54.180 --> 04:09:55.140]   It's like a chore.
[04:09:55.140 --> 04:10:00.660]   That's just had unfortunate consequences of then having to get divorced and the whole...
[04:10:00.660 --> 04:10:06.020]   Yeah, I think even weddings are romantic. The whole cheesy thing.
[04:10:06.740 --> 04:10:08.900]   Yeah, they are.
[04:10:08.900 --> 04:10:09.460]   Those are cool.
[04:10:09.460 --> 04:10:10.500]   I agree.
[04:10:10.500 --> 04:10:16.660]   We don't get many of those in life. Well, you know what? Let's keep it a mystery.
[04:10:16.660 --> 04:10:26.580]   Let's keep the person a mystery. To be continued on season two on conversations with some...
[04:10:26.580 --> 04:10:30.980]   It's not like a known person or anything, but I feel like people always worry that
[04:10:30.980 --> 04:10:35.460]   I'm stepping back into something and I don't have the energy to be...
[04:10:35.460 --> 04:10:36.420]   Should they be worried?
[04:10:36.420 --> 04:10:37.540]   Defensive and... No.
[04:10:37.540 --> 04:10:40.020]   There you go. Don't worry, friends.
[04:10:40.020 --> 04:10:45.300]   No. And also just... Remember that thing I was saying about how it's good if you
[04:10:45.300 --> 04:10:47.940]   get to know somebody really slowly over a long period of time?
[04:10:47.940 --> 04:10:48.500]   Yeah.
[04:10:48.500 --> 04:10:54.260]   It's one of those situations. So I feel very confident that I'm certain that I'm not stepping
[04:10:54.260 --> 04:10:58.180]   into something where I'm going to be surprised and somebody turns out to be not who they
[04:10:58.180 --> 04:10:59.300]   presented themselves to be.
[04:10:59.300 --> 04:11:01.300]   That's the wise way to do it.
[04:11:02.340 --> 04:11:11.380]   Especially for me. Yeah. And also, again, I would caution people to be careful about
[04:11:11.380 --> 04:11:20.020]   wanting to go into something deliberately versus getting caught up in something or rushed or...
[04:11:20.020 --> 04:11:27.540]   That said, I would suggest people take that cautionary advice, but sometimes you just
[04:11:27.540 --> 04:11:30.660]   fall in love. Love at first sight is a thing.
[04:11:30.660 --> 04:11:36.100]   There are those stories of sweet stories of older people that have been married forever.
[04:11:36.100 --> 04:11:41.940]   They don't have to be sweet. You can get hurt for it too, but don't... Listen to your heart.
[04:11:41.940 --> 04:11:49.300]   This was an incredible conversation. We talked for way over four hours.
[04:11:49.300 --> 04:11:49.860]   We did?
[04:11:49.860 --> 04:11:54.740]   Yeah. And I feel like I can keep talking to you. This was amazing.
[04:11:55.380 --> 04:12:02.660]   Salma, thank you so much for being honest, for being fearless in answering all the questions,
[04:12:02.660 --> 04:12:11.060]   all the difficult questions. And thank you for trying to create something special with
[04:12:11.060 --> 04:12:16.500]   your restaurant and maybe create something special still in your future.
[04:12:16.500 --> 04:12:24.820]   Yeah, I hope so. Thank you for having me. I kept thinking that I was going to get a message that
[04:12:24.820 --> 04:12:31.380]   was like, "Just kidding." I've listened to your podcast a lot, and so I've certainly felt very
[04:12:31.380 --> 04:12:37.700]   intimidated knowing who's sat, if not in this actual chair, in this chair in another location
[04:12:37.700 --> 04:12:40.180]   or maybe here. Very...
[04:12:40.180 --> 04:12:40.820]   Were you nervous?
[04:12:40.820 --> 04:12:42.580]   Yes. And...
[04:12:42.580 --> 04:12:45.540]   Yeah, I was nervous too.
[04:12:45.540 --> 04:12:52.500]   Yeah. But also, because I know the way that you speak and your style, I felt like it was going
[04:12:52.500 --> 04:12:57.380]   to feel like a good natural conversation as opposed to sometimes you have conversations where it's like...
[04:12:57.380 --> 04:12:59.960]   Anyway.
[04:12:59.960 --> 04:13:01.300]   It felt good? You're happy with it?
[04:13:01.300 --> 04:13:05.700]   I didn't feel nervous because of what I was walking into. I felt nervous that I was going to
[04:13:05.700 --> 04:13:10.660]   sound stupid and boring and everybody would be like, "Why did he interview her?"
[04:13:10.660 --> 04:13:14.980]   It was exciting. You happy with it? How did we do?
[04:13:14.980 --> 04:13:19.700]   Yeah, I think so. Very often after...
[04:13:19.700 --> 04:13:21.220]   Are you self-critical after stuff?
[04:13:21.780 --> 04:13:22.580]   Yes. Very.
[04:13:22.580 --> 04:13:26.340]   When you go home tonight, are you going to be happy with yourself or not?
[04:13:26.340 --> 04:13:32.100]   I mean, I feel good. I don't feel like I can't think of anything that I said that I regret.
[04:13:32.100 --> 04:13:36.580]   Maybe there's things that somebody is going to yell at me because I said something that I said,
[04:13:36.580 --> 04:13:41.540]   like, "Meat tastes good," or something. Or I don't... Like this, "Uh-huh," the vegan judgment.
[04:13:41.540 --> 04:13:43.940]   Yes. Yes.
[04:13:43.940 --> 04:13:49.540]   But I think it's more useful to be honest about the contradictions and conflicting feelings,
[04:13:49.540 --> 04:13:53.140]   because I feel like that's what most people have. And so if you want to
[04:13:53.140 --> 04:13:55.780]   help people shift a certain way...
[04:13:55.780 --> 04:14:02.740]   Yeah, you were raw, honest. It was beautiful. It was beautiful to watch. Thank you for the books.
[04:14:02.740 --> 04:14:10.820]   Your darkness today was visible. But the beauty too. It was an amazing conversation.
[04:14:10.820 --> 04:14:16.340]   I'm really, really happy with it. I'm honored that you sit down with me. That was awesome.
[04:14:16.340 --> 04:14:20.740]   I'm floored that you're honored, and I'm honored that you asked me to be here.
[04:14:20.740 --> 04:14:22.820]   Thank you, Sarma.
[04:14:22.820 --> 04:14:29.460]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sarma Malingales. To support this podcast,

[04:14:34.500 --> 04:14:40.820]   playwright August Wilson. "Confront the dark parts of yourself and work to banish them
[04:14:40.820 --> 04:14:45.860]   with illumination and forgiveness. Your willingness to wrestle with your demons
[04:14:45.860 --> 04:14:52.020]   will cause your angels to sing." Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
