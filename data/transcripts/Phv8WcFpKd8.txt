[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians in the 13th chapter and the 5th verse.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   The 5th verse in the 13th chapter of Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Now the apostle here exhorts us to do something which I am quite sure we will all agree is right and good and salutary in every walk and department of life.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It is the custom with mankind in all parts of the world to take stock, especially towards the end of a year like this.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And I say it is something that is recognized as being a good and a sound principle in business or in any walk of life to do this very thing.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Now if this is something that is important in every realm, it is particularly important in the realm of religion.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Because here, after all, we are dealing with the most important thing in life.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We are dealing with something in which the consequences are of a more momentous character than with respect to anything else.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It is a good thing to check your health. There is a great deal to be said for a periodical medical examination, whether you feel ill or not.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   We can't afford to take risks with health. It is a good thing to do so in the realm of business, in your profession, whatever it is.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   But I say of all the realms in which we find ourselves engaged, there is none that is more important than this.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   For here we are looking at something that not only governs our well-being and our happiness while we are in this world of time,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   but we are considering something that will have its value and its importance even when we are no longer in this world and have passed on into eternity.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And therefore I say nothing is more important than that we should from time to time just pause and examine ourselves.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Now there is a sense in which Sunday by Sunday I trust we are doing this.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   If my preaching doesn't cause all of us to examine ourselves every single time, it is very poor preaching.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Preaching which doesn't search us, preaching which doesn't make us ask questions, is not true Christian preaching.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   The business of preaching after all is not simply to display the truth, it is at the same time to apply it.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And however much we may know about these things intellectually and with our understandings,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   if they do not become a part of our lives and if they are not exercising the profoundest influence upon the whole of our behavior and conduct,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   well then our knowledge is of no value.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Our Lord himself said, "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And we all know how easy it is just to go on from day to day without really thinking, without pausing to contemplate and to ponder.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It has always been the difficulty with life in this world.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   We find the psalmists expressing that very thought, we find it in the teaching and in the exhortations.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   But there is no doubt that it is particularly the problem in this present age.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   There was a time when men had no newspapers, they had no books, they had no wireless, they had no television.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   They had not the various things that have come crowding in upon us.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yet even they found it difficult to just sit down and pause and consider and contemplate the point at which they had arrived
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and the progress they were making in the direction of their final goal.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   But today I say it is almost impossible.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And we find day following day, and each one passes so quickly, month succeeds month, and indeed year succeeds year.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   It is almost incredible that a year has gone since we thus considered ourselves in this particular way and fashion a year ago.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   The years are slipping by, and we are thus becoming victims of the whole process of life as it is in this highly organized world.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And I say the greatest danger confronting us all is that we just allow time and circumstances to control us,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   and we are just being carried along by a stream without being quite certain and sure as to what is happening to us and where we are going.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Very well, it is a part of the business of preaching just to call men and women to stop.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And we may have to be violent with ourselves.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It may be that we shall just have to put everything aside and say, "Well, at all costs I must reckon up my position.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I must balance my books. I must know where I stand."
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Now I say that this is the most urgent and vital matter, therefore, that can ever engage our attention.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   So this morning I am concerned not so much to display the truth to you,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   and not so much to exhort you to anything as to put a number of questions to you.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I desire to be unusually practical, more practical than I try to be Sunday by Sunday,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   in order that we all may pay heed to this word of the Apostle,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   in which he calls us to examine ourselves, whether we are in the faith.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   "Prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates."
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   In other words, we are going to talk about ourselves, not about the world situation,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   not about the United Nations organization.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   No, no, something much more difficult.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   How easy it is to be talking about things like that.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That's one of the devil's ways of succeeding in getting us to face this process of self-examination.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And the Church sounds wonderful as she is talking about generalities.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And so many a man may go to hell because he spent his life in being concerned
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   about the Christian attitude towards this and that, and has never considered his attitude towards himself.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Very well. Why is this process of self-examination necessary?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Why is it so essential?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Well, there are many reasons that I can adduce. I'm only going to mention two.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   The first is the one suggested here by the Apostle, that we may not be in the faith after all.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   You see, he's writing to Church members here.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   This isn't a circular letter to the world, it's a letter to the members of the Church at Corinth.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And he says, "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith."
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   "You may not be in the faith," he says.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And I'm asking you to examine yourselves because of this terrible, appalling danger of self-deception.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   It is unfortunately true to say that it is possible for us to take the appearance for the reality,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   and for us to imagine that all is well with us in a spiritual sense when actually everything is all wrong.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Now, this isn't my opinion. This is something which we find repeatedly emphasized in the Bible itself.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Take it in the Sermon on the Mount by our blessed Lord himself.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   "Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not done this and that in thy name?"
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   "And I will profess unto them, I never knew you."
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   "Depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Now, there it is. These are the people, you see, who imagine that they're all right, that they're Christian.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   But he says they're not. They've never been Christian.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   These are the wolves in sheep's clothing. These are the evil trees that thought they were all right.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   It is he himself, therefore, who exerts us to be careful and to make sure and to search our foundations.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   You get it again in the thirteenth chapter of the Gospel according to Zimdub.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   He says, "Strive to enter in at the straight gate."
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Again he says, "Many will say at the time when the master of the house will have got up and shut the door,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   they'll knock at the door and say, 'Open to us.' But he will say to them, 'No, no, I don't know you.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   I have nothing to do with you.'"
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   You get it again, of course, in the parable of the ten virgins, the five wise and the five foolish virgins.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   The whole tragedy of the foolish virgins was that they thought they were all right,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   but they discovered that they were not.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   You get the sixth chapter of Hebrews.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Again there are people who had tasted of the heavenly gift and had many other experiences
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   and obviously thought they were all right, but they never had been regenerate.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   There is not a word to say there that those people were born again.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   They were not regenerate. They had had many things, but they hadn't had the vital thing.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   You get it in the first epistle of John in the second chapter,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   where he talks about certain people that had gone out from amongst us.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   He said, "They were amongst us, but they were never really of us.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   For had they been of us, they no doubt would have continued with us.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   But though," he says, "they were in our midst, they never really belonged to us, and they've gone out."
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   So there were people, you see, who had been members of those early churches.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   They'd been accepted. Everybody thought they were Christians. They thought so.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   But when it came to a certain vital matter, they saw clearly that they were not, and they'd gone out.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   So here, I say, is a very powerful reason for this process of self-examination.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   The Bible is full of warnings against self-deception.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And alas, the history of the Christian church throughout the centuries
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   shows us very plainly and clearly this terrible, this dread possibility.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   But I've got a second reason for this, and this balance is the first one.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   It is important that we should examine ourselves and search ourselves,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   because, you know, it is possible for us to be Christian and not really know it.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Now, that's the exact opposite, isn't it?
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   There are many people who are truly Christian,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   and yet they've never enjoyed being Christians.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   They've never had certainty. They've never had assurance.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And thus they've robbed themselves of the joy of Christian living,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   and of the whole glory and element of praise in this, our Christian work and warfare.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   They are, I say, truly Christian, but because of lack of teaching, perhaps,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   or because of the assaults of the devil.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   They have so concentrated upon certain aspects,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and have so looked into their own souls and its blackness and its darkness,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   that while they have really believed in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   they've never been clear in their understanding that they are truly in him.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   So here is another very important reason for our examining ourselves.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   It may be that some, as the result of the examination, will find peace and joy,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   whereas others will find unhappiness,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   and find themselves in a state of grave concern.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Very well, then, there are all reasons. Let us now proceed to the method.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   How are we to examine ourselves?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Well, I want to emphasize this word "yourselves."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Examine yourselves, says the apostle, whether ye be in the faith.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Now, I draw this kind of distinction.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I suggest that the apostle had it in his mind when he used the word "yourselves."
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   It means, therefore, that we are not only going to examine our belief.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   We are going to do that. At least, I mentioned that hurriedly in passing.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   But the main thrust of this exhortation is not with respect to our beliefs,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   but with respect to ourselves.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Because this is the terrible danger,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   that we may be subscribing to the right beliefs, and yet not be Christian.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   That's why he says, "Examine yourselves."
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Don't be objective only. Be subjective as well.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   "I want you," says the apostle, he was writing, as I say, to church members,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   to people who would never have been admitted into the church,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   unless they had subscribed to the right confession of faith.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And he says to them, "Now then, though you have subscribed,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I want you to examine yourselves."
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And he had very good reason for saying that.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Because some of these people, you notice, had been criticizing him.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   He says in verse 3, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   which to you, Lord, is not weak, but is mighty in you."
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And then in verse 6 again, "But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates."
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   In other words, he had been made a little bit uncertain and unhappy about some of these people,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   by their very reaction to his preaching and to the truth that he presented to them.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   He says, "You are doubting, some of you, as to whether my teaching is right,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   and as to whether I am in the faith, whether I am reprobate or not."
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   He says, "You know, that makes me begin to feel as to whether some of you are in the faith."
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   "Because if you examine yourselves and are truly in the faith,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   well then, you'll have to agree that the preaching that I have given to you is the word of God,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   and you very soon know that I am not reprobate."
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Very well then.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Here then is something that we must emphasize.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   We not only must be sure of our beliefs, the tenets of our faith,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   but we must go beyond that and examine and search ourselves.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Now I think there is a good deal of confusion in the minds of many at this point,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   because they very wrongly apply what is so true of justification to sanctification.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Now, as evangelicals, we hold that a man is justified by faith only,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   and we say very rightly that a man, when he comes to believe,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   must not be concerned about his feelings primarily.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   We say to him, "Look here, whatever your feelings may be, there is the truth of God."
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   That you are a sinner, that Christ has died for your sins.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Now the question is, do you believe that?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   You're not saved by your feelings, you're saved by your faith.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   It's purely objective, it's outside you, and you stand on your faith alone,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   justification by faith only.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Now that's absolutely right.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And unless we are clear about that, of course,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   we shall be in trouble in the whole of our Christian lives.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   We first of all take the prayer word of God, we believe it, we accept it,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   we commit ourselves to it, and we stand upon that alone,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   whatever the devil and every other vice may be suggesting to us.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Yes, that's the beginning.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   But you know, you don't go on like that.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Having started like that, there are then other tests that you must of necessity apply.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Because no man is justified by faith only,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   without at the same time being regenerated, without being born again,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   without becoming a partaker of the divine nature,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   or in the words of John, without a seed of divine life being implanted within him.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Very well.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Because of that, you see, we have to begin to examine ourselves.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   It's no use saying beyond that initial point,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   "Well, now I must never look at myself, I must always look to the Lord,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I mustn't be concerned about my feelings."
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   You must be concerned about your feelings.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Because when we become truly Christian, our feelings are engaged.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And if we have never had any feelings at all, well, then I say,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   "There is serious ground for saying that you've never been a Christian at all."
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   The life of God in the soul leads to certain results, and we must look for them.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   You cannot, the whole of your Christian life, just stand on faith alone.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   That's the entry into it by justification.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   But the moment you're in it and have the divine life,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   well, then I say, the Bible teaches us, as I'm going to show you,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   that we must begin to look for signs of life.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And if they're not there, well, it may well be that we are guilty
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   of what the fathers used to call "fideism," or what we may call today "believism."
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   There are people, you see, who can say the right things and subscribe to the truth,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   but their lives deny it completely.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And listen to this apostle saying that very plainly to these selfsame Corinthians
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   in the first epistle in the sixth chapter.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   "Know ye not," he says, "that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   shall inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   It doesn't matter what you may believe about God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   You may subscribe to the whole orthodox faith.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   But if you're persistently guilty of those things, you are not in the kingdom of God.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   So, you see, the apostle says, examine yourselves.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Don't just say, "Ah, yes, I believe the right things.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   I'm right where others are wrong, and as long as I have the right belief, all is well."
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   It is not well.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   If your right belief is a saving belief,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   it means you've got the life of God in your soul,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   and the life of God in the soul leads to certain specific inevitable results.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   So, we must examine ourselves in a more subjective sense.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Very well, that brings me to the tests.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   What are the tests?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Now, I'm simply going to give you a list of things this morning,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   in order that we may all solemnly examine ourselves on this last Sunday morning.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Before I come to my list, I want to deal with two major difficulties.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I have always found, I still find, and in a sense find it increasingly,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   that many people stumble over two points.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   The first is the place and the importance of experience.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Experience.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Some people come and say something like this.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   They say, "You know, I know many Christian people,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   and they always talk about their experience.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   They say, 'When I wasn't a Christian, so and so,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   then I was converted, ever since.'
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   They say they can put their finger on it, an exact moment, an exact place, an exact point.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   You know," says this person, "I can't say that, and I'm troubled about myself.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   I wonder whether I'm a Christian at all.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   I haven't got this climactic experience.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   I haven't undergone this sudden change, this tremendous decision.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   What is my position?"
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Now, I think this is very important.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   There are many people in my second group, which I mentioned just now,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   because of their trouble over this.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I say there are many who are Christians, but who feel that they're not,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   because they go astray at this point.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   What then is the teaching of the Scripture about this?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Well, it's this, that there is no such thing as a standard type experience.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   There are many ways, from this strict mechanical standpoint,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   in which people enter into the kingdom.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Some have that sudden, dramatic, climactic change to which I referred, but not all.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   If I may use the obvious illustration, as there are many different ways of being born physically,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   and many different things may happen, so it is with our entry into the kingdom of God.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   There is nothing in the Scripture which says that you of necessity
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   have to have that particular type of experience.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And surely, on general principles, children who enter into the kingdom
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   cannot be expected to undergo that dramatic, climactic type of experience.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   There are many who have been brought up in Christian homes and in a Christian atmosphere,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   and they cannot put their finger on any one moment.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   But as I'm hoping to show you, that rarely is not the test.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   The type of experience, therefore, that we have varies tremendously and greatly.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   It isn't the determining factor.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Indeed, I am constrained to go further and to say this,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   that in a sense there is nothing which is more dangerous than just to rely upon an experience.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Because, you know, you can have a great and dramatic and climactic experience in your life
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   and still not be a Christian at all.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   There are people whose lives have been absolutely changed,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and yet I could never call them Christians because they don't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Indeed, they deny him.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   So the mere fact that you were once living that sort of life and are now living this sort of life
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   doesn't prove at all that you're a Christian.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   There are people who say they've seen balls of fire and have had some sort of vision.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   That doesn't prove that you're a Christian.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   The devil can counterfeit experiences.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   So let's be clear, I say, about this next question of experiences.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   This is not the acid test.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   This is not the determining factor.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   It's one of them.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   It's all right as far as it goes, as long as we are careful about it
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   and check it by the things which we are now going to consider.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   The second point, the second particular difficulty is this one.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   The whole question of temptations.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   There are many people who feel that they're not truly Christian
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   because, as they put it, "Surely if I were truly a Christian,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   I wouldn't be having these temptations that I have."
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Evil thoughts and imaginations, evil desires, perhaps even blasphemous thoughts,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   denials, "I'm besieged by them, I'm attacked by them."
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And they sometimes feel that they're not Christians at all.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   They say, "If I were a Christian, surely this would be quite impossible."
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Oh, this is a very important point, and any physician of souls,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   any pastor of people will have met this time without end.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   So let's be clear about this.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   There is all the difference in the world between being tempted to sin
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   and actually sinning.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   There is not a word in the Scripture which says that because you're a Christian,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   you're not going to be tempted.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Indeed, I could prove to you very easily that the Scripture teaches the exact opposite,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   that because you are a Christian, you must expect to be tempted more severely
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   than you ever were before.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   The Lord himself was tempted in a sense that we've never been tempted or never will.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Because he was the Son of God, the devil went to him and said,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   "If thou be the Son of God," and then he opened his batteries upon him.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And he does that to his followers.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And you'll find it as you read the journals and the diaries of some of the greatest saints
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   that they've been attacked in this way.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Well, how can I tell, sir, someone?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Well, you tell in this way.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Do you hate all these thoughts?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Are you wretched because they happen?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Have you got that sense that they're being thrown at you?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Well, if you have, it isn't you, it's the temptation, it's the devil.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   If you feel you'd like to be rid of it all, well, then I say it isn't you, it's the devil.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Because, you see, the man who's not regenerate, the man who's not a Christian,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   he's not aware of all this, and he's not a bit concerned about it.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   He never worries about this.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   He rather likes these things, and he isn't aware that they are temptations even.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   They're the things he desires and wants.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   He doesn't know anything about the conflict.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   So that, I say, is a very simple way in which you can decide.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   If they were your thoughts, you would like them, you'd enjoy them, you'd fondle them.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   But if they are the devil's thoughts suggested to you,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   well, then you'll feel that they're coming upon you,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   and you try to get rid of them, even in a physical sense, perhaps.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And you wish that they ceased, and that you were left alone.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   That is the way whereby, in practice, we can tell the difference between temptation and sin.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   And therefore I say that if your position is that you are being tempted and hard-pressed,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   it may be one of the greatest proofs of all that you are a child of God.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Oh, how many are kept in a state of misery by this, are kept unhappy.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   They say, "But these thoughts, is it conceivable that a Christian should have them?"
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   My dear friend, they're not yours.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   They're the fiery darts of the devil, the wicked one, which is hurling at you.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   They're not your shield of faith.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   They're coming from without, not from within.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   I do trust that if anyone has been besieged and attacked by the devil in that particular way,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   that he or she will see from this moment that it is the devil,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   and will begin to resist him, steadfast in the faith, though he's a roaring lion.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And if you but do so, you will find that you will be given peace and rest.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   I say, well, there are the two difficulties.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   That brings me to the real tests.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   What is the test? Here it is.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   "Know ye not your own selves, O that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobate?"
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Here is the test. Is Jesus Christ in us?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   What does that mean?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Well, it means that he is in us through the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   This is the thing that separates the reprobate from the Christian.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   What do you mean by Jesus Christ being in you, says someone?
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Well, let me put it very simply like this.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   If Jesus Christ is in us, there will be certain signs of life in us, his life in us.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Now, this is a fact.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   You can't be a Christian without Jesus Christ being in you.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   "If any men have not the Spirit of Christ," says this same apostle to the Romans,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   "if any men have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   This is, therefore, the fundamental and the basic thing.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Well, very well, how do I know whether the Spirit of Christ is in me or whether he is not?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Listen to the answers of the Scriptures.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   I'll give you first the negative tests and then the positive.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Look, first of all, at the man who is not a Christian.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Look at the man in whom the Spirit of Christ does not reside.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   What are the facts about him?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Well, this is what we are told about him in the Scripture.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   He is at enmity against God.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   The natural mind is enmity against God.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   That's the first thing.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   The second thing is that he is not subject to the law of God.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   He doesn't like the law of God.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   He doesn't like God.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And, therefore, he doesn't subject himself to the law and to the commandments of God.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Nonetheless, that's the kind of thing that is seen so often in the so-called men of the world.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   There is no thought of God at all in him.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   What else?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Well, this man, of course, finds all the commandments of God grievous.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   He hates them.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   He doesn't like the Ten Commandments.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   He doesn't like that verse that I read just now from 1 Corinthians 6.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   All these commandments of God he hates, he abominates, he finds them grievous.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And the other thing we are told about him is this, that he minds the things of the flesh.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   The word "minds" is a very good one.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   "They that are after the flesh," says Paul, "do mind the things of the flesh."
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   In other words, his interests are entirely bound by this world.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   He's tremendously interested in this world, but he's interested in nothing but this world.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   He minds those things very much, the things of the flesh.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Food, drink, clothing, position, wealth, power, status, success.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Ah, there are the things of the flesh.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And he's interested, tremendously interested, but never does he rise above that level.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   He minds the things of the flesh.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Now, there is the picture given in the Scripture of the man who is obviously not a Christian.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   I'm going to assume that there is nobody in this congregation that fits into that picture.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   That's the obvious worldling.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   That's the obvious non-Christian.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Yes, but alas, as I've said, I can't stop there.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Because, you see, there is the obvious non-Christian.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Yes, but there's this other type that I've referred to, who is also non-Christian,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   but who is not obviously non-Christian, who indeed thinks he is a Christian,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   and who persuades other people perhaps that he is.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   What are the signs of this person?
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Well, here are the signs given again in the Scripture.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   He is a man to whom religion is chiefly a matter of externals.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Not internal, but external.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   His religion is an external something.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   What do you mean, Sir Simon? Well, I'll tell you.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   It may be entirely a matter of church attendance.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   It may mean to him simply that he goes to a place of worship.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Of course, he says, there are people, you know, who never go to a place of worship at all.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   I go Sunday morning, or I go two or three times a year.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Ah, church attendance. He therefore thinks he is Christian.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   It's purely external.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   The main trend of his life is identical with that of the people I've just been describing.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Ah, but he does go to a place of worship, and he thinks that that is to be a religion.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Or it may be that religion is something that gives his social instinct an outlet.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   A hundred years ago, of course, this was very obvious.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And then I imagine it was the main point in self-examination.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   It was the thing to do then to be a Christian, to go to a place of worship.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   It would help you to get a job, a position.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   It would increase your professional status.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   It would help you in your business.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Opportunity for a social outlet.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   And you know, my dear friends, even if things as they are today in the church,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   this is still a possibility.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   There may be people, alas, who even attend church services
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   in order to serve some secret social object they've got themselves.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   They may be looking for friends.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   It may even be that the church is sometimes employed even as a matrimonial agency still.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   And that the thing that brings people, certain young people, to the house of God
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   is just that particular interest.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Can you rule it out?
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   We're examining ourselves this morning.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   What brings us here? Why do we come?
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   What's our real motive?
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   It can be, I say, merely an outlet for the social instinct.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   And there are others to whom their religion is nothing but their own activities, what they do.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   See, there are certain people who are born energetic.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   They must have an outlet for this energy, these activities.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   And the church has often been the sphere in which they've had that very opportunity.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And it's their activity that matters, not the worship of God.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Well, there is one test which we can apply, but let me go on to some others.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   In other words, there are people to whom religion is a matter of duty rather than delight.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   I think that's one of the best tests of all.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Are these things to us a matter of duty?
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Do we have to drag ourselves to the house of God?
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Do we have to force ourselves to sing his praise, to read his word, and to pray to him?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Are these just matters of rigid duty?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Or do we delight in these things?
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Terrible questions, aren't they?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Would to God I hadn't got to ask them.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Or let me put it to you like this.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   This person who appears to be a Christian but who really isn't,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   is always one who controls his religion instead of being controlled by it.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Is that a valid distinction, do you think?
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Do you know what it is to control your religion?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Do you know what it is to be controlled by your religion?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   You know what I mean by saying that some people control their religion?
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Well, it's like this.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You see, they plan out their lives, and first things come first, of course.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   But then they say, "Of course I must have a place for religion in my life.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   I've got my code, I've got my standard. I'm not a worldly man after all."
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   So they give a certain amount of place and of time and of attention to their religion.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   But they're controlling it.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   It has its place, the percentage, the proportion is determined by them.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   And then as if picking up a bag, as it were,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   they take up their religion at certain times and put it down again.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Now I say that anyone who controls his religion like that
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   is surely, according to the Scriptures, not a Christian at all.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Do we control our religion?
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Or let me put it in this way, finally.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   This man who's not really a Christian but who thinks he is,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   is always irritated by truth.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   And disturbed by it and denied by it.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   What I mean is this.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   The moment the Scripture begins to search and to try and to test and to examine him,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   he dislikes it because it condemns him.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   It makes him feel unhappy and ill at ease.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   You see, he'd planned out his religion, just that little place in his life,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   and he's in control and everything is all right.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   But then he begins to hear a message
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   that seems to be attacking him and getting through his defenses.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   And he's made to feel uncomfortable.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   And he may even shuffle on his seat.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And he says, "This is going too far. I'm being attacked. This is being personal."
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   And he resents and rejects it all.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   And thereby he gives himself away.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   You see, that was the very trouble with the Pharisees.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   The Pharisees were the religious leaders and teachers.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   They thought they were all right.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   But every time they listened to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   he convicted them of sin.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And they hated him for it.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   It was the whole basis of their hatred.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   They had no other cause for hating him.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   But it was just that.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   That he made them feel that they were sinners.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   And they couldn't abide it. They couldn't tolerate it.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   This was impossible.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   And he must be got rid of. And they did get rid of him.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   You know, my friends, it's a very serious thing to listen to the preaching of the gospel.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Our response and our reaction to the preaching of the gospel proclaims exactly what we are.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   If we like these general messages about the war and the threat and the future,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   and with some fine literary quotations and so on,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   and balanced, polished phrases,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   and, "Oh, that's marvelous, that's wonderful."
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   But then when you come to these epistles of Paul
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   and these tremendous statements that he makes about the believer and the Christian,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   and you begin to say, "Well, I don't know anything about that.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   That doesn't seem to be true of me."
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   And these questions of the apostle and so on.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   "What is all this?"
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   And thereby I say at once we are betraying our whole position.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Any resentment against the truth and its searching character
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   is an indication that we are not truly Christian.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   In other words, dislike of self-examination is always a very bad sign.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   People who are always living on the surface and who never examine themselves
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   and search and try themselves are virtually stating that they are not truly Christian.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   There are the negatives. Let me end by giving you the positives.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   What are the signs that we really are truly in the faith and belong to Jesus Christ?
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Well, the big thing is this.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Our religion is now internal.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   It's inside.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   It's something that is within.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   "The water that I shall give you," said our Lord to the woman of Samaria,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   "shall be in you, within you, a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And there is nothing more blessed in life, I say, than just this,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   than to know that the thing is inside you.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Whether you've had a climactic, dramatic experience or not, it doesn't really matter at all.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   This is the test. Have you got life? I don't care how you were born.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   I'm interested in this. Are you alive?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   The mechanics of your birth doesn't interest me one second,
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   but I am concerned to know, are you alive?
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   If you are, your religion is in you, a power within you.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   How does it show itself like this?
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   You're concerned about yourself and your own condition.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   You're unhappy about yourself.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Therefore, you do not object to being searched.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Indeed, you rather welcome being searched.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   You sometimes come to a preacher like myself and say,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   "Look here, question me, search me, try me. I want to know.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Don't think you'll hurt me or offend me.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   The thing is so tremendously urgent to me.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Put your questions to me. I want to be examined."
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   That's how the Christian speaks.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   The exact opposite, you see, of the other.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Ah, the Christian is always conscious of his guilt.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   He is conscious of his sin.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Not only is he conscious that he's done things which are sinful,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   but he's aware that his nature is sinful.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   He knows that there's an evil principle in him and he hates it,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   so that he's no longer on the defensive.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And when he reads our Lord's words to the Pharisee,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   he says, "Absolutely right, how true it is."
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   And when he faces these searching questions of Paul,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   he doesn't brush them aside and say, "This is too bad.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   It's becoming personal."
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   He says, "It's absolutely true. Search me and try me, O God,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   and find if there be any wicked way in me."
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   He's no longer on the defensive.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   The true Christian never defends himself.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   "He that is down need fear no fall.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   He that is low, no pride," says John Bunyan.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   You know, the true Christian is troubled by his unbelief.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   He is troubled by the state of his heart and his lack of progress.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   He says, "I've been listening for a whole year.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I don't feel much better than I did a year ago."
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Only the Christian speaks like that.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   The other man is so perfectly satisfied.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   There was no room for progress a year ago, and there still isn't.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   But the Christian sees the possibilities and says,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   "Ah, alas, that I have grown so little and advanced so little."
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   His real desire is to know the truth, and he minds the truth.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   These are the things that he is interested in.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   These are the things that matter.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   His chief desire, his chiefest desire, is to know God and to know the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   He'd give the whole world if he but knew him immediately, directly.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   He'd give everything if he but had that certain testimony of the Spirit with his spirit that he is a child of God.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   It's his greatest longing, his greatest desire.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   He also hungers and thirsts after righteousness, after holiness.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   He says, "Oh, for a heart, to praise my God, a heart from sin set free,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   a heart that always feels the blood so freely shed for me."
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   Religion is his greatest delight, his greatest source of happiness and of joy.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   He loves the brethren. He loves the Word.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   He loves the preaching of the Word.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   He can never have too much of it.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   He doesn't just apportion a certain percentage and say, "That's enough."
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   "I've had once a day on Sunday and so on."
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   "No, no." He says, "I want all I can get."
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   "Time is short and the truth is so great, I can never have enough."
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   That's how he speaks.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   But above all, of course, he is one who feels his own utter helplessness and hopelessness
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   apart from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   but who in the midst of the hopelessness and the helplessness knows that he is enough.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   He feels as unworthy of this great salvation as he did at the beginning,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   but he believes that Christ has died for him.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   So he is humbled, he is humiliated, he mourns on account of his sin,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   but he's got the faith to believe and to know that Christ came into the world
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   not for the righteous but for sinners,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   and that he, vile as he is, is entirely covered by the blood of Christ.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   And it is because of that that he wants to live a life that shall be well-pleasing in his sight
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   and tell forth the wonders of his grace to all others.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   There are the tests.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   Examine yourselves, prove your own selves, whether ye be in the faith.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Have you life? Is it in you?
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   Praise God if it is.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   If it isn't, fly to him.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Ask him to search you still more.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   Ask him to expose you to yourself by his Holy Spirit
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   until you see your vileness and rottenness,
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   and then cast yourself entirely upon the grace of God in Jesus Christ
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   and find forgiveness and new life and all you need.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Amen.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
