[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to another all in podcast. We just got the show
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.080]   notes and I'm ripping them up because the president has the Rona. We knew this was a
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.080]   possibility. We had an incredible docket brewing. But as fate loves irony, we found out on Wednesday
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.780]   night, I believe just in a brief timeline here, Wednesday night, Hope Hicks, his personal
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.920]   assistant got the Rona. And then of course, President Trump announced late last night
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.680]   that he in fact had the Rona and that his wife Melania also had the coronavirus. So with us
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.240]   today to discuss all things tech, politics and coronavirus, David Friedberg, David Sachs and
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.600]   Bestie C, Chamath Palihapitiya are with us. I guess maybe we'll just drop it right to you,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.900]   Friedberg. You are our
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:04.540]   science kid here in the class uh what is when we look at the president's um physique he's
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.520]   clinically obese technically i'm not saying that to be cruel but he's a 74 year old just
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.380]   clinically obese and snorts adderall we don't know that that's just a claim um but seriously
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.860]   what what is the prognosis here and then i my i understand he's now got a experimental treatment
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.580]   was just announced an hour ago uh the taping of this on friday afternoon and of course we wish
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.020]   them all the greatest speedy recovery etc but let's get let's get into the facts here i think
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.080]   the overall mortality rate for um someone of his age is in call it the two to four percent range
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.440]   right and for someone with with you know he's not known to have diabetes or high blood pressure but
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.320]   generally you kind of say there's some risk factors maybe associated um so a couple points
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.840]   but the reality is the treatment that he got was not as good as the treatment that he got
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.480]   is one that's not available to the public and is effectively like creating these uh you know
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.800]   taking these antibodies to the coronavirus and he got eight grams of this immunoglobulin therapy
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.340]   um that is basically a bunch of antibodies that'll eliminate the virus and they're not
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.820]   widely available they're not publicly available these treatments but uh you know based on the
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.820]   early trials and the general experience with using synthetic and you know polyclonal antibodies for
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.220]   uh infectious uh disease like this it's pretty effective and he should kind of uh you know
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.540]   recover pretty quickly i would imagine so so him him dying would basically be a two-outer him
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.980]   getting this special treatment makes it a one-outer if we were talking about this in poker terms
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.940]   uh chamath when you when you look at this turn of events and you saw the news what was your first
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.500]   thought um that it's now basically a hundred percent guaranteed that we will have
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.800]   all the data that we have and we're going to be able to get the data that we need to get the
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.020]   all of the most transparent data about coronavirus um soon so for example you know we we've been in
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.720]   this position where we've been debating hydroxychloroquine we've been debating these
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.000]   um you know all of these different uh regimens um and the reality is the president of the united
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.620]   states if he doesn't get the absolute top-notch care um we're all in some ways fucked so it's
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.780]   it's probably likely that he's going to get the thing that folks know to watch and that's the
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.860]   work and then it'll be hard for everybody else to not want to ask for that and then it's going to be
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.600]   even harder for everybody to then not get some version of it and so i think probably we're going
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.220]   to de-escalate a little bit of mask stuff of testing stuff of you know what the right course
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.640]   of care is and you know frankly i'll be honest with you i hope you know i i wouldn't vote for
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.760]   him but i hope he's well um i don't want anything to happen to the guy um and i hope that we're
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.560]   going to get the thing that he wants to do and i hope that he recovers and it you know he kicks it
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.060]   in the ass and that um whatever he took to get better everybody else can get it too all right
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.420]   sax coming around the horn here talking about the political ramifications of this you were feeling
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.040]   that uh trump was likely to lose uh but here we are with the october surprise and i hate to make
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.520]   this uh handicapping of the election but this certainly is going to have some impact so with
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.480]   your rain man mind and when you go through this deck of cards here what is your brain how do you
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:35.840]   assess this as uh the rain man is this going to be a net positive for his election um results a
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.280]   negative neutral handicap this for us in your mind you must be thinking through this and i and again
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.840]   disclaimers we all want him to get better nobody wishes him out i'm sure some people do but
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.360]   no i'm just saying i'm seeing a lot of uh glee frankly
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.780]   on on twitter yeah a lot of people saying i told you so or karma's a bitch or something like that
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.220]   yeah um you know sort of implying that trump getting this was was a moral failing you know
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.400]   um and uh you know certainly a lot of people are kind of reveling in it um i think he was
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.860]   certainly careless i mean he didn't wear masks he said he didn't like to wear masks so well i mean
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.020]   do you wear a mask inside your house no but if i was in walking around at a
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.040]   a debate or something like that if i was on an airplane with 20 people yeah i would wear a mask
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.920]   i mean you know there were certainly a lot of precautions around the president i mean more than
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.720]   most people i mean any of us could get it from anybody yeah you know um if you know our wife
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.840]   happens to go out to meet a friend for lunch or something like that and then brings it back so
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.040]   there's almost no amount of carefulness you can do to completely avoid this
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.560]   unless you're willing to kind of lock yourself alone somewhere um so i just you know this idea
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.960]   that somehow getting covid is is a moral failing is is what i would take issue with it's not um
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.200]   it's not altogether unlike uh the crazy things that um the religious right was saying in the
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.360]   1980s like you know about aids like when you know jerry falwell said it was god's punishment or
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.520]   something like that trying to imply that the gay plague i mean let's just call it what it is they
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.480]   basically said they they implied somehow that this was um you know some sort of uh just come up and
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.880]   you know or something like that retribution from god retribution exactly exactly and and you know
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.040]   the virus doesn't know who it's infecting obviously it doesn't target sinners or whatever
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.640]   and so i just think that um you know this all this this sort of uh gleeful um sort of blaming
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.360]   that's going around um is is inappropriate and i think it could really backfire if um if trump
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.720]   rapidly gets better i mean if trump is better in say a week um and is hitting the campaign trail
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.680]   again you know what what previously will have appeared to be a moral failing could it could
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.040]   now be argued would be a moral strength since he you know overcame it so easily and um
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.200]   you know so i think that if if he rapidly recovers from this and hits the campaign trail again it's
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.080]   going to make him look strong i think that if he has a hard time with the virus if it's enervating
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.120]   the way that i think it took out boris johnson i mean i've heard british commentators say that
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.720]   boris johnson's just not not even the same doesn't have the same level of
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.680]   energy even now than he did behind before the virus then i would think it could really hurt
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.480]   trump in the last you know this campaign look we i think we all know people um i'm sure you
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.400]   guys do i do who have gone through this and they all say the same thing which is this thing really
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.600]   sucks now there are all these people that say oh it's like dancing on tulips or daffodils
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.920]   i've never encountered a single person like that i see that um i see that maybe on twitter or a
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.120]   friend of a friend but all of my friends who've gotten it they have really struggled through it
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.960]   some of these people are older some of these people are younger some of these people are
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.640]   healthy some of these people are not and consistently they say the same thing which
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.920]   is that there's a couple of days where it literally feels like your chest is being
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:08.720]   uh pounded inside you you can't move you're just in pain and then afterwards the aftermath is you're
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.120]   at you know 50 60 70 of your lung capacity like it does for a couple of weeks i mean doc sands is
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.680]   a friend of ours and he was very public with his experience he tried to avoid it as best he could
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.200]   he got hit with it he got hit hard and he said he felt like he was going to die it was the worst
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   thing he's ever experienced i i have friends that still complain two three four months after the
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.080]   fact that they're at 50 60 of cardiovascular capacity and you know these these people that
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.440]   i that i'm specifically thinking about were really healthy going into coronavirus and so i i don't
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.160]   know i just think it's something none of us want um i don't think you would want to wish this on
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.320]   anybody of course not yeah you know especially if you're a person who's been through this for a long time
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.360]   you know especially frankly the president of the united states has a role um and so i think folks
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:58.000]   just need to sort of like class up here um and hope that we figure out that he a gets the best
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.960]   care and then b we all know what it is and then c that we can get access to it too that's that's
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.080]   honestly i think that's all we should be wishing jamal do you see did you see the letter they
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.120]   published on what he's getting so they did the go ahead and read it go ahead and read it the doctor
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.040]   the doctor published it was not too long ago right jason i saw it on your it just happened like an
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.080]   hour ago i tweeted it yes so he got he got eight grams of polyclonal antibodies this is the
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.600]   regeneron formulation so basically they've isolated the antibodies that neutralize coronavirus that
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.400]   patients have presented in their body and then they use recombinant dna technology to produce
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.440]   those antibodies synthetically so it's a bunch of antibody proteins and then they turn it into an
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.160]   injection into a formula that they can put in your body and you now have effectively neutralizing
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.160]   antibodies so they gave him eight grams which is a pretty high dose and it gets it you know goes in
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.720]   intravenously you can have sometimes an allergic reaction to that but it seems like he was fine
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.920]   from that because they didn't announce an allergic reaction and then uh you know the the antibodies
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.280]   are now in his bloodstream and they bind to the virus so any virus that's floating around
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.280]   immediately gets wiped out it gets eliminated from the body so theoretically this is the way
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.520]   we should treat all infectious disease that's right and i do think that by the way i do and
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.280]   i've written about this i think that is the future of infectious disease i think that's the future of
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.440]   infectious disease is we're all going to get a polyclonal cocktail every year instead of getting
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.840]   a flu shot you get a bunch of antibodies to all the new stuff that's emerging and it wipes everything
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:26.080]   out about this david just think about this there was so much raging debate that got politicized
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.920]   between the left between the right between different folks of people who believed in
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.280]   different things around what the right course of care was there was no single source of truth i'll
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.320]   just say this again when you treat the president of the united states and he gets better that is
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.160]   canonical single source of truth i'm sorry but there can be no debate after that that the smartest
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.840]   people with the access to all of the research i mean let's be clear you don't think a call went
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:59.200]   out last night before they deployed the nuclear warhead stuff to all of the um r d labs and all
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.320]   the big pharma companies and said what do you got and the answer came back at the top of the ticket
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.720]   was this regeneron cocktail yeah they had they definitely had made that call before to prep for
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.440]   this but yeah right totally great yeah i think that's a really good point i think that's a really
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:16.640]   good point totally great now um when you say it highlights what the future of infectious disease
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.680]   treatment is and should be which is that all of us should be getting a booster shot every year
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:28.800]   of synthetically produced antibodies uh that will uh counteract any new infectious disease floating
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.880]   around in the world and we're getting to the point in the next 10 15 years that that should be
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.400]   reality for everyone well yeah it highlights that but it also highlights that in the absence of the
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.560]   most powerful management of the world we're going to be getting a booster shot every year and that's
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:38.560]   going to be a booster shot every year and that's going to be a booster shot every year and that's
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:38.560]   going to be a booster shot every year and that's going to be a booster shot every year and that's going to be
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.920]   going to be a booster shot every year and that's going to be the most powerful man in the world
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   the most powerful man in the world
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.160]   the most powerful man in the world getting the sickness that we're all going
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:42.160]   getting the sickness that we're all going
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   getting the sickness that we're all going to basically and point fingers about
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   to basically and point fingers about
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.680]   to basically and point fingers about what the right solution is and so it
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:45.680]   what the right solution is and so it
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.760]   what the right solution is and so it can't be the case that the next time
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:47.760]   can't be the case that the next time
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.760]   can't be the case that the next time there's a crazy illness that's floating
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:49.760]   there's a crazy illness that's floating
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.080]   there's a crazy illness that's floating around in society we need to go and
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   around in society we need to go and
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.240]   around in society we need to go and target you know five or six of the
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.260]   target you know five or six of the
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.720]   target you know five or six of the leaders of the g8 plus the pope plus
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:56.740]   leaders of the g8 plus the pope plus
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.200]   leaders of the g8 plus the pope plus this plus that beyonce heaven forbid
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.220]   this plus that beyonce heaven forbid
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.360]   this plus that beyonce heaven forbid you know what i mean like this is crazy
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:01.380]   you know what i mean like this is crazy
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.040]   you know what i mean like this is crazy yeah this can't this can't be how we
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:03.060]   yeah this can't this can't be how we
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.680]   yeah this can't this can't be how we find single source of truth yeah well i
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:05.700]   find single source of truth yeah well i
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.080]   find single source of truth yeah well i think if i think politically speaking i
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.100]   think if i think politically speaking i
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.600]   think if i think politically speaking i think there's a lot of upside here for
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:09.620]   think there's a lot of upside here for
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.860]   Trump if he does get better in a week. I mean, if these polyclonal antibodies work,
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.780]   and he emerges from the White House, you know, fit as a fiddle in a week,
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.600]   he's going to say, the cure is here. You know, I was right. We don't even need a vaccine. The
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.840]   cure is here. It's over. And all the I told you so's might flip around.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.680]   How far off would that be from the truth, David?
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:34.180]   Well, if the polyclonal antibodies work, I mean, then it's just a matter of scaling them.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.100]   Can it be scaled, Freberg? Is this easily scalable?
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.860]   Yes. But by the by, I'll just point out the challenge with this is a lot of people
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:49.760]   north of 15% will have because antibodies, remember, they're a protein. And if your
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.140]   cells didn't make that protein, they look like a foreign protein when they show up in your body.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.640]   And so very often, when you get a foreign antibody treatment like this,
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.840]   you will have some sort of allergic reaction because your body will react and attack that
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.040]   protein. And so it's not as simple as just saying, Hey, we should just scale
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   this up. And then you're going to get a lot of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.100]   antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.100]   of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.100]   of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.100]   of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.140]   of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:07.180]   of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:07.200]   of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.220]   of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot of antibodies. And then you're going to get a lot
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.120]   because there's just zero way. Oh, regenerants been running
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.380]   these trials since March 100%? Yeah, 100%. That's right. They
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.380]   what what the I can tell you for sure, when Trump got this
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.980]   treatment, I guarantee they gave him Benadryl, and they gave him
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.700]   a steroid shot and they probably gave him a little bit of
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.000]   cortisone or they had it on the side. Because that's kind of
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.980]   like the standard sort of regimen you would use when you
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.140]   get this sort of, you know, synthesized or, or convalescent
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.200]   plasma type treatment. And, you know, he comes out of this thing
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.460]   on the other end, and he's fine. But but but that treatment
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.280]   regimen is required. So it's, you know, you sit down in an ID
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.700]   booth, and you get a fucking IV and you get shots to go along
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.200]   with it. So it's not as simple as just chipping it out to
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.420]   everyone's home and giving them that treatment, you know,
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.980]   and only Am I correct that only 300 or so people have gotten
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.000]   this to date? Is that correct with the trial? I don't know the
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.680]   answer to that. I know that convalescent plasma, which is
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.300]   called the poor man's version of this treatment, which is
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.020]   instead of synthesizing the antibodies, you're taking the
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.840]   actual antibodies from other people that have had COVID and
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.240]   recovered, you're isolating those antibodies, and you're
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.020]   injecting them in other people's bodies. So that is what
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.640]   convalescent plasma is, it is effectively a soup of all the
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.020]   antibodies from recovered patients. Polyclonal antibodies
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.140]   is the synthesized version of those isolated antibodies where
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.860]   we use fermentation systems and bioengineered cells to make
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.360]   those antibodies, then we isolate them and we and we use
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   there any chance that the president would make a bad
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:54.840]   decision here?
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.740]   Because he would get to dictate his treatment as a powerful
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.880]   person like Steve Jobs did, tragically, I saw a doctor
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.680]   saying this is one of the problems with powerful people is
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.040]   that they actually can, you know, make a bad decision
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.080]   because doctors will let them have too much of a say in is
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.960]   that possible in this situation? You think?
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.880]   I think the answer is no, because they didn't put out a
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.820]   letter saying he got bleach and UV light. So
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:23.340]   he didn't go with his own treatment protocol. And also,
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.180]   you got
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.720]   no, I was just gonna say and also, you know, it eliminated
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.320]   all of the other less nonsensical, but equally sort of
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.380]   question mark treatments. And so you know, I think they went
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.880]   right to the answer, which would only have been really possible
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.680]   if the best docs basically said, this is what we're doing. And I
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.080]   think David mentioned this earlier, that it had been
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.700]   decided well in advance.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.720]   I think that's a good insight. Yeah,
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.160]   there's a there's a protocol that was written down months
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.420]   ago, vetted and revetted probably every week or every
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.480]   month as they get, as they got more data.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.300]   And so the minute it happened, there was nothing to talk about.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.240]   And I suspect that that is probably what happened because
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.880]   there is no way you'd want to be, you know, it's kind of like
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.680]   being a pilot, like, you follow a systematic set of rules to
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.980]   deal with the overwhelming majority of boundary conditions.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.560]   And this seemed like a pretty obvious boundary condition, you
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.900]   would have wanted to have a protocol for well in advance.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.500]   So
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.040]   okay, so I want to just do one handicapping here, Sax, I'll
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.320]   have you take this one off the bat. Because this was the
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.300]   chatter on Twitter. Number one, you know, you're not going to
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.940]   be able to get this one. The first two, I think are just crazy
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.060]   conspiracy theories. He got it on purpose or he's lying, put
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.980]   those aside for a second, you can answer them if you want to.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:36.300]   But the third one is, hey, what happens if he's incapacitated and
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:42.360]   cannot run? Or, God forbid, he died. And so if he's on a
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.860]   ventilator, if he cannot leave the hospital, he's in ICU.
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.080]   It's not even a question.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.380]   It's not even a question, the 25th Amendment deals with that.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.060]   Yeah. Yeah. So it goes to Pence. And if Pence cannot do it for
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.120]   whatever reason, but he's I think he's already...
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.280]   I was actually going to refer to the election, though. What
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.800]   happens to the election if in the next three, four weeks, he's
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.420]   in ICU? What happens then?
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.920]   Oh, that I don't know.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.060]   Well, I would assume it's up to the party to make a change to
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.600]   his ballot if they wanted to. But I think if he's in the ICU,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.720]   he stays on the ballot.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.520]   So we would literally have an election with him on a
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:20.000]   ventilator or him. I mean, if he was unconscious, could he? Can
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.840]   people still go vote for him? I think this is a possibility.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:23.940]   I think these are very low probabilities.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.440]   I think the most likely outcome here is that because he's got the
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:35.580]   best care, it's probably like at least 50% that this is over for him
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.120]   in about a week. And it redounds to his political advantage. I think
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:46.460]   there's probably a 40% chance that he's got more like a three or four
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.540]   week case, which I think would hurt him because he just wouldn't be
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.500]   able to campaign. And then there's maybe like a 5% or 10% chance of
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.400]   something more serious.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.760]   Zach, I wonder if you could talk about the election.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.860]   I wonder if he's got, even if he recovers in a week, the odds are pretty high that he'll have
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:06.660]   a long tail of fatigue, right? And so if he changes his strategy and just does things
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:13.320]   remotely and whatnot, doesn't do rallies anymore, and he doesn't really come out and say he's
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.800]   fatigued, but there's this behavioral change, does that change things, do you think?
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.020]   I think he needs to be able to campaign and hold these rallies. I think that's an essential part of
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.500]   his
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:29.400]   election strategy, but also it's always been his way of going over the heads of the media that hates
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.860]   him and talking directly to people and rallying his base and field testing his ideas. There was
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.600]   that period during lockdowns when he just stopped doing rallies for several months and it really
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:46.980]   felt like he was adrift. So yeah, I think if he can't do rallies, I think that could easily swing
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.900]   the election a couple of points and cause him to lose.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.180]   I think Saxxy Poo is 100% right.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.400]   I was in Indiana last week,
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.740]   and there were a bunch of folks in the neighborhood where I was staying,
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.480]   and I was walking my dog and they were walking their dog, so we were all kind of walking side
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:09.300]   by side and they all were ramping up to go to a Trump rally. They were super excited about this
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.320]   moment to go hear what he has to say. They sounded like they were kind of in this undecided camp,
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.860]   but they wanted to go to the rally to hear what he had to say and kind of experience
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:23.220]   that Trump moment. It was a real kind of ground level, I think, proof point to that.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.580]   Yeah, I think that's a good point for your statement around people really need to feel,
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.960]   and because that's a big part of his kind of MO is that ground level experience.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.600]   It is, and I think it was one of the reasons why no one saw his election coming in 2016,
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:43.080]   is if you turned on the TV and just listened to the commentators, I mean, aside from maybe Fox,
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.540]   it seemed like everyone just hated him. But if you attended the rallies, you would see that he
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.040]   was reaching a lot of people, tens of thousands of people at each event, and he was flying around
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.920]   three events a day, tremendously energetic. So yeah, I think it would hurt him a lot.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.660]   But look, if he's back on the stump a week from now, you're probably going to see all sorts of
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:10.260]   people on the right saying, "I told you so," and "God healed him," and "He must be the chosen one,"
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.580]   or who knows? We could be seeing a Weekend at Bernie's moment here.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:22.860]   Even if he's just tired, they'll prop him up on a big stick and hold him up in front
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.440]   of the crowds and then put him back in the airplane and fly him back home.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.940]   I think we'll know if he's too tired, because he gets up there and he talks for like an hour and a
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.200]   half. An hour and a half? He's done two or three. An hour and a half is short for him.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:42.180]   Yeah. Is it possible we could be talking about Trump having less energy than Biden in a debate,
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.320]   which I think is a good segue here? Are there going to be two more presidential debates? And
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.680]   what was our take on the absolutely embarrassing shit show that we saw on Tuesday night, which was,
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.740]   I think, supposed to be the topic today that we're going to lead off, which was the debate,
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.860]   which seems unimportant now. It feels like a year ago.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.280]   I know. How do you expect us to comment on something that happened so long ago?
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.120]   It was 72 hours ago. I mean, come on, people.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   Oh my God. It feels like years.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:15.060]   2020 is so exhausting. I think I've aged 30 years in one year. It's like three decades.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:20.700]   That debate was just a dumpster fire. The way that I thought about it was-
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.540]   Wrong. Wrong.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.660]   Not true. I mean, imagine-
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.680]   No, no, I agree. It was a disaster for Trump. It was a disaster for Trump.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.780]   Go ahead, Sax. Explain, because he's your boy. Are you now not going to vote for him after that
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.320]   performance?
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.660]   Just to clarify for the audience, I'm not pro-Trump. I'm just anti-
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.620]   Just voting for him.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:46.560]   I'm anti-hysteria. I always support the side that seems least hysterical to me at any given time.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.880]   Did you vote for Trump last election? Yes or no? Or would you be comfortable even saying that?
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.320]   I think you'd be surprised if I told
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.040]   you who I voted for.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.460]   Really?
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:22:01.440]   But okay, so onto the debate. I think both Biden and Trump both had a trap to avoid. I think Biden's
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.900]   trap was appearing senile. I think Trump's trap was appearing unhinged. I would say that Biden
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:13.980]   avoided his trap, and Trump did not. By constantly attacking Biden, interrupting him, it was
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.540]   counterproductive. I mean, what you want to do with Biden was let the man talk. He's a gaffe machine.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.140]   You know, let him talk, let him say things that will get him in trouble. Instead,
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.560]   by constantly interrupting him, Trump kind of let him off the hook.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:32.760]   Now look, I mean, both of their bases, it's like a sporting event. They're just going to
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:38.580]   root for the side they already came to support. But I don't think Trump helped himself with the
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.180]   few percent of independents who are still out there looking to make a decision.
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.980]   I think you're totally right. It was really surprising because if he had
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.960]   just left him to his own devices, you would have let it play out. But I thought Biden, to be honest,
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:57.840]   for some moments, he was fabulous. So I thought he was excellent on race. I thought he was
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.480]   incredible in the moment that he basically stood up to Trump about his son, Hunter, and he looks
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:09.000]   in the camera and he basically says, "Look, I love my son. My son's had troubles and I support." I
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.380]   mean, amazing. And so in those moments, it's so hard to not see that guy as presidential.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.780]   It's easy for Democrats or people that are voting for him like me, but I think if you
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.900]   were a Republican, you got to look at that guy and say, "Man, that is a decent dude."
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.860]   Yeah. I think Biden helped himself a lot. He helped himself a lot.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.360]   He did in certain key moments, he did fabulously well. And in other moments where
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.320]   there were traps, he actually got built up because Trump kept interrupting. And Joe was
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.880]   smart enough to stop talking so that it amplified the sense that Trump was interrupting him.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:49.080]   Trump to me seemed pathetic and scared. He's scared of losing. He felt like a bully who had
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.600]   been laughed at by the whole class. Nobody takes him seriously.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.900]   The moderator, what's his name?
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.860]   Chris Wallace.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:01.140]   Chris Wallace. The moderator was kind of like, "What are you doing, sir? Please." I think Chris
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.280]   Wallace, I mean, I know people were critical of him, but Chris Wallace is like, "Sir, please."
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:12.300]   Just trying to appeal to basic decency and Trump just not getting it made Trump look so bad. It's
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.980]   just, I think, confirmed with people say the demographic he has to win is white women in
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.420]   a lot of these swing states. I mean, I don't think women want to vote. I'm not going to speak for a
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.680]   lot of women here, but my understanding is women don't like guys like that who interrupt constantly
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.320]   and who are belligerent and badgering. And they kind of like a great dad who defended, to your
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:36.000]   point, Chamath, his son and said, "Hey, listen, my son's got problems. My other son died. He's
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.420]   a war hero."
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:43.800]   I really think, and we talked about this a little bit before, but the surface area in
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:50.700]   terms of policy between the Republicans and the Democrats now are virtually non-existent. So look,
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.240]   if you unpack
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:58.140]   foreign policy, they both hate Russia, they both hate China, they both need India,
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:03.180]   and the Middle East is irrelevant because we're moving to a carbon neutral alternative energy
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:09.360]   world. They also don't need Russia as an example. So all of this stuff that used to matter before,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.980]   in so much of the foreign policy that dictate how Americans would fight wars, spend money,
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:20.340]   incite democracy, protect certain leaders, it's all out the window. And they both think about it
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.060]   the same way,
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:25.380]   because the surface area is so similar. That's number one.
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.320]   What about the economy? Because it does seem that they're pretty similar too.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.360]   So number two, economically, they're so similar because they both want to spend trillions of
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.980]   dollars just under a different label. One is sort of under a Green New Deal and the other is called
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:42.960]   an infrastructure bill or whatever it is. And then number three, they will both have the same Federal
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:48.600]   Reserve that is tied to the hip of Treasury who is already committed to be trillions of dollars a
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.880]   year in hock, backing up all the debt. And that's what we're talking about. And that's why we're
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.180]   talking about the debt that basically exists. And so if you put all these things together,
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:59.460]   it's a popularity contest. And this is why I think Joe Biden has an advantage because in a popularity
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:04.500]   contest where you're just picking the figure that you would either have a beer with or feel the most
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.460]   comfortable with, there's an element of this which is like, it's just a decent human being.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:13.740]   It's easier for Biden to get that across than it is for Trump. And when Trump behaves that way,
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:19.860]   it just violates some simple rules of decency. In the debate against Hillary Clinton,
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:29.400]   he didn't act this way. And he was more, it was like watching a show. You were kind of tuning in
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:35.520]   to see what the theatrics would be. Or in the debates in the primaries in 2016 against the
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:42.780]   Republicans, it was theatrical. Here, it was just kind of not, it was pretty sacks.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.980]   In that way, sacks, you think the Democrats put up the right candidate? Because if you did put
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.520]   up Elizabeth Warren, if you did put up a Bernie Sanders, or God forbid, both of them at the
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.740]   same time, it would be a very stark contrast. You would have the socialist ticket that wants
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:02.280]   to ban the billionaires and stop capitalism and kneecap it and spend a bunch of money
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.980]   on redistribution of wealth. And here, Biden doesn't, he's never said redistribution of wealth.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:12.360]   He's never said ban the billionaires. He's pro-capitalism. Feels like a safer bet to
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.680]   the majority of Americans. Did the Democrats actually do a good job putting Biden up there?
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.340]   I think so. I think he is the most,
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.060]   now that we know he's not senile. I mean, I think there was some real question about that going into
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:28.620]   the debate. I think he proved in that debate that he's not. And he's always kind of had the decency
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:35.460]   card that Jamal talks about. Now that we know he's not senile, I think he is the Democrats'
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:41.820]   most electable candidate because he is more centrist than certainly an Elizabeth Warren or
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:47.160]   some of the other candidates that you mentioned. Elizabeth Warren would have moved the election
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.160]   to be about substance. And if this— Yeah.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.680]   In many ways, strategically, no, but think about this. If you basically converge on roughly the
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:02.040]   same strategy with different labels, you make the election one of style. And there are a lot
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:08.340]   of people who really want decency back in the presidency more so than they want anything else,
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:14.400]   because they already come into the election with a level of skepticism that policy, A, won't change
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.980]   that fast, and B, to the extent it changes, doesn't affect them. And so for years, we've been electing
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.840]   people we like. And this is probably the most extreme test of that idea.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.560]   I think there was like— I mean, if you think about that debate, you could probably
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.880]   simplify it down into the audience being part of three camps. They either know who they're voting
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.260]   for, Trump, they know who they're voting for, Biden, and then some folks who are kind of maybe
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:43.140]   they're changeable. And for the folks that are changeable, there's a diversity of objectives.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.920]   Right? There are some folks who care about the decency, some folks who care about policy. But
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.940]   at the end of the day, I think
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.440]   you go into this debate with an expectation of Trump and an expectation of Biden. And I would
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:01.740]   say that Trump was flat to down relative to expectation, and Biden was flat to up. And so
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.340]   that's where I would kind of give the ticker to Biden.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.180]   And sorry, I don't want to interrupt, but I just want to read you this headline,
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:15.060]   "President Trump will be admitted to Walter Reed Medical Center on Friday for a few days."
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.260]   Yeah, I read that.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.620]   Well, hold on a second. That is groundbreaking.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.520]   Well, his doctor said it's because they're out of an abundance of caution. They just want to
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.680]   have him in a place where he can be treated if and as he needs it. That may be a cover story.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.220]   You buy that?
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.200]   I don't buy that. I think he's in trouble.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.080]   I agree with Jason. It is very strange.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:41.640]   When you get a treatment like he got today, you know, eight grams of immunoglobulin therapy like
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:48.780]   that. It sucks. I've had this treatment. I've had immunoglobulin therapy before. And you get
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:55.080]   knocked out. You're on all these steroids. You're on all this anti-allergy stuff. You're a mess for
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.640]   a day or two. And you know, you want to get like IVs and stuff. They give you all sorts of stuff
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.800]   to go with it. I got to imagine that after getting that therapy, he's going to need to be in some
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.340]   degree of care. And I would imagine it's probably better to just do that around doctors and with
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.460]   all the equipment than try and, you know, kind of bring everything into the white house.
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.160]   So, I don't read it as negatively, but…
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.560]   Well, I mean, do you think it could be like an anaphylactic shock?
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.560]   It might be. He might be having some reaction. Yeah, totally.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.800]   Like I said, a large percentage of people that get these antibody therapies have some sort of
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.120]   allergic response. It's all the way from anaphylactic to, hey, I'm having my throat's
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.140]   closing. Hey, I feel I'm getting flushed. I'm getting a fever. There's all sorts of ways that
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.160]   this can kind of present. So…
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.280]   The world is changing so fast that we can't even complete
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.140]   a podcast without it being obsolete.
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.680]   Can I tell you one other thing? What did you guys think about the fact,
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   this is a little morbid, so you can, we can choose not to talk about it, but
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:56.640]   the stock market basically did nothing today on the news that the most important person in
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.200]   the free world, theoretically… I think you just answered your own
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:06.120]   question, Chamath. I can chime in on this one. I don't think that people perceive that Trump is
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.100]   good or bad for the economy either way, and that the economy is separated now from politics,
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.400]   because they think Biden or Trump are going to have the same policies, which you said before.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.660]   They have the same policies, so why does it matter? If Trump were to tragically die,
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.560]   it would not make a difference in the American economy. It's not going to affect people buying
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.940]   iPhones. It might shake people psychologically, but I don't think in a massive way, because he's
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.660]   almost out of office. So I think it's all baked in. That's why the market did do anything. What
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.320]   do you think, Sax? I wanted to disagree slightly with the idea this election doesn't matter.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:40.920]   I think it will matter a lot if the Democrats win the Senate, as well as the president,
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.240]   because then they will have one-party control, and they can pass as much legislation as they want.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:51.360]   And I think a lot of things will get signed, and I think the Biden presidency could be very
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:57.780]   consequential, at least for two years, while all this legislation is passed, even if he's not out
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:05.640]   in front saying very much. I mean, the significance will be in the pen to sign the legislation. If the
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.740]   Republicans hold on to the Senate, but Biden wins the presidency, I agree with you that it's not going
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.880]   to be a tremendously consequential election, because we'll have gridlock and divided government
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:21.300]   again. And so I think a lot hinges on whether Biden wins with or without the Senate.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.260]   I don't disagree with you. The only thing that I will say is that I think that
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:32.940]   Biden will drag the country, especially if it's an up and down Democratic ticket,
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:40.560]   back to the '80s and '90s, more to the sort of the George Baker school of diplomacy and governance.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.720]   And I think that if, and I don't know him to know this, but I think that if he really were
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:53.520]   to have a legacy, I would suspect that part of, again, because he's mentioned that, why did he run?
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.140]   He said the pivotal moment was like Charlottesville and Trump's reaction to Charlottesville. I think
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:04.020]   Biden is really moored by this concept of decency. And I think that if he were there and he thought
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.500]   to himself, I'm going to be here for four years because that's the right responsible thing to do,
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:13.080]   but no more, I don't think that you're going to see a bunch of crazy legislation pass. I think
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:18.360]   Biden's going to say, guys, this is what I expect to do. By the way, did you, and I think I would
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:23.040]   bet on that because of what he said at the beginning of the debate. He's like, I am the
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.120]   Democratic party. I don't know if you guys remember that. I do remember that.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:32.700]   That was incredible. That was so powerful. That was a very Darth Sidious emperor move
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:37.320]   when he said, I am the Republic. No, no, no. I think he was trying to basically say like firewall
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:44.340]   the far left or the far left, the socialist left and say that rhetoric is not what I was elected
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:50.340]   on. I was elected on my platform. I am the party. This is what I believe and everybody
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.660]   else will have to toe the line. And by the way, in the end, that's not such a bad thing.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.000]   Yeah. It's a man.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.920]   I agree. I think that that was a really important moment for him is for him to say, look, I'm in
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.060]   charge here because the Republicans have been making the argument that he's a Trojan horse for
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.140]   all these, like,
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.220]   far left elements.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.000]   AOC.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.980]   AOC. And so it was very important for him to come forward and say, no, I'm the one leading
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:19.740]   this ticket. Now, that being said, and I think it would be a great thing for the country if Biden
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:25.740]   brought the Democratic party back to more of a, you know, Bill Clinton to, you know, Obama type
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:31.800]   centrism or, you know, center leftism, I guess you could say, as opposed to this sort of like crazy,
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.540]   you know, woke Marxism or Maoism, whatever you want to call it.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:36.960]   Yep.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.940]   But I'm, I'm very skeptical that he will, because I think Biden has always positioned himself
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:47.580]   throughout his career as being at the center of the Democratic party. And I think he moves as the
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.240]   Democratic party moves. I agree. He's not going to be all the way to the left of the Democratic party,
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:57.780]   but those left elements will drag his sort of center to further to the left and we'll end up
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.820]   with sort of a, a compromise. And I think at the end of the day, if the Democrats win Congress,
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.500]   he'll sign whatever they, they pass.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.780]   Hmm. I'm, I'm not so sure.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.960]   I really, I really, I'm not so sure.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:17.760]   The, the White House is, uh, not that far away. It looks like it's a 30 minute drive
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:25.920]   from Walter Reed sending a helicopter. Is that normal? Because he drove there last time.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.820]   Would that be indicative of this as an emergency type situation,
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.880]   sending Marine one as opposed to just driving there for 20 minutes?
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.600]   I think they get, look, they'd be, there'd be a lot of liability if he had an actual medical
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.960]   emergency and they were just like, yeah, we're going to send him for a few days out of an
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:45.060]   abundance of caution. The fact that they said out of an abundance of caution, I think if there is
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:50.100]   an emergency, you, you can't get away with saying that. Oh, you can for sure. They would lie.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:55.560]   I don't know. It'll come out later. Trump administration was above lying about situation.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.060]   If he's unconscious, they got to swear Penson. Yeah. There's a lot of reasons why you got to
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:06.420]   be careful. I'm not saying he's unconscious. I'm just saying it's not even unconscious. Like, I'm just thinking,
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.840]   I'll add here is sending a helicopter for a 20 minute ride than a motorcade.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:15.240]   Like seems a little, I mean, I would take a, I would take a helicopter to the 7 11. If I had a
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:25.560]   helicopter, you're taking a helicopter down to the poker game. Okay. Uh, let's,
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.840]   this is, I think a good jumping off point to an interesting discussion that blew up on Twitter
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:36.240]   earlier this week, which is we can't keep up with all the politics, the, the rhetoric,
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:43.380]   the vitriol and this polarization. So, uh, Coinbase co-founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong wrote a letter
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:50.040]   saying, Hey, listen, if you, uh, want to talk about politics, that's fine. Not at my company
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.480]   anymore. We're going to have a no politics rule, no debating the stuff. And we're going to be
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:01.380]   ultra ultra focus focused. I'm sorry at work. Um, and you can check your politics at the door.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.060]   When you read this SAC, you've come out in support of Brian Armstrong. Uh, what was
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:11.940]   your take on his position about leave your politics at the door when you get to work?
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:16.380]   Right. Well, I think, I think what Brian, so I, I did, I did compliment it,
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:22.020]   um, his, his manifesto. And I, I think, uh, are you an investor? I, I am, I'm a small investor
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:29.640]   in Coinbase. Um, and, uh, and, and I'm friendly with, with Brian. And so I, I certainly, you know,
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:35.400]   like the idea of, of defending him against unfair attacks, but, um, I also genuinely like the
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:40.260]   manifesto. Um, and I think, you know, his argument kind of boils down to, to three components. I
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:47.340]   think number one, that having these debates on every issue, whatever the issue du jour is pulls
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:52.560]   the company's focus away from its core mission, which he really emphasized. And, um, you know,
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.780]   that mission mission is challenging enough in its own right. Um, second, he was saying that,
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:02.220]   and this is something I've said before as well, which is just that politics is just
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.220]   increasingly divisive in our society. It's just inherently divisive.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:10.440]   And therefore it's, it's, uh, corrosive to team cohesion. And the more you have of that in your
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:16.440]   company, the worse it is for, you know, the team. And I think the third thing he, he, he mentioned,
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:22.020]   which I thought was really interesting is that the freewheeling debate of, or discussion of politics,
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:27.060]   you know, like, like that we're having here, but we kind of have our own little safe zone here. It
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:33.300]   risks, uh, hurt feelings or misunderstandings that can become HR issues because people can then
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.040]   complain about it. They feel unsafe.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.940]   They feel unsafe and they report to. And so that's a further distraction.
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.000]   I felt unsafe at moments in this podcast. I'll be honest. There was a couple of moments.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.900]   Well, I think, well, I think one of the reasons why this pod sort of works is because we're all,
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:50.460]   we're all friends and, uh, we've created a safe space for us to have these conversations,
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:54.300]   but the workplace is very different. It's not, you know, and, and, and what I read
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:39:00.660]   Brian trying to do is to reimpose a true safe space by saying, leave your politics at the door.
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:04.380]   Now, I think he's been deliberately misconstrued.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:04.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:10.080]   By, by critics who want to say that, well, you have to leave your conscience at the door. You
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.660]   know, that's not true. He's not saying that you can't have your own political views or contribute
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:20.940]   to causes that you like, but you just do gotta do it on your own time. Kind of like Mr. Hand
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:26.400]   said in fast times at Ridgemont high, you know, like do that on your own time. Um, and I, and,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.480]   and that makes sense to me.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:34.680]   I think like, I mean, look, I think about this from the point of view of one of the employees working
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:40.560]   at one of these companies that doesn't want to be a party to the debate. Um, if I'm an engineer at
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:46.620]   Google or Coinbase, I go into work and I am captive, right? I don't have the option of not
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:51.600]   showing up to work. If I go to a rally, I have the option of saying, I'm going to go to this rally
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.500]   and walk away. Cause I don't like the speaker or I'm going to go to the rally. Cause I want
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.980]   to participate in this dialogue or this debate. I can't do that at work.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:04.500]   So it's unfair for work, which is a place that I, as an employee have to go to every day.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:10.620]   To be a forum for people to express themselves on political points that I may or may not agree
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:15.360]   with, but more importantly, may or may not want to actually be a party to the discussion around.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.580]   Um, and I think that's the most important thing to note here is like, it's not about enabling the
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:25.680]   free speech of the employees that want to debate. It's about the protecting the workspace for the
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.940]   employees that don't want to debate and don't want to be exposed to that. Um, and that's really
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:30.180]   important.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.320]   As a Chamath, as a person of color who, um, you know,
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.960]   have, I'm sure some sh has some shrunk feelings about what we've seen in terms of police shootings
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:45.240]   or maybe in your own personal life experience facing racism, uh, again, as a person of color,
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:51.900]   what are your thoughts on the workplace? Is it, is it possible for you to leave that at the door?
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:58.140]   That was the criticism. I think I saw from the, you know, people who were supportive of BLM and
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:04.140]   they said the background here was they were trying to get Brian to explicitly say black
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:11.340]   lives matter and to, you know, have the company rally behind that. Um, and that he didn't, he,
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.420]   he didn't want to have that be part of the work environment and that he was offering people four
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.720]   to six months severance if they would leave, if they don't like the new rules. So what are your
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:18.840]   thoughts?
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:26.460]   I think that this whole thing became a quagmire unnecessarily. I think that he showed,
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:33.960]   um, a lot of naivety, um, and frankly, like, um, you know,
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:40.080]   a little bit of stupidity really. Um, it was really poorly written. Um, and that's why it's
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:45.240]   been so misunderstood and misconstrued in my opinion. I think a lot of what he had to say
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:51.300]   was valid, but when it was so poorly presented and you know, the, the essay was like eight minutes
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:56.040]   and it was rambling and the mission was like, you know, 97% down on the, you know, in the,
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.080]   it's just like, it was a convoluted fucking mess.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:03.780]   So if I had to do it again, if I were him or if I was his advisor and he had asked me, you know, to
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:09.360]   proofread the essay, what I would have said is more of the following, which is our mission,
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:13.740]   which is, you know, I think to create financial Liberty or something, something like that,
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:20.220]   you guys can find out what it is for the whole world is unbelievably important. We will talk
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:25.980]   about every issue through the lens of achieving our mission. And we will be disciplined about
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:30.960]   saying which things matter and which things don't. So for example, if somebody says, listen,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.600]   I really believe in spaying and neutering dogs,
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.860]   the right answer shouldn't be, Hey, shut the fuck up. It says, okay.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:46.440]   How does that allow us to maximize our users? How does that allow us to achieve our mission? Why does
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:52.680]   it allow us to achieve our mission? And if you ask the question, why four or five times in a
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.580]   very first principles way, you'll get to the answer. So I would have rather said, we are
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:03.180]   going to train people how to understand what builds up to our mission and what is otherwise
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:09.240]   something that you should leave at home. And in that context, there are a lot of things actually
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.680]   that are political that need to be brought, especially into a company like Coinbase,
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:19.620]   which is working in crypto, which is all about eliminating the financial barriers of people that
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:26.160]   don't have access to it. Like you are trying to dismantle an extremely exclusionary part of the
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:33.240]   economy. And so there are potentially many movements that matter. And those movements in
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:38.100]   countries in which you will want to gain users may look like political movements.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.580]   Well, and that was Jack Dorsey's point. He came out.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:47.520]   Yeah. So I just think it was kind of a too superficial. It was very Silicon Valley-esque
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:54.660]   reaction. It was emotional. It was a little insecure. And to me, it missed the mark because
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:44:03.060]   there was a lot of validity in what he was saying, but presented in a lens of Silicon Valley bullshit.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:10.740]   And it was not well thought through. So if he had rewritten it and he had said 99% of what he said,
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:17.700]   but through the lens of why we're going to think about a first principles way of defining how
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:22.620]   everything ladders into the mission, he will train his employees. Instead, what he created
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:27.600]   was a schism and a decision point. And I'm not sure that that's how you maximize value in 2020
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:32.880]   as a CEO, because at the end of the day, you have to deal with an entire population cohort that
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.860]   is that are in their twenties, early thirties, teenagers that will eventually want to work for
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:42.180]   you. And whether we like it or not, they're different. And one of the things you need to
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:46.500]   do if you're going to run an enormous company is understand the psychology of your employees,
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:53.100]   understand the psychology of how movements and decisions are organized, and then play to win.
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:58.560]   And it's no different than anybody else. If you want to be in the job, to be the starting point
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.700]   guard for the warriors, you got to know how to fucking pass the ball. And if you're going to
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.420]   be the power forward, you have to know how to do a certain set of things that are different than that.
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:11.220]   And so I would sort of have framed it there because I think there was a lot of goodness
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:15.660]   in what he said, but presented in a pretty shitty manner. I think it's good. He brought up the topic.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.760]   I do think there's a tactical issue here and he, he could have laid out the ground rules for,
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:26.520]   I think to your point, Chamath of how we should talk about, uh, politics at work and what are
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:32.520]   the ground rules. I think the number one issue here, which people don't talk about is that slack
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:39.900]   and email and forums inside of companies have created a massive distraction. And when somebody
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.500]   goes into the random channel, which is built into slack, and I know this is in the weeds,
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:49.560]   but I have seen this happen at multiple companies. Now, slack infects a company. Somebody creates a
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:56.820]   room about a topic, whether it's Trump or police violence or immigration, whatever it is. And then
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:02.340]   people want to sound off on that. And now you've got an electronic form where people are talking,
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:06.540]   talking about highly charged issues that makes people feel unsafe. And so what I told my companies
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:11.460]   was, um, the two companies I run, you could talk about politics. If you want to go for a walk with
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:15.660]   somebody and have coffee or lunch, and you want to have a two hour discussion about it, go for it.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:21.120]   Please do not put this in electronic form because it's a massive distraction. Uh, and there'll be a
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.160]   record that could create downstream human resources issues to your report sex. I have a suggestion,
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:31.020]   and this is an organizational design experiment, and maybe somebody listening will implement it.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:31.440]   Their company.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.020]   Okay.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:39.280]   Allow 100% free form debate about anything. One condition. You literally need to have a soapbox
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:45.940]   and like in the 1880s Hyde park in London. Yep. You put the soapbox someplace in a safe space
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:50.560]   where you can go and you can talk and people who want to listen will listen and people who need to
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.400]   work can work and people who don't want to listen, don't have to be forced to listen.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.480]   What's the digital version of that, that you're suggesting?
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.400]   No, not saying a literal room in the campus.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.840]   No, a literal place in your office.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.740]   You put the soap, you have a soapbox, you grab it, you put it down the ground,
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:11.440]   you stand on it and you say it. And if you're not willing to do that, then, you know, it's okay.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.900]   Are you saying that there's no digital version of that?
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:20.020]   Because people could, what I'm saying is that two things. One is the digital version is actually
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:25.960]   training people to ask why, why does it matter? Now, the reason why it's important to ask that
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:31.660]   is because somebody may say, I'll use Jason's example that he loves. We need to support the
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:37.300]   Uyghurs in China. The best way to do that is to proliferate our software in the following way,
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:42.160]   because it will free them from enslavement of the Chinese and it'll give them access to financial
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:49.360]   independence. Wow. I mean, okay, that seems to be paying off the mission. So if you would, if so,
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:55.360]   you got to give freedom for people to come up with these ideas, because it may the first version of
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:00.460]   this idea may, may not actually be what the final version is. And the final version may be the killer
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:07.540]   feature. So I, on the digital forum in the slacks, it should be why respect. It's a very respectful
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:11.980]   question. It shouldn't, it should not be in any digital forum because it leads to chaos because
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.880]   we see that on Twitter and what's happening is the Twitter derangement that we all suffer from
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:21.400]   is now infected inside the communication system that runs the operating system of the company.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.740]   Go ahead. Yeah, that's exactly right. Yes, I do. I do agree with Jake on this one. So,
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.280]   so look, I mean, Chamath is right that I'm sure I'm sure Chamath would have written a
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:34.780]   better letter, but I think we understand the gist of what Brian was trying to say. And actually,
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:39.460]   I thought it took a lot of courage to, to write it. And what he's basically saying is that politics
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:45.580]   has become so divisive in our society that the, I mean, it'd be nice if we could have these reasonable
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:50.080]   debates the way that we're having this discussion inside companies, we didn't have to have these
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.720]   artificial restrictions, but we do, we have to, you know, it's the same reason, you know, that we
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.140]   have the separation of church and state is because people couldn't stop killing each other over
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:03.700]   religious wars. And so finally we had, you know, the treaty of Westphalia to stop it. And what
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:09.040]   Brian's basically proposing is a, is a treaty for the workplace because we cannot get along around
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:14.980]   politics. But David, he is the CEO of an $8 billion company. Could he not have hired somebody to edit
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:21.100]   that essay? Okay. Well, I mean, look, I, I just, to me, like if it's meaning, if it's seriously well
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:26.500]   thought through and it, and if it was as important as Westphalia, you would probably have a couple
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:32.200]   of proofreaders corporate version. Okay. It's not, it's not historically polished for sure. Here is
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.980]   Jack Dorsey's response. I don't have you guys respond to it. I think it's in your wheelhouse
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:42.460]   in terms of what you said, Chamath Bitcoin, AKA crypto is direct activism against an unverifiable
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:47.680]   and exclusionary financial system, which definitely affects so much of our society important to at
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:52.840]   least acknowledge and connect the related societal issues. Your customers face daily.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.440]   This leaves people behind. I think he's right. You have,
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.700]   you have to view this problem, not through the lens of your own emotions, not even through the
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.660]   lens of the frustrations of your employees. You have to help shift the discussion to say,
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:11.080]   why does this achieve our mission? And just constantly in a thoughtful, respectful way,
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:17.140]   ask why, and by the fourth or fifth, why it will either be something that doesn't matter
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:22.900]   and you can dismiss it quickly or something that actually is rooted in fact, and probably is
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:26.380]   something you need to pay attention to. And maybe the way that the conversation
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:31.300]   started was probably not with the right language that people given the chance would have framed it
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:37.000]   differently. Okay. The worst take, uh, according to the internet's, uh, Twitter's ability to ratio
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.920]   people, which is when you get more comments than likes, um, which is not normally how it works.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:46.780]   People are actually taking the time to explain to you how bad your take was as opposed to liking it
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:52.960]   is what a ratio is. If you don't know, um, goes to Dick Costolo, um, who's a friend of ours, uh,
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.720]   me first capitalists who think
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:01.360]   you can separate society from business are going to be the first people lined up against the wall
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:08.980]   and shot in the revolution. I'll be ha I mean, and that's, that's enough to get you ratioed and
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:13.720]   have this thing go supernova. I mean, Mike Cernovich is retweeting this and losing like
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:19.540]   his mind over it. You know, that the former CEO of Twitter is inciting violence. He's a comedian
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:24.820]   as well. Um, to Costolo. So I think he's joking here and, but he adds the punk, the exclamation
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:25.060]   point.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:25.300]   Okay.
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:25.660]   Okay.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:25.700]   Okay.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.680]   Okay. I'll happily provide video commentary.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:36.800]   Here's here's here's my, uh, disagreement with, with Dick and, and with Jack is ultimately the
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:42.680]   societal value of a company doesn't come from whatever platitudes or political statements it's
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:48.260]   CEO makes, but rather from the quality of its products and the impact of its products. And in
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:55.640]   that sense, Dick and Jack are living in a glass house. I mean, Twitter is a sewer of political,
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:03.140]   diatribe and polemical hate. I don't know anyone who feels better after spending time on Twitter.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:07.660]   If Facebook is like cigarettes, I don't know what Twitter is.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.500]   Fentanyl?
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:14.920]   Fentanyl or something, yeah. So ultimately, maybe Jack should spend his time figuring out
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:22.320]   how to make Twitter into a less socially divisive product because just issuing
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.720]   woke platitudes is not going to do it.
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:30.300]   I agree with that. I don't think platitudes does it. All I'm saying is you have to view it through
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:36.000]   the lens of, I want to become the most relevant company possible and achieve the most impact.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.780]   And I think that there are a lot of times where some of these issues, when presented politically,
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:48.520]   underlying it is actually some feature or some capability or some way of seeing the problem that
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:53.720]   unlocks more demand that can help you win. And not knowing a priori what the answers to those
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.160]   questions are, that's not going to help you win.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:59.920]   It's important to train people on a framework versus say you can't talk because I guarantee
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:04.560]   you what will happen is somebody with some killer feature will be too scared to say something because
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:09.020]   they're not sure how to say it well. And you and I both know because we've seen many companies that
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.260]   have gone through that cycle, those companies decay and die.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:18.960]   Yeah, I think it'd be great if a policy like this wasn't necessary. I mean, I agree it's
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:23.860]   suboptimal, but I think it's caused by the fact that people just can't get along around politics
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:24.140]   anymore.
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:31.460]   Yeah. Friedberg, what is your take on ultimately how Coinbase winds up the year or two after this?
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:39.820]   Do they get more resumes of hyper talented people who want to embrace a politics social issue free
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:48.920]   workplace? Or do millennials and you know, Gen C and this next group of talented folks say I don't
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:53.840]   want to work for somebody who doesn't want to talk about these issues at work. And then at the
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:54:00.520]   where you have a factory where you build companies. Do you have some rule around this yourself?
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:06.440]   Or thoughts about how you run your companies? I think the more clearly you define culture,
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:12.520]   the more successful your company will be. And right or wrong about whether or not you enable
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:18.200]   the debate in the discussion and how you define the forums for kind of political discussion within
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:23.880]   your company, the fact that there is a clear definition of delineation around this point,
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:28.760]   I think removes the uncertainty. And I think he'll do exactly what he's hoping to do, which is to get
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:34.120]   people to leave and to attract other people that better fit with that cultural model. I want to put
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:39.400]   my game face on, I want to go to work and I want to win the game I'm here to play. I'm not here to
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:44.200]   fuck around. I'm not here to do other stuff. I want this job because I believe in this mission.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:48.440]   And I want this company to succeed in what it's trying to do. And I think other places
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:53.640]   that allow people to run around and, you know, do things that they may or may not appreciate
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:59.240]   other people doing or, and you have this kind of low definition kind of culture, where some people
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:05.640]   are happy, some people are unhappy, it all kind of, you know, slows things down. And I wouldn't
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:11.960]   kind of encourage anyone to let that happen. I think it's really important to just define how it
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.400]   is you want to operate, be really clear about the rules and the boundaries and then
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:21.960]   that I agree with as well. I mean, I think it's very much within his right. And I think it took it,
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.400]   I do applaud his courage,
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.240]   courage and doing it, I just think that it misses the mark, because I think it was too emotional.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:31.080]   I think he could do a 2.0 version and just keep building on the manifesto and say,
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:36.440]   hey, based on the feedback I got, here's how we're going to do it. No discussion. He on the
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.880]   look at what
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:42.840]   Reid Hastings put out that fantastic PowerPoint that I think we all know really well,
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:46.200]   the cultural playbook from Netflix. And when did he put that out? Like,
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:46.840]   2000?
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.440]   A decade ago?
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.280]   No, two decades ago, 2000.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.080]   2001.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.160]   And he's continued to refine it, right? If you look at
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.680]   it, there's recent iterations of it, and they continue to kind of do a better job of defining,
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:04.200]   you know, how do they intend to operate with people. And I think it's, it's only continue
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:09.960]   to reinforce the innovation that drives that company into the $100 billion plus valuation
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.080]   it's earned.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:17.160]   Yes. And if you if there's one important thing, which is that there's a meaningful difference in
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:21.320]   the average age of a Netflix employee and the average age of a Silicon Valley company. Now,
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:22.920]   that may be also part of it as well.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:29.160]   I think the one thing that Brian could clarify is that you don't have to check your conscience
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:34.200]   at the door. You it's not we're not saying that you can't have political views. You're allowed
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:39.400]   to say things on Twitter or take political stands or donate to whoever you want. It's just that the
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.880]   company itself is going to be a demilitarized zone. You know, we're not going to bring we're
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.920]   not going to bring these contentious, divisive debates that really aren't related to our core
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:52.680]   mission inside the company. So we can all work better. So we can all work better as a team.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.000]   Yeah, I think that's a really important thing to say. And I think that's a really important thing
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.240]   towards the reason that we all joined this company.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.920]   But that's totally fair. But you know, all I'm saying all I'm saying again, I'll just say it
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:04.200]   again. That is such an important thing to say. You could have had a proofread a couple times.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:07.720]   You didn't could have been could have come across the way you're saying it.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.440]   It didn't have to be written by GPT-3. You know what I mean?
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:16.200]   Also, I think that it was the the dunk he did afterwards where he's like, and
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:21.800]   by the way, if you don't like it, here's four months severance. Get the fuck out.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:26.440]   That was a pretty aggressive move as well. I don't know how you guys felt.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.000]   I think I think I kind of like the gangster nature of it.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.080]   I like I think it's I think it's great. It's like, if I'm on the team, and I believe in what he just
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:37.240]   said, I feel great that he's flushing the shit out. And if I don't agree with it, it's like,
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.720]   fuck, yeah, I'll take it. You know, like, it's really clear. And I think the clear cut definition
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:46.120]   of culture is what every company needs to kind of pursue. And it's an ongoing pursuit. And you
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:50.440]   can always do a better job with it. And culture is what you choose not to do as much as it is what
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:50.920]   you do, right? I'm not going to talk about culture. I'm not going to talk about culture.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.280]   I'm not going to talk about politics.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.800]   Friedberg is totally right. It takes a lot of courage to say, here's what I believe.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.200]   And if you don't, if you don't believe it, then it's okay for you to leave. And
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.800]   here's a severance package that takes a lot of courage. So I applaud him for that.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.920]   Yeah, I mean, look, it's a free country. And we all have limited time,
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.880]   we should all go work on the mission that is most important and inspiring to us.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:17.480]   And Coinbase has a very specific mission that Brian's defining. He's trying to find it clearly.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.840]   And if that mission is important and inspiring to you, then go work there. And if it's not,
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:27.160]   then go work at the place where the mission does inspire you. And it may be a startup or maybe
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:32.760]   a political organization, whatever it is, go do that thing that's most meaningful to you.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.800]   That's kind of my interpretation of what he was saying.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.560]   All right, as we wrap here,
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.280]   It was hard for me to interpret because it was so poorly written.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:46.920]   Well, also, I mean, it was also like a huge bomb on Twitter. And people's reaction to it
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.680]   was based upon, I think, how they feel at this moment in time. And a lot of people feel,
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:55.640]   This is why, I'm sorry, but communications is important. How you say things, what you say,
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.440]   style is really important.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.680]   Yeah, whether it's Biden or Brian.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.680]   Take the time, get it right.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:08.120]   Yeah. All right. So 2021 is going to be upon us before we know it.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.240]   And I wanted to wrap here with each of your feelings on
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:20.680]   the economy, technology and politics, economy, technology, politics. How do you feel about 2021?
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:27.000]   Are you optimistic, pessimistic, neutral on those economy, politics, technology?
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.920]   Have you guys ever been to Magic Mountain or Disneyland?
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:31.400]   Of course.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   You ever get in one of those log rides and it's like raging rapids or roaring waters or whatever
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:37.960]   they're called?
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:38.360]   Sure.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:41.640]   And it's just fucking like you hop in and this thing just takes off down the river.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:45.960]   I don't know. Nothing summarizes it better for me.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:50.600]   But in so many ways, is that where I feel we are right now? We've all jumped on a bunch of
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:56.280]   fucking logs and we're shooting down this rapid river. And I think a big part of what I'm feeling
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.640]   and Chamath is in the middle of this, but there's this extraordinary velocity of capital right now.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:07.400]   And when I say that, I just mean capital is moving in large amounts very freely.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.400]   And that creates like once in a generation kind of opportunity. It's
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:16.120]   in part because the Fed has dropped interest rates to zero. So there's all these trillions
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.520]   of dollars moving markets. There's a change in an outlook and the world is being shifted in so
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:25.880]   many ways. This is this really amazing moment that I think we can all be afraid of because
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:32.040]   we're on a fucking roaring rapid on a log trying to stay afloat. But there is so much happening
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:38.040]   in these markets that we kind of operate in. There's never been a better time to get your
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:43.240]   business funded or to take your company public or to get customers to make quick decisions and
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.520]   change their behavior, whether they're a consumer or an enterprise customer.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:50.440]   Money and decisions are happening at a... Money is moving at a faster pace than we've ever
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:55.400]   seen and decisions are happening at a faster pace than we've ever seen. That's my general
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.200]   sentiment. I don't think it stops going into 2021. There's just another kind of floodgate about to
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.720]   open with this election one way or the other. But we're in the middle of this kind of raging
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:11.800]   rapids right now. And it's a pretty scary but also kind of exciting kind of time.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:19.880]   It's so well said, Quinoa. I really agree with you. I think that it's kind of like if you used to take a second,
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:26.280]   to make a $1 decision and a minute to take a $100 decision, the amount of money being flooded into
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:33.720]   the economy now allows you to make a $100 decision in a second. So like the order of magnitude of the
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:40.600]   mental barrier that it takes has changed. And I agree with you. I was thinking earlier this week
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:49.160]   that it's really incredible time to be alive in one very specific way, which is obviously there's
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:49.800]   stuff that's happening. There's a lot of stuff happening. There's a lot of stuff happening.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:55.800]   That's really turbulent. But there is a chance that a bunch of us can really
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:07.000]   like, change things in a meaningful way. And I find it exciting. So I'm generally like,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.800]   I'm super bullish on the economy. I'm super bullish on tech. And I think I'm actually kind of like
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:19.720]   reasonably optimistic about politics. I think that we're going to find our civility
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:27.160]   soon. And I don't know why that's going to happen or how it's going to get triggered.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:34.840]   But I think honestly, like the election of Biden will go such a long way to just
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:42.680]   showing what is rewarded and then to figure out how to reward
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.960]   the folks that were supporting Trump in the first place for purposes of economic
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.200]   pushback.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.440]   Preston Pysh : Could be a nice de-escalation,
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   in fact, and maybe an olive branch if Biden can bring that Republican party into the conversation.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.920]   Jay Gould : Yeah. And Sachs had this really beautiful
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:06.840]   thing that he posted on Twitter, which was like, a lot of San Francisco's dysfunction
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:12.040]   is really going to spread wealth throughout the rest of the country, because a lot of cities that
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:17.800]   were shut out of all these tech gains will now see it. And now you can imagine all kinds of people.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.680]   Jay Gould : There's a guy that I
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.840]   follow on Twitter. He lives in Bowie, Maryland. He's an engineer at VMware,
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:30.600]   this black guy. And he was just talking about how he got promoted and he's now a principal engineer.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:37.560]   And I just thought like, this is really fucking cool. There's going to be all this redistribution
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:44.120]   of opportunity all around the country. And that'll happen because of coronavirus, because
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:49.480]   of people's frustration with California, because of a handful of us, how fed up we've gotten with
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.600]   the culture of Silicon Valley, including by the way, what Brian Armstrong wrote, which again,
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:00.280]   still very important. And so we'll all be better off for that. So I don't know, I'm pretty optimistic.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.760]   Preston Pysh : Sachs Tech Economy Politics 2021.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:11.240]   Jay Gould : Well, I'm super bullish about the entrepreneurial
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:18.120]   energy in the American economy. It's 100 times greater than when we started out our careers in
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.400]   this business 20 years ago. Jay Gould : Yeah. I mean, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of work.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.080]   Preston Pysh : And I think it's important to think about the
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.720]   things that we've done in the last 10, 20 years ago in terms of the number of companies that get
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:31.160]   funded, the ideas, the tools that are available, the funding. I mean, when you think about it, this
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:36.040]   might be the first time in human history where money is chasing the, like throwing money at the
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:42.280]   ideas. I mean, throughout history, until I'd say the last 10, 20 years ago, the people who had no
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:49.320]   money but had great ideas always had to go hat in hand to go find the capital. And now it's completely
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.440]   different. You can't find the people with ideas. Jay Gould :
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.400]   It was worse than that, Sachs. They had to go give their ideas to a big company and take a salary.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.880]   Preston Pysh : Right. So Tesla, Nikola Tesla,
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.920]   the original inventor, didn't profit at all from his ideas. And so that was pretty common.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:12.440]   And so just how entrepreneurial the US economy has become, I'm very… The new economy has completely
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:19.240]   taken over and I'm bullish on that. I think the tweet that Chamath was referencing, I said that
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.720]   San Francisco's loss is going to be America's gain, the rest of America's gain, because
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:28.200]   middle America was really left out of the new economy. It's just not where it was taking place.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:34.520]   And so globalization really gutted industrial America, agricultural America. They didn't get
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:38.840]   to participate in the enormous wealth creation of the last two or three decades. And I think,
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:45.560]   I guess, because of what San Francisco has done in terms of driving out companies,
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:49.160]   I think the companies are going to be… Tech companies are going to be all over the US now.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.200]   Preston Pysh : Yeah, totally. It's fucking awesome.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.680]   Jay Gould : Should be super interesting. And so
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:02.440]   let's just lay the odds as we wrap here on Biden winning. Biden…
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.280]   Preston Pysh : 65-35, approaching 70-30.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:13.160]   Jay Gould : Okay. David, you got a handicap for me on Biden winning?
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.680]   What do you think, Sax?
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.080]   David Morgan : Well, I mean, the betting line,
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:25.080]   is like somewhere in the 60 to 70% range. And so you'd have to say that the betting markets
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:31.320]   are probably pretty accurate. I guess, probably there's a 70% chance of him winning if I had to
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:37.880]   bet on that line. I'd probably take the 30% underdog, because I think things are in so
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.880]   much turmoil right now that anything could still happen.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.040]   Preston Pysh : So you think there's a chance that Trump could win?
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.240]   David Morgan : Yeah, and it's probably bigger than 30%. It's
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.480]   slightly bigger than what the betting markets are giving him credit for.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.000]   Jay Gould : Friedberg, what are your thoughts?
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   Preston Pysh : Probably right. Yeah, I don't have anything to add to that.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.720]   Jay Gould : All right. Any speculation that we want to end with, Chamath?
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:03.880]   On the, I just noticed that Emil from Uber is doing a SPAC. Mark Pincus is doing a SPAC.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.760]   Everybody's doing SPACs now. Any speculation on what we're going to see in that market?
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.800]   Chamath Nani : Nope. God bless them. And I love you all, besties.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.760]   Jay Gould : All right, besties.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.640]   Chamath Nani : Back to the grind.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.920]   Jay Gould : Back to the grind. We'll see you next time. You know what to do.
