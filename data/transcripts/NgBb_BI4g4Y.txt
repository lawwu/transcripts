[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.120]   Joe in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey writes, "Pastor John, on Facebook you recently said,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.560]   'Christ did not die to create saved loners. He died to create Christ-exalting friendships.'"
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.680]   Can you please explain this? A lot of Christians are loners. Many of them are hurting, perhaps
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.600]   victims of the church, perhaps they're victims of the lies that they believe. How would you
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.040]   encourage or motivate Christian loners? There are a lot of Christian loners, some by choice and some
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:45.760]   not by choice. And my point was, God's aim in the death and resurrection and work of Christ today
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.600]   is to move people beyond that stage. If they're in it, if you're in a stage where you are a
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.760]   Christian loner because you want to be, or you're a Christian loner because you feel like people have
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.960]   given you no choice but to be, God sent his Son to change that. He wants to move you,
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:19.440]   not just to be a soul-satisfied friend of Jesus, but to be a soul-satisfied friend to friends,
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.480]   so that you experience Jesus through others as well as directly. And here's where that came from,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:35.120]   Tony. I preached a few months ago from 2 Timothy 4, where Paul said, "At my first defense,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:44.320]   no one stood by me. Everybody deserted me, but the Lord stood by me and strengthened me." Now,
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.200]   you could take that verse and say, "See? He didn't need people. Jesus was his friend. Jesus will
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.720]   never fail. People will always fail you. I'm tired of dealing with people. They're just fickle, and
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.360]   they let you down. And I'm going to be like Paul and have the Lord stand by me. And if everybody
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.840]   forsakes me, that's their problem. I've got Jesus." That is totally not what Paul experienced in that
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.320]   chapter, because he said just a little bit later to Timothy, "Do your best to come to me before
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.280]   winter." And he said a little earlier, "Luke alone is with me. Get Mark. Bring him with you. He is
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.200]   useful to me in the ministry." This is Paul's heart in all of his letters. Paul hated being
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.320]   in ministry alone. When he was forced to go alone to Athens, first thing he did was send back,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.200]   "Please get Timothy and the team down here as soon as you can. I don't want to be here in this city
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:57.680]   by myself." And so I think it stands that Christ died so that we would not be Christian loners,
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.040]   but would be in Christ-exalting friendships, because if you say, "Why?" It's because there's
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.360]   more of Christ to be known in Christ-exalting friendships. You know, I don't want to twist
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.880]   the arm of a loner and say, "You ought to do this, and it's your duty to do this." I want to say,
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.400]   "You're missing something, really missing something. There is more of Christ to be known.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.640]   There's more of God to be known. God said to a happy man, 'It is not good for you to be alone.'
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.920]   And Paul said to a church, 'The eye can't say to the hand, "I have no need of you." The head can't
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.440]   say to the feet, "I have no need of you."'" They can't. And if you're a head or an eye or a hand
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.560]   or a finger or pinky or big toe standing off by yourself saying, "I don't need them," you're wrong.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.400]   Paul says you're wrong. So here's my encouragement. First of all, to the loners who think they don't
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.240]   need others, I would say you're kicking against the pricks. God has more for you, much more of
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.360]   himself than you will have on your own. And the thing I'd say by way of encouragement to the
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.280]   Christian loner who feels that he or she has no choice, that they've been kicked into loneliness,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:30.000]   I would say, "I'm sorry for what has happened to you. I'm sorry that that's been done to you."
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.280]   And I would say, "Please, don't give up on the one never-failing friend because other friends
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:46.320]   have failed you." And I would say, "For the sake of Christ, forgive those who have failed you.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.040]   Unforgiveness is suicidal. It hurts you more than it hurts them." And I would say,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:01.520]   "Move toward a Bible-preaching church with the prayer that God will guide you. He has a community
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:12.240]   for you. Trust him for this." And I would say, finally, "Be, be for others what you long for them
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.040]   to be for you." Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast. Please email
