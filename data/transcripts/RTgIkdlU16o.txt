[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.480]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound, where each week we go through dozens and dozens
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.540]   of questions from you, the viewer, to figure out what to answer.
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.940]   On today's show, we're answering questions about some career advice from young financial
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.320]   advisors, figuring out when you actually need an advisor heading into retirement, why tips
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.880]   have performed so poorly despite the highest inflation in four decades, when it makes sense
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.900]   to allocate to your taxable account instead of your 401(k), and then how to put cash to
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.440]   work into stocks at all-time highs.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.940]   Remember our email here, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.

[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.240]   Everyone hates inflation, but no one is doing anything about it.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.140]   You just keep spending money, right?
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.980]   It's hard to change your behavior.
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.980]   Rocket Money is here to help.
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.860]   Listen, I have subscriptions to streamers.
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.380]   I still have magazine subscriptions, physical magazines, gym memberships, music stuff.
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.140]   Duncan, you probably have a hat of the month club, I'm sure.
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.140]   - That's a good idea.

[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.160]   I like it.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160]   - Great app.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.040]   I love that it shows you what's coming up that week too, so you know exactly what's
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.360]   coming out, because it warns you.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.200]   - Yes, it could be kind of painful to see what you spent last week, but I always get
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.600]   the undetected spending, and you kind of, "Wait, what is this?"
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   - Right.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   - All right.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   Let's get into a question.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600]   - All right.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   Up first today, we have a question from John.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.160]   "I heard Josh on the Ryan Russillo podcast a few years ago talking about older advisors
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.720]   who promise their practice to younger advisors, but then never leave.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.760]   I'm in that exact situation right now.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.040]   I was promised a book of business by my senior advisor who said he was planning on retiring
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   soon.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.180]   Fast forward five years, and he's still around and showing no desire to let go.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.360]   What do I do?
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.360]   I help out his clients so I can't exactly take them and leave.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.720]   Do I wait him out?
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.720]   Feels like I'm stuck."
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.720]   - All right.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.920]   Well, let's bring in Josh to help with those.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   I've heard Josh talk about this thing for years.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920]   - Same.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920]   Hey, Josh.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920]   - Josh, you predicted this.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.320]   You said, "Listen, these guys that say they're going to retire, they never retire, especially
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.120]   in the wealth management business, because why do you need to?
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.260]   It's not like you're doing back-breaking work, and if these younger advisors are handling
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.320]   all the behind-the-scenes stuff for you, why do you need to?"
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.480]   So this is going to happen forever.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480]   - Why would you?
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.920]   Yeah, you're not a band-saw operator.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.120]   You're not at physical risk.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120]   You're talking on the phone.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.120]   You're playing golf.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.120]   No one leaves.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.840]   - And we know boomers are going to have a hard time letting go of their jobs, especially
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.160]   like this.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.200]   So what do you tell young people like this?
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.120]   Because most of them are kind of stuck.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.000]   - Well, all right.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.960]   So this is not easy.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.200]   And I feel very confident saying the things that I'm about to say and not offending people,
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.120]   because I'm always the first person to say how stupid my own career path was in my 20s
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120]   and early 30s.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.520]   So I don't mean this disrespectfully.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.600]   I mean this as somebody who has all the battle scars.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.080]   Never work for a family business if you're not part of the family.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.240]   This is the number one thing.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.400]   So many young guys, they end up as part of a team, but it's not really a team.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.360]   They end up as the grunt working for somebody who is either at a large wire house or has
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.560]   left a large wire house and has their own independent practice.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.360]   And then before you know it, like, oh, my son is graduating in two years and he's going
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.640]   to intern now.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.040]   And then the guy's son's going to be your boss.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.400]   What are you, stupid?
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.120]   How do you not see that coming from a mile away?
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120]   What's wrong with you?
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.640]   And if it's not his son, it's whoever his daughter marries, his son-in-law might be
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.560]   your boss.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.520]   So this is like, I mean, this is not, this is so universal, just beyond financial advisory.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.520]   So that's one.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.480]   Two, it's not a business that people retire from.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.800]   I've seen people sell a firm, sit around for 18 months and then start a new firm and then
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.280]   call back all their old clients.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.160]   Like nobody leaves, nobody stops working.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.040]   And all of the research that advisors themselves use to talk with clients about the concept
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.200]   of retirement states, like literally the last thing you should do is stop working forever
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.800]   or stop doing everything.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.760]   So more frequently, you'll see the candle slowly go out and not be blown out.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.880]   So it's not like, oh, I'm 70, today's my retirement, where's my cake?
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.120]   It's like, oh, I'm going to slow down a little bit.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.720]   And that process can play out for like 10 years and they're in Boca and you're in Pittsburgh
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.940]   grinding out, you know, financial planning, quarterly meetings.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.800]   So the right answer, I think, is think in terms of like, what would be a better career
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.840]   for yourself?
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.480]   Be completely beholden to one Jedi master and hope that, you know, he or she honors
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.320]   their word or work at a firm that's got a career path where you don't have to wait somebody
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.320]   out.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.840]   And, you know, I'm obviously talking our book because we are providing that career path
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   for young advisors.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.320]   Unfortunately, I can't take 10 of them.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.680]   I don't, I don't have, but that type of firm, that type of opportunity is what you should
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.900]   be looking for when you're interviewing.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.000]   And if it's like a, a situation where you're going to be backed into the corner or waiting
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.760]   on someone else's lifestyle to change, that's probably not your best bet to take that role.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.480]   - Your point about the family business is so key.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.480]   That was my situation.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.840]   My very first job I worked for the guy had started the business, the consulting business,
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.760]   and all three of his kids worked for him.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.680]   - Yeah, where'd you think that was going?
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.800]   - But he even laid it out.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   He said, listen, this is a three-year job for you.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.520]   I'm going to teach you everything I know, and I'm going to help you find a new job,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.380]   but you have an escape hatch.
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.840]   You don't want to stay here for more than three years.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   So I think you have to have that.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.160]   Do you think it's even worth talking to these people?
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.080]   Like going back to the guy and saying, listen, you told me you're going to leave soon.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080]   What's the story?
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.200]   Is it even worth it having that conversation or do you look for your own escape hatch and
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.520]   just try to find something else?
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   - Yeah.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.560]   You know, I think, I think having that conversation is great the first or second time, but then
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.000]   it's like going to be dependent on the honor of the person involved.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.640]   And by honor, I don't mean, oh, this guy really wants more opportunity.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.480]   I better leave sooner because that ain't going to happen.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.680]   You could end up talking to somebody that's like it secretly in the process of selling
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.120]   their firm to a private equity buyer or to a rollup or an aggregator.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.880]   And then it's like, oh, he did retire, but you know how he did it?
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.480]   He sold the business out from under me.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.960]   And now I have to go to whatever firm we were sold to.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.240]   So I think if you're open, if, if I think it's each situation is going to be dependent
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.400]   on, on who that senior advisor is and how honest they are with, and you know, it's a
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   whole spectrum.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.400]   Everyone's different.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.320]   - You want to have your own, you want to like be as independent as you can, even if you're
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   working for someone else in terms of like having clients that are attached to you in
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.320]   some way.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.320]   - Yeah.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:36.880]   Look, the reality is that in some cases, the senior advisor does so little as the years
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.600]   go on and has such little contact day to day with these families, especially the younger
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.400]   generations within these families, that the apprentice advisor really ends up becoming
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   de facto the actual advisor.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.600]   And then in that case, there's some mobility.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.480]   It's like, look, I'm not going to like try to recruit your whole business away, but I'm
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.240]   doing all the work and I'm going to leave and we'll see where they, we'll see where
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.240]   this shakes out.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.120]   I'm glad you played golf with this dude's grandfather, but I'm the one in their lives
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.000]   really helping them and answering questions.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.640]   So, you know, it is what it is.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.000]   I wouldn't be afraid to make that leap.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.880]   Understand that you're probably not going to leave retaining most of the clients if
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.240]   they weren't yours to begin with, but do what you got to do if that's what it takes to get
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.520]   yourself up and running.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.280]   But I have to reiterate this, I think it's really important.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:34.160]   There's like this mental illness in our industry amongst young people and it's not their fault.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:41.080]   They're being sold this idea that like they could graduate from CFP track in college and
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.120]   within two years be running their own firm.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:50.120]   Yeah, maybe, but most of you can't because most businesses don't succeed in any endeavor.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.560]   And this is even harder than most businesses.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.320]   Think about what you're trying to do.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.960]   You're trying to get people in their fifties and sixties to entrust somebody that's the
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.640]   age of their son or grandson with their life savings.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.160]   Why would they do that?
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.140]   So now you have to deal with younger clients who have less assets and are less willing
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.680]   to pay for advice because their lives are less complex.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.520]   That's really, really hard.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:23.640]   So I think like focus on career path, where do I really learn how to be an advisor?
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.440]   And in some cases it might be sitting side by side with a solo practitioner who runs
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.400]   their own show independently somewhere.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   But for most people, that's not great.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.880]   Like you want to look for an enterprise that's willing to teach you, even if it's not where
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.160]   you want to end your career.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:48.600]   Look, manning the desk at Schwab or Fidelity is a way better path in my opinion, than sitting
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.640]   next to a 55 year old.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.960]   Because over the next five years, you know, for a fact, the 55 year old's not retiring.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.480]   But if you do that time at Vanguard or Schwab, you know, for a fact, you're talking to thousands
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.000]   of clients.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.120]   You're honing your chops, you're getting reps, and you're actually delivering advice, helping
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.400]   people.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.600]   None of those may end up being your future clients, but you're learning how to do this.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.480]   And you're giving yourself the experience to become valuable for wherever your next
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.040]   stop is going to be.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.600]   Even if that ends up being your own firm.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.600]   Yeah, the delusion of young people you're talking about is, it's so much easier for
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.720]   them to research their career path these days.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.080]   And people come out of school saying, I want to work for an RIA, which is really hard as
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.280]   an entry level position.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.960]   So I agree, you go to that big firm first, you learn a bunch of stuff, you put the reps,
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.920]   and then you move on to an RIA.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.760]   We've trained a couple of young people right out of school.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.260]   That's not what we want to do in general.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.020]   We happen to have met a couple of superstars.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:55.740]   But I don't think we're a great first firm for students coming out of school.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:02.080]   Because I think when they come to us, it's such a long period of time before we're going
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:08.200]   to be, from a quality control standpoint, it's going to take so long before we can actually
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:14.160]   put them in a seat where they can alter their own trajectory of their career.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.580]   They're going to learn so much from us.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.040]   But for a lot of young people, there's impatience.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.080]   And I totally understand it.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.000]   I also think they don't even realize our young advisors, if they've been to two or three
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.280]   firms before they come to us, they realize why what we're doing is so special, in my
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   opinion.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.640]   I think if you first come to me, you don't even understand what goes on out there, and
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.160]   you don't even understand why what we're doing is special.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:44.420]   So I just spoke to a group of college kids last week, and shout to Nate Jefferson, who
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:50.320]   is one of our superstar young advisors, a Michigan State.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.040]   And I'm not pitching these kids to come work at our RIA.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:01.120]   I think most of them would be better off at a larger firm to really get reps and then
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.680]   come to me, like come to me in three to five years when you actually know the difference
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.200]   between all the firms in the industry.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.160]   And that's like a much better path.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160]   Right.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.000]   But your first thing you said is the important point.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   It's not easy.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.100]   Whatever path is, it's not going to be easy.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.100]   It's a great career.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.880]   Why should it be easy?
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.040]   If this were easy, why wouldn't millions of people do this for a living?
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   Because it's not.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   All right, Duncan, next question.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.040]   Let's do it.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   All right.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   Next, we have a question from Larry.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   Larry writes, Josh is right that I'm inclined to trust my money with someone that I like,
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.720]   which I'm sure is the thought behind all the content you put out.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.160]   My question is, when do I know it's time to make that call?
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.000]   I have a goal number in mind, which I'm tracking towards nicely, but I'd hate to be too conservative
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.760]   or too aggressive as I approach retirement.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   I'm currently 14 to 16 years away from retirement.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.360]   When do I make the call for help?
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.520]   Five years away from retirement, a year, six months.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.120]   I'm curious to hear what you guys have to say on this, because six months to a year
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.880]   doesn't sound like much time to get a lot of help from a firm.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.880]   No.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.920]   Well, there's going to be millions of people asking this question you just had.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.280]   John, throw this chart up here.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.760]   This shows the number of people turning 65 by year, and I guess it's a record this year.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.680]   It's going to be a record next year.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.760]   There's going to be millions of...
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.320]   We've never had this many people live this long who have this much money, and there's
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   obviously different...
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:30.520]   Is this saying that every year for the next seven years, we're going to have 4 million
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.960]   new people turn 65?
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.580]   Yes.
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.060]   The person who was asking the question about financial advice, the person, financial advisors,
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:43.540]   this is so bullish for financial advisors, because for people who have built wealth,
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:48.440]   the idea of saving or starting a business and creating wealth, that part is a little
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.320]   easier than transitioning into the next phase of financial planning of, "I have to spend
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.400]   it now, and I have to figure out taxes in retirement, and I'm not making as much money,"
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.440]   and all this other stuff is people are going to be turning to someone, a professional,
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.360]   for financial advice.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.960]   I think Larry here sounds like a DIY group, which we deal a lot of, people who've done
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.960]   it themselves.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.040]   They know how to create a portfolio, they know how to save, they know how to live on
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.720]   less than they earn, all that stuff, but now they need some expertise from going from a
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.280]   saver to a spender, and when is that?
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.520]   I think that's a question that a lot of these people have to figure out, and a lot of times
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:31.520]   it's, "Listen, I have a spouse or family members who are dependent on me, and God forbid, something
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.280]   should happen to me that I'm getting older.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.680]   I want to make sure something's okay," or, "Listen, I don't have the expertise to handle
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.040]   my finances in retirement.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.960]   I need to outsource this to someone else."
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.800]   I think that's the idea.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.480]   I don't know if there is a perfect time to do it, but I think it's kind of, if you're
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.400]   asking the questions, you're getting close.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.640]   Yeah, I think that's right, and go back to the phrasing of the question.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.600]   He said he's 14 to 16 years away from retirement, when do I pull the trigger?
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.880]   I'm not sure that's framing the question correctly.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.660]   I don't think it's temporal, like how many years before I retire, should I?
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:14.440]   I think it's more like, what is the level of complexity in your financial, in your life,
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.080]   in your financial life, and what is the trajectory of that?
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.080]   Because it's seemingly getting more complex with every passing year, and for a lot of
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.160]   households, the answer is yes, because you just have so many more moving parts, so many
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.540]   more variables.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:38.360]   The other thing is, and this is kind of universal, anxiety doesn't diminish with increased financial
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.600]   wherewithal.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.920]   You're probably not worried about, "How do I pay my bills?"
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.000]   If you're in your late 40s, early 50s, making good money, okay, so that's different from
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.160]   your 20s and 30s, but you're worried about other things, and we will always find room
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.440]   to have anxiety and to worry.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:02.840]   Yeah, am I going to be okay, am I making the right decisions, how do I not screw this up?
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.320]   That's the thing a lot of these people want to, and it's, when you get to retirement age,
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.800]   it's, do I have enough to live on, and wait, can I buy this second home on the lake, or
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.240]   can I take this trip, and that's the stuff that you want someone to lean on when you're
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.840]   anxious about all those decisions, and you want someone to help you make better decisions,
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.680]   or sign off for you, and say, "Yes, you can do this, it's well within your financial plan."
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.640]   That's when you need the help.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.080]   I think that's right, so there's no right answer, it's not a number of years till retirement,
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.440]   it's not an age, it's not a dollar amount.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.560]   It's at a level where you say, "You know what?
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   This has gotten to the point where it's costing me peace of mind.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:47.000]   There are so, I have more questions than answers, and I just want a pro in my life, and let
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.680]   me just get started on the path, and let me at least start talking to advisors, and seeing
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.760]   what they even do."
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.760]   You would be shocked.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.280]   Yeah, if he's that far away, he can at least have some conversations, doesn't have to sign
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.280]   his life away.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.880]   Yeah, you would be shocked at how many people just don't even know what wealth management
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.020]   and financial planning is.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.800]   Think about how many people come to us, and the first encounter they have with one of
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:16.240]   our CFPs, they think we're doing security selection, or market timing.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.840]   Everyone wants Josh's stock picks.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:23.240]   Yeah, and we have to reorient, it's like, "All right, we'll get some portfolio stuff
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.360]   in the third meeting, fourth meeting, but can we figure out where you even are today?"
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.960]   Yeah, where you are, where you're going, and all that stuff.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.440]   Right, so you could have that conversation any time is the right answer.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.320]   Yeah, fair question, though, but I think if you're getting to ask the question, you at
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.320]   least start talking to people.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.320]   All right, next one, Duncan.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.760]   All right, up next we have a question from Dylan.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:50.360]   "In March 2021, I bet on high inflation and bought $12,000 worth of tips, and have since
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.040]   seen the price drop per share.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.600]   I distinctly remember that at the time, inflation was not on most people's radar, which is why
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.120]   I'm confused about how it was priced in.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.800]   I probably wouldn't change anything because the dividend payments are nice, and it's good
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:09.440]   to have bonds in addition to my stock-heavy portfolio, but I'm wondering what I missed.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.760]   Why has the price dropped despite record high inflation?
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.880]   Can you guys further explain tips, bonds, and ETFs?"
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.720]   I guess there's probably a good lesson here in knowing what you own and why you own it.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.160]   This guy knows why he bought tips.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.880]   And how the product that you've chosen works.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.080]   John, do a chart on here.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.400]   I showed three bond funds on here, so I did TIP, which is the biggest tips fund.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.000]   I did the ag on here as well to show total bond, and then I did the short-term tips.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.880]   And you can see the ag is still-- this is from March 2021, when he says he made his
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.440]   inflation call.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.620]   You still outperformed in TIP.
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.320]   It was down a little more than 3%.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.080]   Ag is down more than 9%.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.240]   But the short-term tips are actually up 6%.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:59.320]   So you did better, and here's where our guy Dylan went wrong here.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.120]   There's two components to tips.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.480]   So it's the inflation components, so the Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.680]   You get that inflation hedge.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.540]   But they're also the bond component.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:14.880]   And if interest rates are rising, especially as much as they did in 2022, they're going
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.320]   to act more like bonds and stocks.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.600]   In that TIP, the average maturity is almost eight years on those bonds.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.160]   For the short-term one, it's more like two to three years.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.560]   And so you have way more interest rate risk than inflation protection on that longer-term
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.560]   tips.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.080]   And so that's why they acted more like bonds than an inflation hedge, and you still lost
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.080]   money.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   Whereas the shorter-term tips, because they're so short-dated, you actually take out the
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.800]   bond component much more in the interest rate risk and just have the inflation part.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   Ben, can we back up?
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.660]   Let's take the ETF part out of this.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.360]   I don't think that there is a genuine understanding amongst the public about the difference between
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.120]   TIPs and Treasury bonds.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:04.520]   Why would people think that TIPs would protect them from rising inflation?
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.760]   What is the aspect of TIPs that would even lead somebody to a TIPs ETF?
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:16.120]   TIPs are actually probably the most unique normal financial product that there are.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.920]   It's basically, you get a yield on these plus whatever inflation is every year.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.480]   So let's say you're-- The yield doesn't change.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.480]   The yield is fixed.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.480]   The yield is fixed.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.480]   It actually increases your principal.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.480]   But what can change is CPI.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.480]   So the CPI changes your principal.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:38.760]   So if you buy a bond for $100 and you earn 1% and inflation is 3, now you have $103.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:44.440]   It increases your principal, and that's one of the-- it's a real hedge against inflation.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:50.800]   The problem is, if interest rates rise, it still acts like a bond if you have duration.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.160]   And rates went much higher because these TIPs yields were so low, because we were having
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.820]   deflation in the early 2020s, that you were paying a negative yield on them to own that
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.040]   inflation protection.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.440]   So you didn't really get much bang for your buck.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.400]   There was no yield there to protect you, and interest rates went up, which meant bond prices
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   went down.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:15.360]   So you got kind of a double whammy of no yield, and it acted more like a bond than an inflation
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.360]   protection.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:25.060]   And I think when we look back on this period, we're going to remember that a lot of the
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:31.040]   attempts to hedge or protect against inflation worked against investors.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.260]   And they would have been better off trying to react as little to inflation as possible.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.120]   You look at commodity stuff.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.800]   You look at certain types of equities that historically have been good inflation protection.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:50.200]   You look at reducing NASDAQ and long duration growth bet exposure.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.360]   Some of these things initially worked in 2022, and then if you stuck with them for long,
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.360]   you got murdered.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:04.040]   Like in the case of TIPs, the rate of inflation was rising slower than the rate of interest
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.040]   rates.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.920]   Like the Fed was literally outrunning inflation.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.680]   So that actually works against you.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:17.260]   Now you have-- all right, so now you're hedged against inflation, but you're directly opposed
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.880]   to what the Fed is doing with overnight rates.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.000]   So you actually caused yourself more harm than had you just stuck with a low duration
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   or a money market fund.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.400]   You know, cash or money markets were your best hedge against inflation for the most
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.200]   part, because you had the short term rates ratcheted up so quickly, and you got to reinvest
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.640]   quicker.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.480]   And that's why-- I mean, you have to feel for these people who did this, because we
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.760]   heard from a lot of people who did this.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.480]   They said, listen, I thought inflation was a risk.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.280]   I invested in TIPs.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.720]   But you're probably getting more of that protection in TIPs from shorter term instruments.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.800]   The problem is, it'll be interesting, because if and when rates fall, the longer term TIPs
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.600]   will do better, because they have that bond component, and shorter term TIPs will lag.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.600]   But you're not-- On the way down.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   It's not because of inflation or anything.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.820]   It's just because they're going to act like bonds.
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.820]   You know what's going to be funny?
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.280]   Like in five years, they're going to be making TikTok videos showing the correlate-- they're
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:15.720]   going to show 2023, the biggest Fed interest rate increases in 40 years, and NVIDIA going
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   straight up.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   And they're going to say, the best inflation hedge is large cap semiconductor stocks.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.400]   So people should stop playing this game.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.680]   You can get the macro right and still get the trade wrong.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.600]   That's the point here, is understanding what you own.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.640]   But yeah, the simple hedges worked better.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.640]   And guess what?
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.040]   Even though the stock market was bumpy, the stock market is still your best long term
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   hedge against inflation.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040]   And I agree.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.440]   Trying to out think these things is maybe a little too-- getting a little too cute with
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.480]   these investments, since it was so short term.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.440]   Here's my full proof inflation hedge.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.200]   Ticketmaster just blasted out new Pearl Jam dates for later this year.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.280]   They're going to do two nights at Madison Square Garden, September 3rd and 4th.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.520]   Wait, I thought Eddie Vedder was going to wrestle with Ticketmaster's CEO.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.440]   I didn't think they used them anymore.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.400]   Maybe they found a way to do this where the Pearl Jam fan club doesn't get screwed over.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.320]   And because I'm part of it, I got this message.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.640]   I don't know.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:22.760]   Anyway, I guarantee you, whatever CPI is between now and September, the face value of Pearl
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.960]   Jam tickets the week before Labor Day in New York City is going higher.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.360]   It's almost like a-- I don't even think I can go to the show.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.840]   It's my wife's birthday.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.520]   But it's my inflation hedge.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.440]   So I put myself in the lottery.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.160]   However many tickets they'll let me buy, I'll buy them.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:44.680]   And I'm pretty sure I'll be hedging out some consumer inflation at a minimum.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.080]   You heard it here first, Josh Brown's inflation hedge.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.080]   Eddie Vedder.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:54.480]   Pearl Jam tickets MSG, almost a no-brainer, those are going to be $1,000 tickets.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.520]   The real best inflation hedge is having the ability to increase your income.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.640]   I think that's the thing most people probably miss on.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   Well, Nick Magiulli does a lot of content around that concept, is like, I don't care
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:12.920]   how much effort you're putting into optimizing your portfolio, put 10x that amount of effort
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.320]   into optimizing your career.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.680]   Because that's really going to be the difference maker.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.680]   And of course, he's right.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   The problem is you can't sell that in a newsletter or a trader alerts product.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.360]   That's why it's such valuable advice, because it's hard to package.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.520]   Yeah, because to your point about your career path, I had the same thing.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.320]   My career path was not normal.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.280]   It's hard to tell people, like, I did this crazy career path, now you try to try to mimic
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.280]   it.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.280]   It's impossible.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   You can't mimic anything.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.760]   Read these books about like the Wall Street legends.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.680]   You can't do anything these guys did.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.920]   The serendipity, like who they were in Columbia Business School with in 1965.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.720]   You're going to replicate that?
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:59.040]   So yeah, I think focus on how you're going to raise your level of income, keep your expenses
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:05.760]   in check, and give yourself the flexibility to grab hold of opportunities when they come.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:13.960]   That's what's going to make the difference, and not which tips ETF do I protect cash with.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.480]   That's not going to be the thing.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.720]   Did you see the government's going after shrinkflation?
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.920]   That could help, right?
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.120]   I thought junk fees.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.520]   They're doing shrinkflation too?
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.520]   Shrinkflation too.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   All right, good.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   All right, next question.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.560]   I think we have a question from another John.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.560]   Here's my take.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.000]   Hot, warm, cold, or whatever you determine it to be.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.040]   I feel like it makes more sense to put excess money in a taxable account than to max out
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.520]   a 401(k).
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.320]   My why here is that there's a lot of life to live between now and 59 and a half.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.640]   My biggest fear is turning 50 and just staring at a big pile of money we can't touch for
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.880]   10 years.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:54.280]   I think this strategy allows for us to have a rich life during all phases of our life
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.120]   and not just save it all for a specific period.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.280]   I'm well aware of the tax benefits of 401(k)s and the disadvantages of the taxable account.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.640]   At the end of the day, having that money more accessible just makes more sense to me.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.520]   Is it silly of me to think this way?
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.160]   I think they need some better fears, honestly, if that's their biggest fear of having a bunch
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.160]   of money at 50.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.480]   Josh, you mentioned Nick actually made the case on this show a couple years ago that
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.760]   you shouldn't max out your 401(k) and he was saying it's not worth giving up the flexibility
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.720]   you get from just owning index funds in a taxable account and it's kind of a negligible
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.320]   difference.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.800]   Bill Sweet might have a problem with this.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.320]   I don't agree with Nick's take, but I get where he's coming.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.520]   I'm not saying he's wrong because this is almost subjective.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:42.440]   There's always a mathematical answer and then a what's best for me personally answer.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.480]   I think what Nick was saying made a lot of sense, what this guy is asking makes a lot
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.480]   of sense.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   I think you have to know yourself.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:54.160]   For most people, they're not disciplined enough to take-- what's the contribution now, 23,000
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.160]   a year?
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.920]   For most people, they're not disciplined enough to take $23,000 a year of their own
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.680]   volition, a set amount out of every paycheck, set it aside into a brokerage account, and
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.740]   then not pull it out whenever they feel like it.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.740]   That is one of the benefits of the 401(k) structure.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.280]   It makes it almost impossible to get access to your money in a good way.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.600]   You never see it hit your checking account when you get paid either.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.200]   It's just taken off the top.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.360]   That's right.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.360]   That's behavioral.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.400]   Dude, Nick is a computer.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.840]   He computes.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.240]   He doesn't need that behavioral Jedi mind trick.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.720]   I actually like having the 401(k) stuff.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.640]   I actually like having it locked up so I'm not going to touch it in the next 20 years
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.960]   or whatever.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.160]   I like the fact that it's difficult to access.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   I don't even count it.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   I'm not even tempted to touch it.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.160]   Right.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.900]   I don't even think about it.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.120]   I look at it because I get an email.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.560]   We have a nice match at our firm and blah, blah, blah, and everyone's in it, and it's
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:01.400]   working out great, but I don't think about my 401(k) money because I'm 46.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.380]   I'm not going anywhere near it for two decades.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.120]   It's irrelevant.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.080]   It's fully invested in stocks, by the way, for anyone that's curious.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.240]   I wrote this in my book, How I Invest My Money.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.520]   I have zero cash.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.120]   I have zero bonds.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.000]   It's 100% invested in global equities.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.280]   I never change the amounts.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.840]   Whatever the max is, I max it out, and I never try to time it, and I never alter what I'm
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.280]   putting where, and I just leave it alone.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:36.320]   Since we started the firm in 2013, I think we had our first year for the plan that year.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.040]   It's done incredibly well, obviously.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.680]   Markets have done incredibly well.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.600]   Could I have optimized it?
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.000]   Could I have put in less and put more into a brokerage account and maybe use that money
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   differently?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.240]   Yeah, but I'm busy.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.440]   That's the other thing.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.680]   It's something that's already taken care of, automated.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.760]   I don't even think about it or look at it.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.000]   I do agree with this.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.240]   If he's saying, because we get a lot of people who say, "I want to retire at 55."
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.280]   For some reason, 55 is always the year.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.280]   I don't know why.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.280]   That's just the one people pick.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   It just sounds easy.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.760]   If you're going to retire early- What are you going to do at 55 years old?
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.760]   Fair.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.760]   No, honestly.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.800]   Literally, what do you think you're going to do?
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   Traveling?
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   How much golf?
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.640]   Seven days a week?
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640]   That is true.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.640]   You will not retire at 55.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.320]   No, if you want to retire early, you have to give yourself more flexibility.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.320]   I agree.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:28.520]   It's hard to think right now how you're going to feel at that age and what you're going
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.520]   to do with yourself.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.040]   Do you know people in their 50s?
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.640]   Do any of them seem like they should have more free time?
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.640]   To do what?
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.640]   Read about World War II?
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.600]   What are we doing here?
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.600]   You might sell your business.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   They could get super into politics?
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.800]   Sell your business, sit around for two years, sending emails to your kids that they don't
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.480]   read with jokes in them, and then at some point, you have to go do something with yourself
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.620]   or you're going to lose your mind.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.360]   This might be a regional thing.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.480]   I don't know anybody in their 50s who's retired.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.240]   I know very wealthy people in their 50s.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.760]   They're working more.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.720]   There's just so much to do in this world.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.960]   I don't know.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.640]   I can't relate to that, unless you really hate your job, which doesn't sound like is
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   this gentleman's problem.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.640]   All right.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.800]   We've got one more.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   All right.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.400]   Up next, we have a question that came in through Twitter, which by the way, I'm always, like
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.560]   you say, Ben, I'm always going to call it Twitter.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.000]   It's hard for me to remember to say X, but someone did call us out for the fact that
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.880]   we changed the name of our show from Portfolio Rescue to Ask the Comp Out.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   Oh, man.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   I got it.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   Someone did point out that we did that.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.880]   That's true.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   All right.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   If you want to call us Portfolio Rescue, I bet it.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.880]   Exactly.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   All right.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:44.880]   This one is, "Any advice for someone with a large cash position, but SPY, QQQ, and BTI
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.080]   are at or close to all-time highs, dollar-cost average, suck it up and buy?"
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   All right.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.640]   This is like-- The math says buy, but it's not always the
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.560]   right answer for every personality type.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.640]   This is like the psychological barrier of-- we showed on last week's show, the JP Morgan
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.120]   study that if you bought at all-time highs, your average returns over one, three, and
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.200]   five years are better than picking any random day.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:14.320]   So your average returns are higher from all-time highs, and I still get the psychological barrier
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.640]   that people have here of, "Yeah, but what if I put all my money in at the all-time high
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.320]   before bear market, and then I feel like an idiot?"
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   Totally.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   I mean, Ben, you did the definitive answer to that question, "What if I'm the worst market
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:34.640]   timer in history, and I only buy major generational tops in the market?"
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:40.840]   You looked at a hypothetical investor who bought 2007 and all of these other market
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.680]   tops, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the conclusion was even if you
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:53.680]   are the absolute jinx, these lump sum investments that you've made at generational market tops
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:00.320]   still haven't put you that much further behind the eight ball.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.000]   As long as you keep the money invested, you're probably going to be okay.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   As long as you don't give up.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Right.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   I think-- so, John, throw the chart up.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.440]   We've been talking about this for a while on all of our shows about the money market
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.440]   funds.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   We're at $6 trillion.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.800]   I think there's $2 trillion in CDs.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.400]   I think people in a lot of these funds are going to be having this conversation themselves
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.320]   like, "Geez, if the Fed cuts from 5% to 3%, what am I going to do now?
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.320]   Am I going to buy that?"
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.320]   Michael doesn't agree with you.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.240]   Michael thinks these assets are going to be sticky.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.720]   I think he's wrong, and I'm in your camp.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.360]   So a trillion dollars came into money markets last year.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:37.400]   I don't think a trillion comes back out and goes into the S&P 500, but I don't think it's
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.400]   sticky.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:44.720]   I think the longer this rally goes on, the less likely it is to be sticky, obviously.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:51.000]   But I could see treasuries being a hot asset class, like three- to five-year treasuries
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   being a hot asset class.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   That's the thing.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.360]   If you see short-term yields going down and bonds rallying because yields are falling,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.360]   then-- Yeah.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.360]   You're going to extend.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.920]   We're sending a letter this week, but we did that for our own clients.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.720]   It's like, look, we already made the short-duration bet during the pandemic.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.080]   It was not a market timing call.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.200]   It was just risk/reward.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:16.760]   Why take duration risk with rates at zero if everyone's earning the same yield anyway?
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.960]   And that ended up being a very wise move on the part of the investment committee.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.960]   Now it's the opposite.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:27.160]   We're not predicting what rates are about to do, but why wouldn't you extend?
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.800]   If it's not that much of a differential between short- and long-term rates, why wouldn't you
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.600]   get a little bit longer here just in case?
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:41.360]   If you want to dip a toe in dollar-cost average over months or quarters or whatever it is,
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.520]   I can get behind that, even if it's not the right spreadsheet answer.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.600]   I like AAA corporate bonds here.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.560]   I like municipal bonds.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.000]   I like anything other than cash right now.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.840]   I don't think we're getting the amount of rate cuts that the consensus seems to think
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.360]   we're getting this year.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.680]   But ultimately, the longer they leave rates higher, the more obvious it is that they're
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.720]   going to be forced to cut them.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.640]   Because we're about to run into commercial real estate refinancing risk.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.540]   We're about to run into a lot of corporate bonds repricing.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.320]   And it'll hit the lower end first, and people will dismiss it at first.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.440]   But ultimately, it'll cascade.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.440]   It'll get worse.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:28.660]   And the Fed will cut rates, because conditions will simply be proven to have been too tight.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.280]   So it's interesting.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.140]   It's a paradox.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.320]   You don't have to be betting on them cutting rates.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.760]   The better bet is to say, they're going to cut rates too late, but they're going to be
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.760]   forced to.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.080]   They're going to have to go even bigger.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:47.920]   So instead of getting 25 basis points once every other month, it'll be 50 basis point
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:53.480]   cuts, because they'll be reacting to some bank in Oklahoma blowing up.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:58.600]   So that's the way that I'm thinking about the next couple of years.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.660]   So I think that that's like a-- it's interesting.
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.320]   I don't think it's like a flight out of money market funds.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.040]   But I don't think it'll be as sticky as Michael thinks it will.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   We'll see.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.960]   I think it'll be a slow trickle.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.200]   And maybe that's the way to do it, too, if you're worried about that reinvestment risk.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.480]   Absolutely.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.480]   Was this good for you?
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.480]   Was this fun for you guys?
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.400]   Because I got to tell you, this is the highlight of my day.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.400]   That was great.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.400]   Yeah, it was great.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.400]   Always good to have you on.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   This is good.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.400]   Absolutely.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.400]   New TCAF on Friday.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.720]   Thanks to Josh, as always.

[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   Yeah, man.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.720]   Love you guys.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   Thanks so much for doing the show.
