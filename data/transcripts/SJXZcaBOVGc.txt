[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.240]   >> All right, for the sake of time, we're going to get started, and I know that there's
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.140]   still people kind of strolling in from the parking, but because of time, if you guys
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.480]   can see the schedule that we have, we've allotted one hour because we're trying to fit in.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.080]   Initially, we didn't have Q&A, but we thought that the Q&A would be necessary because of
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.400]   applicational issues, okay?
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.000]   So for that reason, it's going to be pretty packed, and for that reason, we are not having
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.440]   praise in the beginning, so we're going to go straight into the teaching, and then there's
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.820]   going to be a 10-minute break, and then come back to the second session, and then right
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.480]   after the second session, we're going to lead into the Q&A, okay?
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.480]   So depending on how the time works, that's kind of like the rough breakdown, so if we're
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.840]   off by 5 or 10 minutes, just be patient with us, just to give you what's going on.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.920]   So according to the sign-ups, this room should be packed, and because the parking, some people
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.280]   are still being shuttled back and forth, so if you have seats that you're sitting, and
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.920]   there's like a large gap in between, if we can ask you to fill that up.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.640]   So they might have signed up and not shown up, but either the case on paper, it should
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.200]   be packed, so if you can do your best to pack the seats in between, that would be helpful.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.560]   Before I introduce our speaker, I wanted to give a brief reason behind why we're doing
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.680]   this, because there was a period in church history, not that long ago, the debate over
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.640]   abortion was a Christian and non-Christian debate.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.360]   There was almost no Christian who fought for abortion rights.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:54.280]   And so as time has gone, and the church has fallen off, you know, where less and less
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.660]   churches are teaching the Bible, they're more and more illiterate, and I just read this
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:08.480]   week that according to a recent poll of professing Christians, only 6% of people who profess
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.760]   to be Christian has a Christian worldview, meaning the Bible is irrelevant in how they
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.000]   determine what is right and wrong, right?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.520]   This is among people professing to be Christians.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.880]   So we've been noticing, as our church grows, that there is more and more people who are
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.600]   coming in, wanting to debate this issue, and I've made it very clear from the pulpit that
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.400]   this is not within Christian debate, right?
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.880]   We wanted to make sure that our church understands biblically where we ought to stand biblically,
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.560]   not what you think is right, not what politically you should be thinking.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.680]   All of these things are relevant, but first and foremost, what should a Christian be thinking
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.560]   on this issue?
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.680]   And the reason why this is related to IVF and birth control is because it's almost impossible
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.900]   to debate about abortion, fight against abortion, until we have a biblical view and how that
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.280]   affects the way we view IVF, because IVF, the issues with that is related to abortion.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.940]   So if we don't deal with that issue, it bleeds into the argument against abortion.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.040]   And so that's why these things are connected, and that's why we had Pastor James, he's going
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.920]   to come and he's going to give us a lecture, a talk, a sermon, but biblically open up the
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.960]   word for us and help us to see a biblical world perspective on this.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.040]   The reason why we chose him, and we wrestled over this for quite a bit, like who should
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.080]   we ask to come?
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.080]   Should we do it?
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.280]   Should we have somebody else do it?
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.040]   But he gave a really good talk at his church on this issue, and we thought he did an excellent
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.120]   job on that, and we thought it would be beneficial for us to hear.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.480]   His teaching on this is more extensive than what he's going to be teaching today, but
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.520]   we gave him two hours, so he's kind of condensing, taking some of the stuff out.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.000]   But we asked him because I think he would be doing the best job on this particular topic,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.440]   so we asked him to come.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.840]   So as you guys know, he's one of our go-to speakers at our church if I have to go somewhere
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.640]   or if we need a guest speaker.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:24.240]   But he's the pastor, he's the founding pastor of Cross Life Bible Church, right?
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.480]   And so, again, he's a brother of ours, he's very close, I mean, he's the closest to a
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.680]   sister church that we can have, you know, nearby.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.080]   And so I know many of you already know him, but we want to give him as much time as possible.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.040]   So let's welcome Pastor James Lee.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:50.880]   All right, good, oh, you can hear me breathing.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.800]   All right, let me check, check.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   How's that?
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.600]   All right, I felt really intimate, you guys can hear my breathing.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.520]   All right, I think we're good.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.960]   Thank you, Pastor Peter, for that gracious introduction.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.640]   Thank you for the leadership at Brain Community Church for inviting me to come and to deliver
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:22.040]   God's Word and the teaching with regards to this subject on abortion and life of the unborn
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.200]   and even reproductive technology.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.120]   And I hope it is an encouragement to all of you guys.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.960]   For the sake of time, let me just open us up with a word of prayer and we'll get right
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.000]   into it.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.520]   God, we know that you are the God of life.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.960]   It's because of you that we breathe every single morning.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.560]   It's because of your grace that we are alive.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.640]   And by your grace, you have also given us new life in union with the resurrection of
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.240]   Jesus Christ.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:05.280]   And Lord, so we know if there's anybody who should be fighting for life and even proclaiming
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.840]   and heralding the message of eternal life, it is the Christian.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.080]   Grant us much grace to understand the Scriptures, give us clarity of mind, and Father, help
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:25.560]   us to be bold and courageous in a world that despises you, hates you, offends you, and
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.640]   transgresses the commandments of God.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.960]   And we be a people who fear God and not man.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.880]   Lord, thank you again for this time we have.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.760]   Thank you for everyone here who are really willing and longing to learn more about the
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760]   Scriptures.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.840]   Lord, we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.280]   >> Well, again, it is a joy to be here and to be talking about this subject today.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.920]   It's a very important subject to me, the subject of the sanctity of life.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.940]   And today, at least for this first sermon, first, I guess, lecture, it's going to be
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.640]   on when does life in personhood begin.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.760]   In order to understand how we are to approach the life within the womb, we need to first
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.040]   understand that it's a human being.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.920]   And so that's what I want to talk about this morning.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.320]   But before I do that, I feel like it's important, it's appropriate for me to share some words
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.160]   about abortion because, obviously, as Pastor Peter talked about, the subject is related.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.800]   Abortion, as many of you are aware, is not as straightforward as someone might think
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.640]   because the solution, when it comes down to abortion, is not just, "Hey, we just got
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.800]   to save the child's life."
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.640]   The reason why abortion is an issue is because, you know, the child is unwanted.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.840]   The child is unwanted for many reasons, the pressure from parents or from the boyfriend,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.200]   the fear of raising the child alone because of the abandonment from the father.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.960]   There might be financial uncertainty, absence of financial security, the cultural shame,
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.400]   right, growing up in a conservative culture.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.040]   But the reason why any of these have become a crushing burden and concern is because oftentimes
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.360]   men and women are casually having sex outside of the protective and provisional and sacred
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.240]   bonds of marriage so that if a woman finds herself to be pregnant, it's outside of the
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.760]   place of stability.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.520]   It's outside of the place of unconditional love.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.600]   But the solution is more than just a matter of addressing the problem of fornication.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.880]   It's more than just addressing the problem of sexual immorality but about preaching the
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.440]   gospel that forgives people of their sins and transforms the soul.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.280]   And for those who are suffering from the guilt and shame of abortion, we know from Scripture
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.160]   that if there is any healing, it's in the gospel.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.640]   It's in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:53.840]   If there's anybody who is fit to administer the hope of the gospel with sympathy and love,
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:01.440]   it's a Christian because Christians, we are the ones who know what it means to take an
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.720]   innocent life, right, because it was our sins that crucified our Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.960]   It was our sins that condemned him upon the cross.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.320]   It was our sins that caused him to suffer the damnation of his own father.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.180]   But in the providence of God, it is through his death that we are forgiven of our sins.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.080]   It's the forgiveness that we proclaim to those who may be suffering from the shame and the
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   guilt of having taken innocent life.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.200]   So of all people, the Christian should understand.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.120]   Of all people, we should be the herald of the message of healing and forgiveness.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:48.400]   Now, with that being said, the hope for today is to talk about the sanctity of life within
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.680]   the womb, the sanctity of life of the unborn child.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:00.440]   And after this first lecture, we're going to be talking about reproductive technology,
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.280]   specifically IVF, in vitro fertilization.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.480]   And I hope to bring some clarity to the subject today and that this would just be maybe a
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.880]   platform even for you to begin studying the subject even more.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.080]   So we're going to be talking about when life and personhood begins.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.280]   The reason why I want to talk about the subject of the beginning of human life is because
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.200]   I've come across some believers who genuinely, genuinely question when human life begins.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.320]   And this obviously affects how we think about things like the after-morning pill.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.840]   It affects the way that we approach IVF.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.100]   For the longest time, I thought the straightforward passages in scripture would be sufficient
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.380]   to establish the sanctity of the unborn baby's life.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.840]   For example, in Psalm 139 verse 13 to 14, it says, "For you formed my inward parts.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.520]   You knitted me together in my mother's womb.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.520]   I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.520]   Wonderful are your works.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.860]   My soul knows it very well."
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.280]   And so I think passages like that make it pretty obvious.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.840]   But for some, it's not enough.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.160]   They may acknowledge that the unborn child is a human being at some point of development
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.960]   within the womb, but they can't be absolutely certain that life begins at the moment of
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.560]   conception because the Bible doesn't explicitly say that life begins when the sperm meets
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.880]   the egg and fertilizes it.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.600]   Now when I hear this, I think it's pretty obvious that the burden of proof is upon the
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.920]   person who questions the humanity of the unborn child because the scripture always ascribes
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.280]   human worth to the unborn child, always.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.980]   So if a challenge is posed against the general pattern presented in scripture, if an exception
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:43.320]   or specific aspect that goes against a broader tenor of truth, then that exceptional case
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.960]   should be shown biblically.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.280]   So that again, the burden of proof is upon the individual who questions and doubts the
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.800]   broad tenor or the general teaching of the humanity of the unborn child.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.560]   Furthermore, I believe that the Bible is sufficient for many things, especially our salvation,
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.720]   but also obviously for morality.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.400]   In 2 Timothy 3.16-17, it says, "All scriptures breathed out by God and profitable for teaching,
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.720]   for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, that the man of God may
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.800]   be complete, equipped for every good work."
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   The reason why this is important is because the questioning of someone's humanity is
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.240]   not a neutral thing.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.560]   It's not a fair question.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:28.800]   I know some might say, "I don't know if a human being begins at conception, but I'll
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.760]   err on the side of safety and I'll just treat that person like a person.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.120]   I'll treat that being like a person, just in case it's a person."
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.320]   So practically, they might treat the unborn child no differently from somebody who believes
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.600]   that that child's life begins at the moment of conception, but the issue is more than
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.920]   just the matter of how we practically treat the unborn child.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.800]   It's a matter of whether or not we honor God, glorify God.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.040]   Can you imagine, given our history of slavery, going up to a black man and says, "You know
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   what?
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.040]   I don't know whether or not you are a person."
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.560]   That's not a non-offensive question.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.640]   That's not an amoral question.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.680]   To question the humanity of an individual is a sin in and of itself.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.080]   But it is a sin against the individual and a grave offense against the God whose image
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.080]   they bear.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.360]   And so to suggest that the Bible cannot give clear direction with regards to the humanity
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.840]   of a zygote practically testifies to its insufficiency in dealing with a very serious moral issue.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.520]   And so for these reasons, I believe that the straightforward passages in scripture is enough
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.000]   to believe that life begins at conception.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.480]   But regardless, my objective this morning is going to undertake the task to show biblically
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:47.160]   and logically that the child in the womb is not a potential person, that it's not a potential
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.960]   life, but it is a precious child made in the image of our God.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:14:00.320]   And that precious child begins to live at the moment of conception.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.840]   So I want to cover two points to show that life and personhood go hand in hand, that
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.880]   you cannot have one without the other.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:12.040]   The first point, life and personhood go hand in hand in creation, and life and personhood
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.000]   go hand in hand in new creation.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.200]   So that's going to be my two broad points for today.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.720]   So let's talk about how life and personhood go hand in hand in creation.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.940]   And what I mean by that is that you cannot have one without the other.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:33.160]   To have human life is to be a person, and a person is to have human life.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.200]   So in order to show that life and personhood go hand in hand, I want to cover two sub points.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:44.880]   First, an unborn child at the moment of conception is a distinct living human being.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.000]   So distinct living human being.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.240]   My second sub point is that a distinct living human being is a person.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.640]   That's how I'm going to argue my case.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.160]   So an unborn child at the moment of conception is a distinct living human being.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.720]   I want to take Hosea 12.3 as an example to launch our study.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.960]   In Hosea 12.3 it says, "In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and in his manhood
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.040]   he strove with God."
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.080]   So in the womb he took his brother by the heel.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.840]   It's talking about Jacob when he was in the womb.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.040]   Passages like this, of which there are many, we see a number of important qualities about
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.480]   Jacob, that within his mother's womb he is a distinct living human being.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.480]   Jacob is not part of his mom, he is distinct.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:37.360]   He's living, he's moving around, he just grabbed his brother's heel, he's moving around.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.360]   He's human.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:44.200]   He's not a pig, so he's a human, so he's a distinct living human being.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.280]   So let's first talk about, I want to first talk about life, life of the unborn.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.000]   In Roe v. Wade the justices speak about the fetus representing the potentiality of life,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.400]   but that statement is incorrect.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.960]   It's a nearly uncontested idea that a fertilized egg is in fact alive.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.840]   Even the sperm and the unfertilized egg before coming together is alive, right?
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.120]   You guys know that from high school biology, it's alive, it's a living cell.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.320]   As a result, there's internal dynamism within the zygote that is a fertilized egg that continues
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.800]   to grow within the womb and eventually outside of the womb until he or she finally dies.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.320]   The ethicist John Feinberg quotes Patrick Lee, a professor of bioethics, who says the
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:26.480]   following, "Once fertilization occurs, the new embryo possesses the internal resources
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.760]   and dynamism needed actively to develop himself or herself to full maturity.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.560]   And unless deprived of a suitable environment or prevented by accident or disease, this
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:41.120]   embryo will actively develop itself in its own distinct direction towards its own survival
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   and maturity."
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:49.220]   Dr. Alfred M. Bongiovanni, who is a professor of pediatrics and obstetrics at the University
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.480]   of Pennsylvania, testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee to give his
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.840]   expert opinion on when life begins.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.120]   He said the following, "I've learned from my earliest medical education that human life
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.920]   begins at the time of conception.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.680]   I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   life.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.160]   I'm no more prepared to say that these early stages of development in the womb represent
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.160]   an incomplete human being than I would be to say that the child prior to the dramatic
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.880]   effects of puberty is not a human being.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.760]   This is human life at every stage."
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.460]   So the idea that a zygote is alive is very difficult to contest considering the internal
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.440]   dynamism and the vitality, and even more so when you consider the fact that the sperm
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.780]   and, again, the sperm and the egg, which come together to make the zygote, is also alive.
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.480]   So the more precise question we should ask is not whether a zygote is life, but whether
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.180]   it's a human life.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.320]   Is it a human life?
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.520]   And this brings me to the second characteristic of the unborn.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.520]   It's humanity.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.520]   It's humanity.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.740]   The same way that people talk about the embryo being a potential life, some people make the
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.800]   argument that the embryo has the potential to be human.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.680]   I don't know if you guys heard this stuff before, right?
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.360]   The potential to be human.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.880]   But the fact is, it is human, not a potential to be human.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.880]   It's human.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.400]   The unborn child is genetically distinguishable from, like, a bat or cat or a dog, right?
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.480]   It's a human embryo, a human, therefore, life.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.520]   When we utilize a term like human, we have brought ourselves into the discussion or framework
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:34.360]   about creational types or species or kinds, the nature of what type of thing that creation
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.360]   is.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.460]   To be human is a categorical description of a kind.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.200]   That is a kind of being.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:46.000]   We are mankind or humankind, as opposed to a kind of dog or a kind of cat.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.280]   Now, when we talk about the potentiality, we're talking about precursors to what something
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.080]   might become.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.800]   To have the potentiality to become a thing means that it has yet to become that thing.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.280]   Correct?
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.280]   Right?
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.640]   To have the potentiality to become a thing means that it has yet to become that thing.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.240]   But because the embryo is human, there is no potentiality.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.960]   It's not a—again, it's a human sperm that comes together with a human egg.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.040]   The product is a human embryo.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.000]   What would it actually mean for something to be potentially human?
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.360]   Like, what is that thing?
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.660]   We're not talking about inorganic material that somehow evolves into a human being.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.080]   We're definitely not talking about a cow becoming a human being.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.520]   What does it mean to be the potential to be human?
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.080]   It's a nonsensical term.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.880]   It is human from the get-go so that there is no potentiality.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.520]   It is human.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:50.360]   The last characteristic is whether the living human cell is distinct from the mother.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.880]   As many of you know, it is.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.680]   What is growing in the mother's womb is not something that is part of the mother.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.040]   The child within the womb is not a tumor.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.640]   The child within the womb is not another foot or a fingernail that has attached itself to
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.440]   the uterine lining.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.760]   It is another being that is growing.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.400]   Even genetically, the child has a different DNA blueprint that is distinct from the mother.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:21.180]   And this distinction is obvious when we see the child grow within the mother's womb.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.160]   And so it's clear that the unborn child is a distinct living human being.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.520]   To claim that it has the potential for life is blatantly incorrect.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.480]   The idea that it has the potential to become human is nonsensical.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.640]   And it's obvious that the embryo is not a part of the mother.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.140]   It is its own unique being.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.120]   So what is true of Jacob in Hosea chapter 12 is true of a child the moment he or she
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.920]   is conceived.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.200]   So I think here's the fair question then.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.960]   Is it a person?
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.960]   Is it a person?
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.360]   Are you guys tracking with me?
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.360]   Yeah?
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.360]   Yeah?
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.680]   Okay, are you guys tracking with me?
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   All right.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.560]   So sometimes it's kind of like, anyway, okay, good.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.560]   All right.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:15.000]   So does the embryo have the potential to become a person?
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.800]   And that, I would say, is a good question.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.320]   Another way to understand it, is there a time of bodily development of the child when the
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.320]   soul enters into the physical body?
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:29.480]   Is it like the body being formed within the womb and the soul comes in in three months,
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   four months, five months?
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.320]   Or is the soul knit into the body the moment that it is formed at conception?
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:47.640]   And so we come to my second sub-point, that a distinct living human being is a person.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:54.000]   The question of personhood is philosophical in nature or theological or metaphysical.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.500]   And the reason is because we're talking about what it means to be a person.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:02.020]   And this is not only relevant when talking about the unborn, but it's a question that
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.960]   needs to be addressed when we're talking about issues like slavery or genocide, where people
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.760]   are dehumanized.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:14.580]   What we see is that because the question of personhood is philosophical, theological,
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:19.560]   or metaphysical in nature, people cannot objectively determine what makes a person a person.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:25.040]   So you see a lot of confusion in the secular society.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.920]   Mary Ann Warren was a professor of philosophy at SF State University, and she believed that
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.720]   personhood was determined by five criteria.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.600]   She said the following, "I suggest that the traits which are most central to the concept
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.480]   of personhood or humanity in the moral sense are very roughly the following, consciousness
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.760]   of objects and events external and/or internal to the being, and in particular, the capacity
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.760]   to feel pain."
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.520]   Two, reasoning, the developed capacity to solve new and relatively complex problems.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:57.680]   Three, self-motivated activity, activity which is relatively independent of either genetic
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.920]   or direct external control.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.880]   Four, the capacity to communicate by whatever means messages of an indefinite variety of
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.640]   types, that is, not just with an indefinite number of possible contents, but on indefinitely
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.320]   many possible topics.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:18.720]   Five, the presence of self-concepts and self-awareness, either individual or racial or both.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.240]   So this is her criteria to determine whether a human life is a person.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.840]   Now immediately you can see how troubling this criteria is, because a newborn child
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.640]   or a severely mentally disabled person cannot meet this criteria.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.800]   But it's not only these criteria that is the problem.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:41.240]   You have to wonder on what authority she can even assert these qualities to be determinative
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.800]   of personhood in the first place.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.920]   At the end of the day, these are just subjective assertions of what makes a person a person.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.120]   In other words, she just made it up.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.720]   She just made it up.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.680]   She says this is the criteria for personhood, what says who?
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.880]   Her.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.000]   And if the criteria for personhood could be made up, then anyone in power can just make
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.320]   up whatever he wants to establish as the boundaries of personhood and dehumanize anybody who falls
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.480]   outside of that boundary in order to enslave them, to abuse them, and to kill these subhuman,
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.360]   inferior subhuman beings.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.520]   What if someone said that personhood is determined by skin color?
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.520]   That's the boundary.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.560]   Isn't that what we have done in the past of this country?
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.680]   Or what if someone says that personhood is determined by the stage of development?
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   That's the boundary.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.720]   And that's exactly what we're doing in the present as a nation.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:36.880]   In California, a child can be aborted until fetal viability, which is about 24 to 26 weeks.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.760]   In Nebraska, a child can be aborted until 12 weeks.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.320]   In Utah, 18 weeks.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.320]   In Oregon, there are no restrictions, no restrictions.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.320]   But things get even more extreme.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.600]   I mean, that alone is shocking.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.520]   There's an article in the Journal of Medical Ethics published in 2012 by Gubalini and Minerva
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.720]   entitled "After-Birth Abortion, Why Should the Baby Live?"
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.480]   The writers argue that we should not only have the right to kill the child within the
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:06.080]   womb, but they argue that we should be able to kill the child outside of the womb.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.080]   This is the abstract to the paper.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.800]   This is what it reads.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.360]   Abortion is largely accepted even for reasons that do not have anything to do with the fetus's
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.360]   health.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.440]   By showing that, one, both fetus and newborns do not have the same moral status as actual
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.440]   persons.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.600]   Two, the fact that both are potential persons is morally irrelevant.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.040]   And three, adoptions is not always in the best interest of actual people.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.600]   The authors argue that what we call after-birth abortion, killing a newborn, should be permissible
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.520]   in all the cases where abortion is, including cases where the newborn is not disabled.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:43.040]   These guys are basically saying that newborn children, like unborn children, do not have
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:50.600]   the right to life because it doesn't matter whether they are persons, potential persons.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.000]   So they say, "What does it mean to be a person?"
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.240]   They go on to say, "Both a fetus and a newborn certainly are human beings and potential persons,
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.620]   but neither is a person in the sense of subject of a moral right to life.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:06.040]   We take persons to mean an individual who is capable of attributing to her own existence
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.600]   some at least basic values such that being deprived of this existence represents a loss
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.600]   to her."
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.660]   They're saying a human being becomes a person when they become aware of his own value as
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.060]   an individual.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.520]   And since a newborn child, like an unborn child, is not aware or self-aware of its own
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.920]   existence by thinking, "Hey, my life is important.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:31.180]   Hey, I'm here," they do not have a right to live.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.440]   This is crazy.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:39.000]   You see how this line of thinking, if you draw it out to its logical end, it leads us
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.600]   to a very, very, very dark place.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:49.120]   Even now it's a dark place, but we have become accustomed to the dark, sadly.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.480]   Without God, people are just making up what constitutes personhood.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.100]   They're just making it up.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.240]   So that some people are saying that children outside of the womb can even be killed.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.320]   And Guglielmini and Minerva are not the only ones who think this way.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:07.300]   There's a Washington Post article that came out, and it said this, "Accordingly, from
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.400]   Should the Baby Live, it does not seem wise to add to the burden on limited resources
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.960]   by increasing the number of severely disabled children."
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:22.840]   Also in that book, Singer and his colleague Helga Kuss suggested a period of 28 days after
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.200]   birth might be allowed before an infant is accepted as having the same right to live
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   as others.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:32.480]   Singer, I believe, was a professor at Princeton University.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.320]   Now, the reason why people are floundering in the dark and trying to answer when personhood
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.920]   begins unable to reach a consensus is because the question, again, is philosophical in nature.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:46.120]   It is theological or metaphysical, so that an answer cannot be determined and discovered
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.300]   from the natural order.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.920]   It cannot be assessed through our senses.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:56.040]   It must be revealed to us, and it has been revealed to us from God himself, the source
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.520]   of our life in personhood.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.660]   And so, of course, to answer the question, we must go to the Bible.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.860]   We have to go to the Bible, and what we see from scripture is that personhood is not determined
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.040]   by a stage of development, it's not determined by your skin color, it's not determined by
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:17.400]   social acceptance or a mother's choice, but whether or not a creature is made in the image
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   of God.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.480]   In Genesis chapter 1, verse 26 to 27, take your Bibles, turn with me there.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:43.560]   Genesis chapter 1, verse 26 to 27.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:50.680]   Genesis chapter 1, verse 26 to 27, this is the reading of God's word, "Then God said,
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.760]   'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.540]   the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the livestock, and over
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.080]   all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.'
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.320]   So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.320]   he created them."
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:14.460]   To be an image bearer of God is a loaded idea, so that it's difficult to come up with
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.600]   a narrow definition.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:20.720]   The accurate understanding of this term is probably the most general.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.520]   The accurate understanding of this term is probably the most general, which is to be
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.320]   like God.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:32.360]   And who God is, is a personal being expressed in the person of the Father, the Son, and
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.480]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.560]   And also we know that God is a living God.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.680]   In Psalm 42 verse 2 it says, "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God."
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.020]   In 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse 13 it says, "I charge you in the presence of God who gives
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.600]   life to all things."
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.180]   And so to be made in the image of God is to be a living person.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:55.940]   And just as God's nature, personhood, and life, though distinguishable, is not separable,
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.280]   so we as image bearers of God share in the distinguishable, though not separable, unity
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.740]   of the realities of our nature, personhood, and life that God has communicated to us.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.680]   And that's why throughout the Bible we see personhood identified with distinct human
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.940]   life.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.640]   This is demonstrated to us in Genesis chapter 2, where we see personhood the moment that
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.320]   God breathed life into Adam.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.000]   In Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 it says, "And the Lord God formed the man of dust from the
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.880]   ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living creature."
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:31.680]   And so Adam is alive, but he's not some unprogrammed robot, right?
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.920]   What do we see in the following verses?
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.160]   We see personal interactions of a person.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.600]   In Genesis chapter 2 verse 15 to 17 it says, "The Lord God took the man and put him in
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.640]   the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.040]   And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, 'You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.520]   but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day you
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.800]   eat of it you shall surely die.'"
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:57.520]   So God speaks to him, commands him.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.900]   What we find from Scripture is that we find both life and personhood in God, who has breathed
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.800]   into us, which makes sense because God is alive and he is a person, in fact three persons
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.280]   in one.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.680]   As a result, the identity between personhood and life is something that we observe throughout
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.960]   all of Scripture.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:20.000]   There's absolutely no case in the Bible, absolutely none, where an individual is alive but is
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.820]   not considered a person.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.840]   No case in the Bible.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.800]   And so to make a divorce between life and personhood is something that is alien to what
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.400]   we find in Scripture, and specifically what it means to be an image bearer of Yahweh.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.200]   And we see the relationship between personhood and life at the end of life.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:45.480]   A corpse has the DNA information to show that it is a distinct human corpse, right?
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.320]   Not a distinct human life, but a distinct human corpse.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.800]   It is human, it is distinct.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.720]   But we do not treat that human corpse as a person, why?
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.320]   Because it does not have life.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.040]   The fact that it has no life means that the person is gone, that it's a soul.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.160]   You can technically hit it, you can make fun of a corpse, it's not going to respond.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.520]   You can bury a corpse and it's not a crime, whereas if you bury a living person, a living
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:15.960]   human being, it is a crime, it's a crime against that person.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.400]   So death is a reverse parallel of the creation account.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.000]   In creation there is the body, or a pile of dirt, we don't know the actual composition
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.040]   of that human shell, but then it's when God breathes life into that body, right, into
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:33.440]   the individual, breathes life into the individual that it has life and personhood.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.680]   And when the breath of life leaves the body, the person departs from the body.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   From thus we came to thus we shall return.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:45.760]   And I think it's relevant to mention just because a man dies physically, his vitality
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.560]   is not extinguished.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.600]   That is really interesting too.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.120]   The life energy of his existence continues in the form of a soul.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.680]   And again what we see is that where there is a human vitality, I guess you can say human
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.240]   life energy, there is personhood.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.320]   In Revelation chapter 6 verse 9-10 it says, "When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.520]   the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.600]   they had borne.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.560]   They cried out with a loud voice, 'O sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.440]   judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?'"
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:21.680]   So I saw under the altar the souls of those who have been slain.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:29.680]   So vitality, whether bodily or solely, immaterially, vitality and personhood is identified with
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.200]   one another.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.160]   To suggest therefore that the soul comes into the shell of the human flesh in the unborn
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:40.960]   child at later stages of development is incompatible with the biblical data because vitality begins
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.100]   at conception.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.960]   The moment the egg is fertilized, it begins to divide.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.120]   And where there is vitality, as we have seen, there is personhood.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.960]   And that is true from the beginning of life to the end of life.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.300]   John Feinberg quotes William B. Hurlburt, who is a senior research scholar in neurobiology
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:01.600]   at Stanford Medical School, and he says the following, it's an extended quote, so bear
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.600]   with me, as Hurlburt adds, "Unlike an assembly of parts in which a manufactured product is
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.400]   in no sense present until there is a completed construction, a living being has a continuous
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.360]   unfolding existence that is inseparable from its emerging form.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.720]   The form is itself a dynamic process rather than a static structure.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:26.280]   In biology, the whole, as a unified organismal principle of growth, precedes and produces
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.280]   the parts.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:33.440]   Thus, to interfere in the embryo's development is to transgress a life in process.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.040]   Hence the notion that at some point in the development of the fertilized egg, the embryo,
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.560]   it is not a human being and that it later does become one contradicts the fact that
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:49.680]   a continuous process begins at fertilization and runs the whole course of the new organism's
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.680]   life.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:54.680]   One, of course, can arbitrarily draw a line of various points in the gestation process
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:35:01.320]   and say that before that point it isn't a human entity or being an after that point
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.320]   it is.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.680]   But it's hard to defend any particular drawing of such a line when any drawing would be arbitrary.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.680]   The only line that can be drawn and supported on objective grounds is a line between sperm
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:17.700]   and egg as distinct entities unconnected to one another and the point when the sperm fertilizes
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.700]   the egg.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:24.200]   The developmental process doesn't exist before fertilization and after fertilization it never
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.400]   stops until the new organism dies.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:39.360]   That is a difference that is objectively measurable and it is a difference that makes a difference.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.960]   Neither sperm nor egg alone can generate the developmental process that leads to a baby
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.560]   but an embryo can does.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.080]   Since the developmental process is continuous once it begins and since it is generated and
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.400]   governed from within the new organism there seems to be no objective grounds for thinking
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:01.040]   the embryo is a human being at some point in its development but not others.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:05.680]   Feinberg quotes Herbert again and he says the following, "Zygote, morula, embryo, fetus,
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.400]   child and adult, these are conceptual constructions for convenience of description, not distinct
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.760]   ontological categories.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.240]   With respect to fundamental moral status, therefore, the human being is an embodied
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.760]   being whose intrinsic dignity is inseparable from its full procession of life and always
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:26.920]   present in its various stages of emergence."
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.680]   One of the reasons why I believe there might be confusion as to the personhood and the
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.660]   humanity of the unborn child is because we have made scientific classifications for certain
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.160]   stages of fetal development, points of growth that we can demarcate and label.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.080]   And so to ponder the question of personhood and to anchor it in the label points of development
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:47.120]   seems to have an air of scientific legitimacy but we fail to see that the scientifically
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:54.620]   labeled points of development are themselves anchored in nothing but categorizations whose
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.520]   lines are arbitrarily drawn.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.720]   In other words, people are anchoring personhood in something that is not anchored in it of
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.720]   itself.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.960]   And the categories are not categories of ontological differences.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.240]   They're not differences of beings in essence.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.520]   We're not like cow in week one and we become a monkey week two and then we finally become
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.840]   a human being in week three.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:23.060]   The categories are not categories of ontological differences or essential differences, differences
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:27.560]   of nature, differences of being, but they are differences of development.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.320]   They're developmental differences.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.120]   The procession of distinct human life begins at the moment of fertilization and it continues
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:42.000]   indivisible, uninterrupted until the day that we die.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.500]   And so when David praises God for his development within the womb of his mother, it begins with
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.920]   the initial point of development that is conception.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.720]   For you form my inward parts, you knitted me together in my mother's womb.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.920]   I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, wonderful are your works, my soul knows
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:03.680]   it very well.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:12.600]   So distinct human life is a person from beginning to end.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.800]   This relationship between life and personhood doesn't just have practical implications
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:22.280]   but practical implications for how we should look at the unborn, but it also established
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:27.160]   a prototypical framework for our salvation as a part of the new creation.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.780]   What I mean by this is that relationship between personhood and life as we see it in Genesis
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.340]   sets the pattern with how we experience new life and the renewal of who we are as a person
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.560]   in Christ.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:41.600]   Just as we identify life and personhood in the first creation, so we identify new life
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.240]   and renewed personhood in the new creation.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:50.480]   So we come to my second point, life and personhood go hand in hand in the new creation.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:56.800]   So the relationship of life and personhood as we find it in Genesis establishes prototypical
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:02.920]   framework of our salvation with respects to the new creation.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:10.240]   In Genesis chapter 2 verse 7, it says this, "Then the Lord God formed the man of dust
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.480]   from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.480]   creature."
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:22.320]   Now in that text the word breath is from the Hebrew word neshama.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.640]   But there is another word for breath, you may have heard it, ruach.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:33.800]   And that word ruach can also be translated as spirit or as in the spirit of God.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.520]   So we get this relationship between the breath of life that God has breathed into man and
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.760]   the spirit of God that gives life to man.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.280]   I think this is super cool theologically, okay.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:50.640]   So listen to this, Job chapter 27 verse 3, "As long as my breath, neshama, is in me,
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:58.360]   and the spirit, ruach, of God is in my nostrils," Psalm 104 verse 30 says, "When you send forth
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:04.400]   your spirit, ruach, they are created and you renew the face of the ground."
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:10.120]   What might not be obvious in Genesis 1 and 2 is made clear through progressive revelation
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:16.720]   that we are the image bearers of God because God breathed his spirit into us to make us
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.340]   like him.
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:24.280]   So we are the image bearers of God because God breathed his spirit into us.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.920]   But as you know, sin has corrupted the nature of man and marred the image of God within
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.920]   us.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:36.840]   So there was moral decay, and as a result we came to know death.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.880]   So a person, a man, would be morally twisted because of sin.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.160]   They would become hostile to God, naturally suppressing the truth in his unrighteousness.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.200]   But the effects of the sin didn't just morally corrupt the person, it also killed his life.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:56.120]   For with sin came death, so that the immoral life that we live would be a life that is
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:02.520]   dying unto death, even death in the lake of fire.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:07.560]   But the Lord in his grace chose to restore fallen nature of humanity, the marred image
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:13.400]   of God, to make us new, to save us from death and the moral corruption of sin.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:18.920]   And just as he breathed his breath into man in the first creation to make him the image
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:24.080]   of God, so God breathed out his spirit unto man in a new creation.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:29.320]   In John chapter 20 verse 22, okay, it says this, "And when he had said this, he breathed
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:36.280]   unto them and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.'
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:42.880]   The work of the Spirit in the new creation will not be as it is in the old, for the Spirit
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.240]   of God will intimately unite us with the Son of God in an inextricable, inseparable, intimate
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:54.000]   bond, a union with the resurrected Christ that restores the image of God within us."
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.480]   So what we have in the book of Genesis is that God breathed life into man so that man
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.760]   was made in the image of God.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.920]   Sin corrupted that image.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.000]   And so what does Jesus do when he comes back, right?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.920]   It says here, "He breathed on them and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.'"
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.720]   And what the Holy Spirit does is that he unites us with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.360]   Jesus Christ in Colossians chapter 1 verse 15 says he is the image of the invisible God.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:24.120]   Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God, right?
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   And so, for the Holy Spirit who is breathed into us unites us with the image of the invisible
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   God.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:34.760]   By being united with the image of the invisible God, the image of God that has been marred
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.600]   at the fall is fully restored.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.680]   And that's why in Colossians chapter 3 verse 10 it says, "Have put on the new self which
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:45.640]   is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator."
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.320]   In Christ we have been remade in the image of God and the renewal was not simply a restoration
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.400]   what was lost in Eden, but an elevation from it.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.080]   First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 45 to 49 says, "Thus it is written, 'The first man
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.780]   Adam became a living being.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.120]   The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.'
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.000]   But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the natural, and then the spiritual.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.640]   The first man was from earth, the man of dust; the second man is from heaven.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.680]   As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.840]   And as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.120]   Just as we are born the image of man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.280]   heaven."
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:25.240]   The new life that we have is not a return back to the old, but an escalation towards
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.120]   something that is greater.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:32.000]   So it says in 2 Corinthians 5 verse 17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.560]   The old has passed; behold, the new has come."
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:39.120]   In Christ the image of God has been fully restored so that what was lost to sin, our
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:44.400]   moral innocence, and our life was regained, and not only regained, but upgraded to a righteousness
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.360]   and eternal life that would be impervious to sin.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.600]   Before it was innocence, now we have righteousness.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.440]   Before it was life, now we have eternal life.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.680]   To be united with the resurrected Christ is to experience the life of the resurrection.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.760]   Just as the Spirit of God made Adam a living creature, so the Spirit of God made us, who
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:08.000]   were once dead in our trespasses, a living creature, born again in union with the resurrected
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.960]   Christ.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:16.040]   The life we live is a life eternal, but the resurrection life of Jesus Christ is eternal.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:20.800]   In John 14 verse 19, Jesus says, "Because I live, you also will live."
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.000]   In Ephesians chapter 2 verse 5, it says, "Even when we were dead and our trespasses made
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.320]   us alive together with Christ, by grace you have been saved."
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:33.840]   We are alive because Christ lives, but to be united with the resurrected Christ is not
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:40.320]   only to experience the life of Christ, it's also to experience the person of the resurrection,
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:45.820]   that is Jesus, so that we are transformed to be like Jesus himself, so that in him we
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:51.200]   are a new man, with a renewed mind and a renewed heart.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:56.760]   Our old self is dead upon the cross, and a new self has risen from the grave.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.860]   We have been born again.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.240]   First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 to 15 says, "The natural person does not accept
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:07.640]   the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.840]   them because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:15.040]   The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one."
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.840]   First Corinthians chapter 4 verse 16, "So we do not lose heart, though our outer self
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:23.720]   is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day."
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.920]   Galatians 2 20, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:32.200]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.000]   Just as God breathed his Spirit into man to make him a living person in the first creation,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.480]   so he breathed his Holy Spirit to make us a renewed person with eternal life in the
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.560]   new creation."
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.280]   So from the beginning to the end, the life that has been endowed to us has always been
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.280]   expressed through personhood.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.300]   So that in the beginning, it's a person who lived.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.360]   After the fall, it was a person who was dying, and upon the resurrection, it is a person
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.400]   who lives again.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:06.200]   So that where there is life, there is a person, and when there is death, the person is gone.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.360]   So the beginning of new life of a child within the womb of a mother is not a life whose personhood
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.120]   is to be sacrilegiously questioned for, even that child bears the image of God, the living
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.520]   God, the God of three persons.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.440]   The glory and the sanctity of human life in the first creation is the foundation and the
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:24.020]   framework for the new life that we have in Christ, the new creation where we are given
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:29.720]   a new nature and eternal life which coincides with a renewed heart and mind that loves God.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.560]   We are a new person, so to speak.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.640]   The same way that God breathed life into Adam to bring him into existence, so the Lord in
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.360]   the moment we came to faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ breathed into us a new life
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.480]   through his Spirit.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:47.920]   We cannot deny personhood that is essential in the distinct human life of a child any
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.640]   more than we can deny the renewed personhood that is identified with the new eternal life
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.560]   that we have in the resurrected Christ.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:01.160]   Life therefore is sacred, for where there is life, there is personhood, a man, woman,
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:07.920]   or child who bears the image of the living God.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:13.240]   All that to say, the baby in the womb is a baby, okay?
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.880]   That's the point of the sermon.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.120]   All right, let's pray.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.320]   Father, thank you for your grace.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.480]   It's time we can enter into the study.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:29.520]   I know a lot of information was said, but the beauty of your truth, O God, is that even
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:36.760]   with its complexity, there's a simplicity that is easy to just know, that God, you made
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.520]   us in our mother's womb.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:46.400]   We are wonderfully and fearfully made.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.480]   God, thank you for giving us life, and thank you, Lord, even though we like fools have
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:58.080]   sinned against you, even though we have inherited the curse of Adam, you made us a new creation.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.400]   God, you've given us new life.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:08.200]   God, you renewed our mind and our hearts so that the old self is crucified and our new
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.640]   self is being renewed day by day into the image of Jesus Christ.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:21.200]   Again, Lord, I pray that for all the members here, we will stand in awe of your grace and
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:26.640]   your goodness in the life that you give to us, that we will guard it, we will protect
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:33.200]   it, and more so, we will proclaim the message that renews it and restores the image of God
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.920]   that was marred at the fall.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:46.020]   Lord, thank you again for our time together, Lord, we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:55.520]   All right, it's 9.54, and we're going to take a break until 10.05, okay, so we're going
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.640]   to get back together a little bit earlier because we wanted to save more time for later
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.640]   when we have Q&A.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:06.060]   The Q&A is not going to be an open Q&A where we're going to have an open mic, people come
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:10.000]   and ask questions for the sake of time.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.880]   We don't want the time to be just kind of dictated anywhere we go.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:19.760]   We already have some questions that we will ask, but if you have a question that really,
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:27.280]   really want us to address or Pastor James or any of the other leaders to try to address,
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.680]   you can, like, if you text it to me, I'm not going to be able to read it, you're going
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:35.200]   to have to write it on paper and put it next to me in large letters in order for me to
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   read it.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.880]   Or text one of the pastors, and if they feel like this is something that maybe we need
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.200]   to address that we don't already have, then maybe it'll come through that.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.040]   But we're not going to have open, we're not going to just have any questions because we
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.160]   just won't have time.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.640]   So we'll address that later, okay?
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:54.680]   And so after the second session, we'll take a short break, set up the Q&A, and we'll try
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.920]   to address some of these issues.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:01.280]   So for now, we'll take a 10-minute break and 10.05, we're going to start right at 10.05,
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.280]   okay?
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.960]   So you can go to the bathroom, you can leave your stuff there, go to the bathroom, go get
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:14.000]   some coffee, do whatever you need to do, but 10.05, we're going to get started, okay?
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.960]   Thank you.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.960]   [end]
