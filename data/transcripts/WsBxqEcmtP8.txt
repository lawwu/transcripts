[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   >> Hello, everyone.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.760]   Let's get into our next session.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.900]   I'd like to introduce our ACE moderator here, Karen D'Amato.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.780]   You'll be seeing her on several sessions throughout the conference.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.460]   Karen is joining us on a volunteer basis.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.940]   She has been a great addition to our Bogleheads team over the years,
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.480]   and we're so happy to have her here.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.460]   Karen is very good at asking questions.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:37.040]   And it's probably not surprising because she has had a long, fabulous career asking questions
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.100]   and answering questions and reporting on financial matters.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.720]   She was an assistant managing editor at Time Money Brand, and before that,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.960]   spent more than 30 years as a writer and editor at the Wall Street Journal.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.260]   She's now the content manager of a major New York law firm and has graciously donated her time
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.180]   to be here and to moderate a number of sessions for us.
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.780]   So, Karen, I'll let you take it from here.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.800]   [ Applause ]
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.340]   >> Well, thank you all.
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.820]   Very wonderful to see so many people here, to see so many first-time Bogleheads attendees.
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.680]   Thank you to Bill and Jason for kicking us off with an amazing session.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.600]   Two incredibly smart, thoughtful people who made us laugh a lot as well,
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.340]   who shared a lot, which we appreciate.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.820]   I'm enjoying towering over Jason Zweig.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.500]   I don't think I've ever had that experience before.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.100]   So, for our panel on investing, we welcome back Bill and Jason.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.680]   >> I'm the ringer.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:57.060]   >> And you know our other panelists as well, but let me take a moment to introduce them as well.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.580]   Rick has worked in the investment industry for about 35 years.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.900]   He is the founder and CEO of Ferry Investment Solutions, which serves individuals
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.880]   on a fixed rate and hourly fee basis.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.440]   He's written several books and is the current president
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.600]   of the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.740]   And Jim Dolley is our second outstanding representative from the medical community.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.640]   Jim is an emergency room doctor, a writer, a speaker.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.320]   He started the White Coat Investor website in 2011 to provide investing
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.840]   and personal finance advice to the medical community.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.200]   And yesterday, many of you heard Jim as the host and a panelist at Bogleheads University.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.640]   He was very busy for a good chunk of the day.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.700]   This is a little intimidating, starting a panel on investing after the setup we got from Bill
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.560]   and Jason talking about how many errors people make in looking at the markets
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.940]   and in our own emotions and trying to make sense of what's going on outside
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.600]   and then bringing it back to our personal portfolios.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.520]   I think it's fascinating that we're having this conversation.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.640]   We did a panel, oh, about 15 months ago, maybe a little more, a year and a half ago,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.920]   when the major questions we got from people, attendees ahead of time were
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.460]   about stock prices are so high, I can't find any bargains,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.160]   bond yields are so low, what am I going to do?
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.660]   So obviously, we have a very different environment now to talk about.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.500]   And many of us should be gleeful.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.460]   Whether we really truly feel gleeful is another story.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.740]   So just looking at the environment we find ourselves in, a year of steep losses across stocks
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:04.320]   and bonds around the globe, high inflation, possible recession, just big picture,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.640]   how should I be thinking about the environment we find ourselves in?
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   And Bill, why don't you kick us off because you went halfway there in the previous session?
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.420]   >> Well, let me get the other half of the way there and say that I'm as optimistic now
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.960]   as I have been in a long time.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.780]   Why? Because if you're an accumulator, you can buy stocks cheaply now, okay, for the most part,
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.460]   not all of them, but a lot of sectors are very inexpensive.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.940]   And if you're a geezer, and you don't have any human capital left, you can now,
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.240]   as I said earlier, de-fees your future liabilities, your future living,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.520]   real living expenses with very plump tips yields.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.900]   Now, you know, I think things may actually be worse on the short term than we think they are.
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.760]   I mean, I think there's a good chance we're looking at a new global financial crisis.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.240]   But the market already knows that.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.300]   Okay, that's why it's going down 25%.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.760]   During a real financial crisis, markets go down 50%.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.280]   Well, what the 25% fall in the market is telling you is
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.240]   that the market thinks there's a 50% probability of that.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.560]   And if it doesn't occur, market's going to rebound.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.620]   And if it does occur, it's going to go down, but not an awful lot more.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.880]   >> I have two announcements that I was told during the break.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.020]   Social security will increase by 8.7%.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.800]   That's the CPI, or the inflation increase next year.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:42.960]   I bonds, the number we've all been waiting for, will be 6.48,
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.980]   basically the inflation rate with no interest.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:53.000]   But still, getting back to Bill's point, I like to look at things.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.080]   I wish that the market never went up a lot in 2021.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.860]   And I wish that real estate didn't go up a lot.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.060]   And I wish that NFTs and cryptocurrencies and all of these things,
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.580]   this speculation that occurred in there didn't happen.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.720]   And that stock prices didn't go up 20-some odd percent in 2021.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.460]   Because if they didn't, then where would we be today based
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.840]   on where things were at the end of 2020?
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.420]   And we'd all be looking, saying, ah, things aren't really too bad.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.080]   I mean, the market's up a little bit.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.860]   Interest rates are maybe up a little bit, but not too bad.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.460]   But what happened was not what's happening this year.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.600]   What's happening this year is everybody's focusing
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.100]   on what happened from January until today.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.820]   Stocks went down, bond interest rates went up, bond prices went down.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.660]   Of course, crypto and everything else, everything speculative went down.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.380]   But if you started this whole evolution two years ago, and you said, well,
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.520]   where are we from two years ago, you'd have a whole different opinion.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.480]   So if you were able to do the Rip Van Winkle thing, invested two years ago and just look
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.720]   at where we are today, it would be kind of a non-event.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.380]   This conversation, this question wouldn't even come up.
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.840]   >> Fair enough.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.700]   Let's talk a little bit more about the U.S. stock market.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:17.680]   So when you look at the market, are there areas of the market that are still overvalued?
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.660]   And where do you see the greatest opportunities, areas that seem most undervalued?
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.220]   >> Well, that's a tough question.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.740]   Overvalued and undervalued is in the eye of the beholder.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.500]   And the truth is that the market is probably smarter than any of us individually.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.960]   And so theoretically, it's never overvalued or undervalued.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.380]   And it's a tough question you're asking because you're saying in the U.S. market,
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.440]   what do you see as being undervalued or overvalued?
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:55.260]   And when I start looking for value, the U.S. market is not where I look these days.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.020]   >> I mean, I would just echo what Jim said.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.900]   I mean, I think international markets
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.360]   on a relative basis are a lot more attractive than the U.S.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.240]   >> And I think there are a lot of people in the audience who would be happy to hear that.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.680]   You know, we got a number, we got questions from people
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:20.520]   about a perennial Fogelhead's question of investing in, can you just invest in U.S. stocks
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.860]   or should you also have international stock exposure?
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.160]   One of the questions from the audience was,
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.960]   will international equities ever outperform U.S. equities or even equal perform?
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.540]   >> That's an easy question.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.640]   The answer to that is yes.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.260]   The hard question to answer is when.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.340]   You'll all remember, well, maybe you won't all remember, but you should remember
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.440]   if you've been a student of market history, as Bill has recommended you be,
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.380]   a decade we called the lost decade was not that long ago
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.080]   in which people all said U.S. stocks stink.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.300]   Why would you invest in U.S. stocks?
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.680]   U.S. stocks haven't returned anything in a decade.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.660]   It wasn't that long ago.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.800]   And now I'm hearing the exact same thing about international.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.880]   Well, what did great the last 10 years?
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.120]   U.S. stocks did.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.220]   You know, Jack Bogle was always saying the pendulum swings back and forth.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.680]   It returns to the mean.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.060]   And it tends to do that.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:21.100]   You don't know exactly when, but over time, every asset class has its day in the sun.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.960]   And you want to be in it when it has its day in the sun.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.720]   And the only way to really do that is to own it in the long term.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.860]   >> And in the stock market in particular, staying in the stock market,
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:38.040]   do you recommend investing with a total stock market dollar weighted type approach
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.660]   or do you tilt your portfolios, large, small, growth value?
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:48.840]   >> Well, just to, you know, put a point on it,
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.700]   obsessing over precisely what your asset allocation is.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.300]   Do you tilt?
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:52.900]   Don't you tilt?
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.940]   How much international?
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.960]   How much U.S.?
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.820]   That pales in importance to the question, how disciplined are you?
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:05.360]   In other words, sticking with your asset allocation is far more important
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.400]   than picking the right one, and so the wrong thing to do right now would be
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   if you did have a total, if you did have a significant foreign allocation,
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.640]   would be to abandon it right now at a 55, 45 probability.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.200]   That's probably a bad bet.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.600]   >> So I'd write it up or make the analogy between a cake,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.780]   the icing on the cake, and the decorations on the cake.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.800]   Okay, we tend to focus on the decorations, right?
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.040]   What's going up now, what's not going up now?
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.260]   The icing on the cake is should you have small value, should you have more international,
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.940]   should you have international, what the real thing that you eat
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:51.440]   and that you bring it home with you, what really matters is your asset allocation
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.520]   between risky and non-risky assets, the thing that Bill was talking about earlier.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:02.200]   This drives 90% of your return, 90% of the variability of your portfolio.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.080]   How much you have in safe assets, how much you have in risky assets.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.860]   Everything else after that, these are icing on the cake, such as how much in international,
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.940]   how much in U.S., what factors you have, if you decide to have factors,
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.980]   and then there's the sprinkles, which seems to be the thing that occupy a lot of time.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.660]   This is the cryptocurrencies and all of these other things that really don't matter.
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.980]   They're sort of shooting stars, but we spend an awful lot of time looking
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.080]   at shooting stars rather than the ingredients that go in the cake.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.080]   >> Let's talk about the bond market some.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.180]   We had a number of questions from the audience about bonds.
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:45.340]   One was a request for your views on the choice of duration and quality and your rationale.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.400]   So short treasuries versus intermediate treasuries versus total bond.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:55.020]   And similar, a question is, is total bond funds still considered good enough
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.140]   for the bond portion of a 60/40 portfolio for a retiree?
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.960]   >> Yes.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.720]   >> Now it is.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:11.300]   >> I'm a big fan of staying pretty safe with bonds.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:16.280]   I tend to take my risk on the equity side, and I take a lot of risk there.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.980]   And so I tend to be pretty safe on the bond side.
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:26.060]   I've divided my bonds into nominal and inflation indexed bonds, 50/50.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.960]   And the nominal ones, if I could, would all be in the safest bond investment I know of,
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.240]   which is the TSPG fund.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:42.560]   My entire TSP from my time in the federal service is in the G fund, which is basically,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.440]   you know, bond yields with money market risk.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.000]   Hasn't been the right investment for the last 16 years until this year,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.320]   but this year it's the right investment.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.840]   It's a great investment.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.940]   But it's not risky at all.
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.700]   It's a very safe investment.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:02.000]   And then on the inflation index side, it's primarily TIPS and, you know, IBONs,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.240]   basically insured by the federal government, backed by the federal government.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.600]   And so I don't take a lot of risk.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.520]   I don't own corporates.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.600]   I don't own junk bonds.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.160]   You know, if I'm going to take risk, I take real risk, you know.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.880]   I take it in my real estate holdings.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.080]   I take it into my stock holdings, but I don't do it on the bond side.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.200]   So the only risky thing I've got over there in the nominal side is some muni bonds.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.840]   I'm forced at this point to hold some of my bonds in a taxable account.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.640]   And so I have a Vanguard Municipal Bond Index Fund there.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.920]   I don't know if it's an index fund.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.160]   It's a bond fund from Vanguard, which is very index-like.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.440]   And it hasn't had a great year this year, like every other bond fund.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.040]   But it certainly isn't a risky bond fund.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.480]   It's just getting clobbered, so.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:50.860]   >> Yeah, I mean, half of investing is math, and the other half is Shakespeare.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:57.680]   And you gear the fixed income part of your portfolio to deal with the Shakespeare,
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.780]   being able to sleep in the worst states of the world.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.920]   Probably 90%, excuse me, 90% of your returns
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.500]   derive from how you behave in the worst 2% of the time, all right?
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.500]   And it may be the T-bills that you have that used to yield close to zero,
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.140]   were the best performing, highest performing assets in your portfolio.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.540]   Because they enable you to stay the course with the rest of it.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.940]   Jason, you can correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:30.540]   But I think at any one moment, about 20% of Berkshire is in T-bills.
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.220]   There's a reason why Warren Buffett likes T-bills.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:39.380]   >> Yeah, I mean, I would just add one very quick note,
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:47.100]   which is to a group like the Bogleheads, I mean, Treasury Direct is like candy.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.020]   I mean, a lot of people find the government website kind of
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.140]   old-fashioned and annoying and hard to use.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.500]   I think for Bogleheads, that probably isn't an issue.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:06.420]   And building a ladder of either nominal or
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:13.740]   real treasuries in the form of tips is really easy on Treasury Direct.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:20.460]   And I mean, you're getting like a 4% yield on short-term treasuries,
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.660]   probably more today, and that's nominal.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:29.380]   And you're getting a real return on tips of, as we've talked about,
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:35.460]   like in the 2% range, that's, I mean, to me, that's like a free lunch.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.780]   >> So let's talk a little bit more about tips.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:45.180]   This morning's CPI report, inflation in September was running 8.2%,
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.380]   prices 8.2% higher than a year ago.
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.620]   Core inflation, the highest since 1982.
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.420]   Inflation index bonds sound great.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.180]   And yet, when people have looked at their portfolios, and
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.140]   you see the Vanguard Tips Fund so far this year is down 13%,
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:10.580]   not much less than total bond down 15%.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:15.580]   So, Jim, do you want to talk to us about why?
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.140]   Let's just start with understanding what has happened this year with the tips.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.820]   >> This is one of my biggest frustrations of the year.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.460]   And I was discussing this with Bill at dinner last night.
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.140]   I hold these tips for years and years and years and
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.820]   years for this moment of unexpected high inflation.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.620]   And I just know that's going to be their day in their sun and
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.660]   they're going to do awesome.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.780]   And while everything else is plummeting, at least I'm going to have those tips.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.740]   And then this year, you look at intermediate treasuries and
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.660]   they're down 11%, 12%, and you look at the Vanguard Tips Fund,
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.420]   which has a slightly longer duration.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.380]   So it's a little bit riskier in that respect, down 13%.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.420]   It's kind of disappointing to me.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:03.220]   And that even with that inflation factor into it, they're still bonds,
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.540]   they still act like bonds.
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.660]   When rates go up, their value goes down.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.860]   And rates have gone up a lot this year, both nominal rates and real rates.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.580]   And it turns out that I think that factor
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.500]   is a bigger factor than the inflation adjustment is.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.980]   And I'm going to let Bill give you the answer he gave me last night when we were
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:24.940]   having this discussion.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.060]   >> Yeah, looked at from 50,000 feet, it's pretty simple,
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:35.340]   which is that nominal short treasuries are riskless in the short term.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.940]   But they're very risky in the long term, because you've got to reinvest them and
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.820]   you never know what you're going to reinvest at.
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.900]   And you could wind up reinvesting at a terrible rate,
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.380]   which is what's happened over the past ten years.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:51.700]   On the other hand, tips are riskless as long as you hold them to maturity, okay?
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.260]   So I just bought some 20-year tips the other week, and
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.060]   they're going to be absolutely riskless the year I turn 94, all right?
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.140]   >> [LAUGH] >> And which is important to me,
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.500]   because I don't want to be eating cat food when I'm 94.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.700]   But tomorrow, they may not be riskless.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:15.300]   And simply because you believe a certain precept in finance
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:21.860]   doesn't relieve you of the duty, the absolute duty of estimating expected returns.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.900]   And so if you were buying tips a year and a half ago,
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:32.820]   you were buying them at the short end, in five years, at a negative 1.5% return.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:39.020]   Which means that basically to get, if you put a dollar into the now,
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.460]   in five years, you're going to be getting $0.92 worth of consumption value.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.620]   Maybe you could justify that on theoretical grounds, but I couldn't.
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:53.620]   And so good things come to those who wait.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.180]   And that's particularly true of stocks, and it's also true of tips.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.980]   >> Two comments, just for clarification.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.300]   What Bill said is correct.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:08.860]   If you buy new issue tips, then you'll get the positive rate of return.
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.260]   You'll get your money back, because the government guarantees if you put $100,000
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.380]   into a new issue tip, that at maturity, you get $100,000 back.
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:22.180]   If you bought a 20-year tip
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.620]   that has, and you, let me get this right.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:32.300]   So if you bought a tip that was issued ten years ago, okay, at a certain level,
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.020]   you could lose money on that tip if you didn't buy it at the new issue price.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.860]   So new issue tips are guaranteed to get the money back.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.140]   But buying a used tip, if you will, something that's been out there for
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.380]   a while, secondary market tip, that may not be the case.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:54.820]   If it was issued at a price that was lower than what you bought at that,
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.340]   that's the base price.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.500]   So if the new issue tip was issued at a price that was lower than what you bought
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.980]   it at, it could actually lose value between now and the time that it matured.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.060]   >> There's one exception to that, and now we're really getting to the weeds.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.140]   There's one exception to that, and
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:14.340]   that is there is a tips that matures in February or January, I forget, of 2043.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.060]   Which is the one I'm talking about.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.900]   Which, if you multiply the inflation factor times its market price,
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.780]   it's still less than par, and it's got a one-eighth of a point coupon.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.020]   So you're basically buying a zero, so there's one exception to that rule.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.580]   >> [LAUGH] >> One more thing,
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.580]   I just wanted to clarify, what Jim was saying.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:41.420]   So the correlation between inflation and
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:47.780]   a tips index fund isn't very high, and which we've seen, negative 13%, right?
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.700]   But the correlation between short-term tips and inflation is much higher.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.220]   So if you're buying tips for the inflation hedge,
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.420]   you would really wanna focus on short-term, like the Vanguard short-term tips fund.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:06.740]   >> And I guess a related question that we often come up against in bond investing
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.180]   is buying individual bonds versus buying funds.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.380]   So if I want tips exposure as an inflation hedge,
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.060]   do I have to buy the individual bonds, or do I buy the fund and
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.180]   I just avert my eyes when the price fluctuates?
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:27.180]   >> Personally, I think that it's either, if you wanted to do a bond ladder,
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.860]   that works fine.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.260]   If you wanted to just do a fund, the duration is going to be the same.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.820]   So I don't see much difference, and I used to manage a lot of money in bonds, and
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.940]   I really don't see much difference.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.020]   >> Okay, so it's just a psychological one.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.980]   I have to just not look.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.940]   Right. >> Yeah, I own both.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.420]   So in my 401(k)s, I use a tips fund.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.580]   And now that I'm having to buy some in my taxable account,
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.100]   I'm just buying them at Treasury Direct.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.100]   I'm buying the individual issues.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.220]   And they both have pluses and minuses.
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.460]   And if those pluses and
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.300]   minuses matter a lot to you, then choose one over the other.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.660]   But for most of us,
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.980]   it's probably not a big question when it comes to your portfolio construction.
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:14.740]   >> I guess I would just add one distinction, which is if your choice,
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:22.780]   for whatever reason, is between buying one single issue of tips and buying a fund,
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.820]   I would definitely buy the fund.
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.060]   But if you can build a ladder or
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.420]   a diversified portfolio of individual tips,
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.260]   then I don't really think there's much difference.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.500]   >> Thank you.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.740]   Let's talk about real estate.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.980]   So REIT funds are among the many asset classes that are off sharply this year.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.100]   The Vanguard REIT fund is down about 32%.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.180]   One question we had from the audience is,
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.220]   are REITs still considered a separate asset class?
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.300]   Are they worthwhile to have in a portfolio?
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.860]   You can take those as two separate but related questions.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.620]   >> Go ahead, you're the REIT guy.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.180]   >> I'm the real estate guy now, huh?
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.460]   >> [LAUGH] >> I treat them as a separate asset class.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.900]   My portfolio is 60% stocks, 20% real estate, and 20% bonds.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.460]   Of that real estate allocation, 5% is simply in the Vanguard,
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.860]   publicly traded REIT index fund.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.220]   I own all the publicly traded REITs there.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.940]   I technically own them also in my total stock market fund.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.740]   They're all there, so I'm overweighting it.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.700]   And the reason I overweight it is because there's an awful lot of real estate in
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.100]   this country and in this world that is not publicly traded.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.180]   Much more so than other businesses.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:41.820]   And so I think you can justify overweighting real estate from that argument.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:47.060]   I also have about 15% of my portfolio that is not in publicly traded real estate.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.220]   It's in private real estate.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.580]   And the reason there is because I find some aspects of those investments
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.860]   to be attractive.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.700]   I see an illiquidity premium there.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.100]   I see some high expected returns.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.500]   And I find that I have enough money that I can actually diversify in that space,
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.820]   which is a tough thing for a lot of investors to do.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.380]   But I'm a big fan of real estate.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.860]   I do think it is a separate asset class.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:18.180]   The real downside of publicly traded REITs is that their correlation with
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.260]   the overall stock market is moderate to high.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.380]   And that's disappointing when you're looking for something that has high
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.860]   returns, but low correlation with your stocks.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.420]   Publicly traded REITs do that somewhat, but not awesome.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.860]   >> Okay, there is periods of time when REITs have been negatively
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.260]   correlated with the rest of the market.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:46.180]   So I know we haven't had one of those times, but there are times when it occurred.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.660]   It's a very variable thing.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.140]   And lately, yes, it has had high correlation.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.340]   I think you have to look at REITs.
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.300]   And by the way, the return of REITs versus the private market has actually been
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.020]   a little bit better.
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:03.100]   I did a podcast with Antti Ilmenen from AQR recently,
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.740]   maybe some of you caught that podcast.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.220]   We were talking about real estate.
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.500]   And we were talking about private real estate versus REITs.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.660]   And it turns out that, in his research, REITs have done better.
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.940]   Now, REITs are a little leveraged, perhaps, and
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:19.620]   that's what he believed was the reason.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.860]   And I thought his view on REITs were good, though.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:28.620]   He was basically saying that the dividend yield that the REITs are providing.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:33.980]   So if you have a REIT index fund, which right now is probably close to a 3%
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:39.380]   dividend yield, is probably the real return over inflation
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.700]   that you're gonna get from that investment.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.500]   Because the real estate portion of that
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.220]   is going to eventually increase with the inflation rate.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:55.060]   So if inflation goes up by 3%, the price of the REITs eventually will reflect that,
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.260]   and they'll go up by 3%, and the dividend yield on top of that that you're getting,
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.540]   the other 3%, is what your real return is.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.940]   And I think that's probably pretty accurate.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.300]   He also said that real estate was probably expected to return a little bit
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.020]   less than equity, so somewhere between equities and fixed income.
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.260]   And I do think that having real estate in your portfolio
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.260]   as a separate asset class makes sense.
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.220]   Because as Jim said, there's so much of it out there, and so
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:25.660]   much of the real estate is privately owned, that if you want your portfolio to
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:30.780]   more reflect what the economy is, or what GDP is, rather than what
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.940]   the stock market is, then you would own a little more real estate.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:38.220]   >> Wanted to hit on another question about dividends.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.180]   This was a question from the audience.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.820]   It's a more philosophical question.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.900]   Do dividends matter?
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.940]   That is, on a fundamental level, why should a corporation pay a dividend and
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.740]   create unwanted income for taxable investors?
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.060]   >> Boy, isn't that a good question?
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:59.220]   There's something called the Miller-Mavigliani theory that says it
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:06.460]   doesn't matter whether a company gives the dividend out to you or reinvests it.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.620]   There's a school of thought that says that
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.340]   companies shouldn't pay dividends at all.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.860]   They should just be buying back their own stock,
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.060]   which is actually more tax efficient.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:21.380]   But the history of finance suggests that companies do not
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.780]   make good use of eternally generated capital, all right?
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.380]   Think Snapple, okay?
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.420]   Think Time Warner AOL.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.820]   And in general, my philosophy is that it's better that companies
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.580]   give you those dividends.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:43.060]   Now it also, companies that, a high dividend rate is also a marker for
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:47.620]   a value company as well, for the value factor,
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.220]   which also suggests a slightly higher return as well.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.420]   So I'm a big fan of dividends, because you can use that capital
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.100]   a lot better than some megalomaniacal CEO can.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:03.700]   >> [LAUGH] >> I would just add one note.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.820]   Many years ago, back in the 80s, I think it was,
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:13.660]   Hugh Leetke, who then was the CEO of Pennzoil,
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:20.500]   said that he had come to believe in what he called the bladder theory of dividends.
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.980]   Which was, it was good for companies to pay them so
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.540]   they wouldn't piss their money away.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.500]   >> [LAUGH] >> So
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.260]   I just wanna make a comment on dividends.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.020]   It has to do with taxes, taxes, okay?
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.060]   So if your dividend-paying stock is in your taxable account,
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.060]   then you have to pay taxes on that.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.780]   If it's a US total market fund, usually it's long-term capital gain, about 90%.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.380]   If it's an international fund, only 70% would be long-term capital gain,
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.260]   and the other would be ordinary income.
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:55.300]   So if you're looking for dividends in your taxable account to live off of,
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.140]   you could say, well, I could have some internationally, I could have some US.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.460]   Or I could do something Alan Roth, who's sitting over here, suggested one time,
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:08.660]   is that buy a US total market fund in your taxable account, which pays low dividend.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.140]   And if you need to sell some stock, at least when you sell it,
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.380]   it'll be at a long-term capital gain, so you're gonna pay that rate.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.300]   But if you don't need to sell it because you don't need the money,
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.260]   then just leave it in there.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:23.100]   So from a tax standpoint, you really gotta think about
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.540]   dividends in your taxable accounts, just wanted to bring that up.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.020]   >> Let's talk a little bit more about taxes.
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:34.420]   So obviously, with the market down a lot, there are people who will have
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.420]   losses from when they purchase some of their investments,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.900]   that they can do tax loss harvesting.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:46.980]   I'd be interested in your thoughts on how helpful tax loss harvesting is,
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.940]   in any particular strategies or
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.860]   ways you think people should be thinking about that this year.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.580]   >> So my view on a taxable portfolio, again, because we're talking tax loss
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.300]   harvesting, is you want forever funds in your taxable account,
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.100]   total stock market, total international, things you're gonna hold forever.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.700]   That's what you want in your taxable account.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.620]   But if you have the opportunity to do a tax loss harvest using tax lots,
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.420]   because you bought in over time, because you have different tax lots,
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.420]   some that might be down, you wanna go ahead and
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.100]   sell the Vanguard total stock market, and you buy the iShare total stock market.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.860]   You wanna sell the Vanguard total international,
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.180]   you wanna buy the iShare total international, ETF.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.980]   You wanna take the tax loss, then you can take that tax loss,
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.140]   you can write off $3,000 worth of ordinary income, and you can use it to write off
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.340]   long term capital gains that you may have later on down the road as well.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.700]   And if you die, your kids get a stepped up basis, or
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.580]   your ears get a stepped up basis, so they never have to make it up.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.020]   So there's no recapture of that.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.620]   >> Can you really get away with that?
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:49.820]   I mean, aren't the iShares and say the Vanguard Fund substantially similar?
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.540]   I worry about that, it's a practical issue.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.620]   It may not be important, so you don't worry about it, all right.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.020]   >> I don't worry about it.
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:03.900]   If it's got a different Q-SIP number, does anybody know anybody who's ever been
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.580]   audited over their tax loss harvesting?
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:10.380]   I've asked this question to a lot of audiences, and
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.980]   nobody's ever raised their hand.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.460]   I'm not worried about that swap at all.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.180]   And those are the two partners I use.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.900]   So when I was getting my master's, I did a paper on tax loss harvesting.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.500]   What does this substantially identical mean?
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:29.060]   And you have to go back years to find cases of tax law that says,
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.420]   there was this case that was brought up in front of a tax court where they sold
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.300]   a five-year treasury bond, and they bought another five-year treasury bond.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.180]   But the coupon was a half a percent different.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.540]   Sell one five-year treasury, buy another five-year treasury,
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.220]   half a percent difference in the coupon rate.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.980]   The judge threw out the case, not substantially identical.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.220]   The coupons were different.
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.780]   So certainly, if you have a fund that's issued by Vanguard, and you sell it, and
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:55.540]   you buy a fund issued by iShares, it can't be substantially identical.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.140]   >> Totally agree with that.
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:04.060]   >> [LAUGH] >> The value of tax loss is beyond
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.820]   the $3,000 a year, really depends on how you're going to use them.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.940]   If those are shares you're gonna sell later anyway,
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.700]   you're just deferring taxes on them.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.780]   Maybe you can defer them to a time when you're in a lower capital gains bracket,
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.700]   and you get a little bit of an arbitrage there.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.260]   But it really depends on how you're going to use those, and
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.100]   whether you're gonna have a use for them.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.780]   And possible uses down the road for collecting hundreds of thousands of
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:32.340]   dollars of tax losses might be if you're gonna sell a really valuable house,
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.060]   for instance.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:37.180]   Remember, only your first $250,000 or first $500,000,
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.180]   if you're married, of your house gains are tax-free.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.900]   After that, it's a capital gain.
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.620]   If you're gonna sell a small business, for example,
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:51.540]   that would be something you could use all of those tax losses for.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:57.220]   So even though I've got enough tax losses to subtract $3,000 a year from my taxes
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:02.460]   every year from now until the time I'm 150, I'm still grabbing those
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:07.620]   tax losses for other purposes, for other capital gains I could have down the road.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.300]   So I think it's an exercise worth doing.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.460]   It's not very hard to do.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.580]   I'm not in there every day trying to do it.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.460]   I'm not hiring an advisor to do it.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.460]   If you just check every couple of months in a bear market, that's enough tax loss
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:25.980]   harvesting for most of us to have enough losses to do at least the $3,000 a year
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.980]   for the rest of our lives.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.140]   >> Let's talk a little bit about rebalancing.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:35.380]   Just going across the panel, I'd be interested in how often you rebalance
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.660]   your portfolio, how often you think people should look at their portfolio and
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.260]   rebalance.
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:48.060]   >> Well, I guess one quick note I would mention is that Jack Bogle didn't really
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:54.260]   believe in rebalancing, but everybody else does.
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:58.780]   [ Laughter ]
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.140]   You know, I'm quirky.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.340]   Like I have an HSA.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.540]   Christine will be happy to know I shovel as much money into that thing as I can.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:14.900]   And I rebalance that every paycheck.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:21.380]   I don't know why, but it makes me feel good somehow.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:30.860]   And elsewhere in my portfolio, I rebalance very, very seldom.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:39.460]   And typically what I do is I rebalance by harvesting some losses, and that's the
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.780]   way I do it.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.940]   >> I think the data is pretty clear that the ideal interval to rebalance is greater
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.420]   than a year.
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:52.460]   It's between one and three years I think is what most of the data has shown on that.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.460]   What do I do?
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.180]   Well, I'm still enough of an accumulator that I'm pouring enough money into the
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.900]   portfolio every year that I can just rebalance with new contributions.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.700]   So I invest once a month.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.660]   I take all the income from all sources that I have in the previous month, add it up,
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.940]   determine how much of it is going to be invested, and then I tend to look at my
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.660]   investments and go, "Well, what's behind?
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.340]   Let's throw all the money in there."
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:18.500]   But I can tell you over the last 16 years or so that I've been investing, 18 years,
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:23.940]   I've come to worry much less about having my portfolio exactly in balance.
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.580]   Close enough is good enough.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.660]   This is horseshoes and hand grenades terrain.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:33.340]   Yes, if you've gone from an 80% portfolio to a 50% portfolio, you need to rebalance.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:38.180]   But if we're talking about 80% and 77%, those portfolios perform almost identically
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.180]   anyway.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:45.700]   I certainly wouldn't accumulate any tax cost or transaction cost to do a rebalancing like
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.700]   that.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.700]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:55.620]   I mean, the pluses and minuses of rebalancing aren't all that big.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.780]   One thing we haven't talked about is are you in a taxable or a sheltered environment?
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.380]   If you're in a taxable environment, the cost of rebalancing is substantial.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.900]   Whereas, if you're in a tax-free or sheltered environment, it's not.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:12.060]   I think that you rebalance for two other reasons that have nothing to do with return.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.020]   Number one, you're doing it to limit risk, all right?
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:20.300]   You don't want to wake up one morning with an 85-15 portfolio and then be devastated
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:27.240]   when you get hit with a huge stock market fall if that prevents you from sleeping.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.540]   If it doesn't prevent you from sleeping, then God bless.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.460]   But the other reason why you rebalance is for emotional conditioning.
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:40.340]   It customs you to buying low and selling high.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:44.020]   And both of those are not easy emotional things to do.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:51.500]   And it sort of keeps you in financial shape, which is the reason why I do it, is just to
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.180]   keep my contrarian muscles moving.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:00.460]   A lot of times, if you're going to run into taxes because all your equity is in your taxable
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:07.580]   account and I believe your Roth accounts and your HSA should all have equity in it,
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.100]   because why not take advantage of that tax-free status of those accounts?
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:18.260]   So that means that you need to have equity in your tax-deferred accounts to do rebalancing
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.980]   and not pay taxes.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.980]   And if that's the case, fine.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:26.780]   You know, go to your 401(k), 403(b), IRA, and if you can do some rebalancing there,
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:27.780]   that's fine.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.700]   But eventually what might happen is you might end up with all fixed income in your tax-deferred
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:36.980]   account, all equity in your tax-free accounts, and then your taxable accounts are the only
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.660]   ones you could really rebalance.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:42.860]   And you really can't do much there, except if you're doing tax-less harvesting or you're
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:47.660]   adding more money, then you would just use the cash to do it as best you can.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.660]   Okay.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.660]   Let's take a break.
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.660]   I want one more thing.
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.740]   I want to thank the three of you for making me feel like a sick old geezer for still having
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:59.060]   money left in their HSA.
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.700]   And on that note, I think we'll see if there are people in the audience who have questions.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:07.300]   Do you want to take one of our mics?
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:14.420]   And then I'll hand you this one.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:20.080]   Okay.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.260]   Just one clarification.
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:29.900]   I'm investing, as I posted in the forum, for my mom who's near end of life, tax-less harvesting.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:34.720]   When a person passes and you have existing losses, that loss gets washed out.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.540]   So the capital, I forget which way it goes, but be careful if you're in that situation
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:53.700]   because those capital losses get washed out when they get passed on.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.700]   Good morning.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:39:02.140]   My question is around ESG investing and trying to make sense of that, get some returns.
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:07.220]   I've heard different opinions that it's not needed, it's not efficient, but at the same
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:11.740]   time I know I like to sleep at night knowing that my money is not coming from tobacco companies
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:12.860]   and the like.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:16.180]   So I would like to hear your thoughts on the matter.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:20.740]   I have strong feelings about ESG investing, but I'm going to let somebody else go first.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.540]   Oh boy.
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.540]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.540]   Okay.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.460]   If you think about it from the point of view of equilibrium finance, just because you've
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.920]   sold the stock doesn't mean that someone else isn't going to open it, own it.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.660]   So if half the people in the world don't want to own tobacco stocks, the other half of those
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:39.580]   people who do own the stocks, who the stocks get sold to, are going to be getting it at
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.800]   a bargain price and are going to be having a higher return.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.020]   Those stocks will still be owned even if you don't, all right?
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:52.260]   And so a better way to do it is to own the market, own the sinful stocks, then calculate
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:57.220]   how much excess returns you've made from the sinful stocks and put that money into advocacy.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.220]   That's the way to do it.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:06.900]   That's another reason why ESG is kind of a scam, which is that, don't get me started,
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:13.820]   all right, which is that if a company gets cheap enough, it gets taken private, okay?
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:19.580]   So would you rather be dealing with green energy policy with ExxonMobil or with Koch
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.580]   Industries?
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.580]   All right?
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.020]   So that's the second big reason to do it.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.340]   And then third reason is just from the investment point of view, the investment industry point
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.100]   of view, it's an enormous scam.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.260]   There are all these different scales for using them.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.940]   It's used as a marketing tool.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:37.740]   It's a Wall Street, it's a Wall Street hop, skip, and jump.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:44.660]   So if you think about, so Larry Suedro wrote a book about this, and I also interviewed
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:49.180]   a couple of other people on a podcast, and I thought about this as well.
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:54.600]   If you do not own the stock, you have no say in what the company does.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:59.640]   So by doing ESG and saying, "I don't want to own ExxonMobil," you have no say and no
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:04.220]   vote in what happens.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.300]   I think there are just far better ways to change the world.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:13.540]   If you really care to try to stop a company that you think is bad, lead a boycott of their
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.100]   products, right?
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:23.540]   Strike in front of Exxon gas stations, or start a letter writing campaign, or pressure
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:29.140]   their sponsors, or there's just all kinds of things that are more effective than picking
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:33.260]   an ESG fund and patting yourself on the back and feeling good about what you're doing for
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.260]   the world.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.940]   I just don't think it's very effective in actually changing the world.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.580]   Yeah, and paying actively managed fees for it.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:47.340]   It's just, you're far better off, just invest in all of them and donate to the charities
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:48.540]   that are going to change the world.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.300]   I think you're much better off doing that.
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:58.220]   Yeah, I mean, I would just add a quick thought, I think ESG has become popular for two reasons.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:06.460]   One, actively managed firms on Wall Street view it as their salvation, because from a
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:13.460]   marketing point of view, their message is indexing doesn't really work with ESG.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:20.120]   You need an active manager to probe these companies to see whether they really are E
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:30.460]   and S and G. And of course, that's B, S. But it's good marketing, and it's very effective
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.860]   at the institutional level.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:37.980]   Pension funds are very lightly indexed in ESG.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:42.860]   They've decided, they and their consultants have decided that you need active management
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.860]   if you do ESG.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.300]   So, I mean, that's the first thing you should realize.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:51.260]   I mean, if you're a boglehead, because you're skeptical about active management, you should
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:55.860]   be really skeptical about active ESG management.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:05.620]   The second thing, which to me is more personal, is I worry that ESG investing is a way of
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:13.540]   shifting the responsibility for making the world a better place from each of us to somebody
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:14.540]   else.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:21.540]   I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've been in a grocery store parking lot and seen
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:28.940]   somebody get out of their Land Rover SUV, no offense to the Land Rover owners in the
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:33.980]   room, they get out of their Land Rover SUV and they leave the motor running while they
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:41.140]   go into the grocery store, and like a half hour later, they come out with their grocery
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.140]   cart.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:50.260]   I mean, if that's you and you want to buy an ESG fund, then I have a big problem with
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.260]   that, and it's not the fund.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:59.380]   Okay, my question is around market timing.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.620]   So we're all bogleheads, and we're not supposed to market time.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:06.620]   But I think generally we all love tips right now, it seems like.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.820]   So is that market timing?
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.100]   And if it is, what could go wrong?
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.460]   What are we not seeing about tips that we should be worried about?
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.940]   I mean, I've owned tips for 16 years as 10% of my portfolio.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.860]   I owned 10% last year, I own 10% this year, I'll own 10% next year.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:29.940]   So this year has not been good to me in that particular asset class, but I don't see any
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:30.980]   market timing there.
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:37.880]   I don't change my portfolio based on the fact that tips yield 1.7% this year.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:42.540]   But it sounds like Bill might, so let's give this question to him.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.780]   Yeah, I mean, I'll repeat what I said before, which is just because you believe in the efficient
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:51.980]   market hypothesis doesn't mean you shouldn't be looking at expected returns, all right?
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:58.380]   And if an asset class has gotten particularly cheap, well, okay, I'm guilty, I'm a market
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.900]   timer.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.340]   I knew you were.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:07.140]   Those short-term bonds for the last 15 years, I knew it.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:14.500]   Okay, tips are the only investment grade bond that is not included in the total bond market
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:15.500]   fund.
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:20.540]   Okay, so if you wanted to have a total, total bond market US fund, then you would have to
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:26.220]   include, say, 10% of your portfolio in tips anyway, just to have the market.
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:33.300]   Of course, you're leaving out the international bonds, if that's all you're doing.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:36.020]   Well, I'm just saying.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.020]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:46.860]   Hi, my question has to do with buying on the dip and rebalancing.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:52.860]   Is there anything wrong with rebalancing now while your equities are down twice as much
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:59.340]   as your bonds and putting your bonds more in the equities to buy on the dip to rebalance?
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.660]   I'm not sure which dip you're talking about.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.380]   Are you talking about the dip in bonds or the dip in stocks?
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.780]   They're actually both.
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:10.100]   They're actually both, but the equities are down twice as much as the bonds.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.480]   Double dip.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.140]   There's nothing wrong with doing that.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:17.700]   No, you're rebalancing.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:22.420]   I mean, there's a lot of market timing going on in every little daily decision we make,
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:23.420]   right?
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.540]   Are you going to invest your monthly WAD that you have to invest today, or are you going
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.700]   to do it tomorrow?
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:35.420]   Every month, you got this question, and am I going to rebalance this month, or am I going
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.020]   to rebalance next month?
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:41.420]   You'll drive yourself crazy if you're thinking about this every time you have to make a little
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.020]   investing decision, so try to automate as much as possible.
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:51.380]   Try to just do it blindly as much as possible, and I think that's better behaviorally.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.500]   Even if there are times when it is not as good mathematically, I think your behavior
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:00.420]   in the long run trumps the math in that respect.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.860]   Hi.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:10.380]   I'm in my mid-60s, and I'm-- No, you're not.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:15.700]   Get out of here.
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:24.420]   I receive a pension from my career that I left some years ago.
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:28.740]   I work now, still part-time when I want on my own terms.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.040]   I enjoy my work.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:36.740]   I've postponed taking Social Security for a few more years, like at 70.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.540]   I own my house outright.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:39.940]   Am I an accumulator?
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.140]   Am I a retiree?
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.340]   Am I an accumulator-iree?
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.420]   Am I a retiretor?
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:57.180]   I'm just trying to figure out which breakout session I should be going into.
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:04.180]   I think we'll take that as a great reminder that it's time to wrap up this session.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.980]   I think you raise a good point, though, that applies to everything we talk about in personal
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:14.660]   finance, that we are all multifaceted individuals.
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:19.300]   We can't put ourselves into a bucket and say, "Well, you're this or that."
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.020]   You have pieces of each of those.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:27.620]   I would encourage you to look at all the sessions and figure out the particular topics or speakers
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:32.460]   that most seem relevant to you, and don't worry which label.
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:38.860]   I like the idea of coming up with new labels, and certainly an issue for people as retirement
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:44.500]   becomes a very different thing than it was decades ago, and people are trying to redefine
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.900]   that next episode of their life.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:50.180]   Maybe you will come up with the right label for us.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.940]   I think on that note, we're going to wrap up this session.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.380]   Thank you to four amazing panelists.
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:03.860]   Thank you also to the audience.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:11.260]   Your questions in this session and the previous session were amazing, thoughtful, and really
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.900]   got our panelists to say some very interesting things.
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:15.900]   Thank you.
