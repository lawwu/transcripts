[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   What's up everybody this is Michael Porter Jr. I'm super excited for you guys to hear
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.960]   about my new project called Curious Mike. I've been working on it for a while. It's
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.120]   coming out soon. So I had my sister sit down with me and ask me questions about what's
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.760]   going on so you guys get a better picture. See you soon.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:26.320]   So we have been working on this little project for like almost six months now. And just share
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.120]   with everyone what the project actually is. What is Curious Mike? What's the premise
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.320]   behind the show? So Curious Mike the idea, well the name started
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.160]   from you. I remember we were in L.A. and you came up with the name. But way before that
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.000]   I had kind of been wanting to figure out some way to use my platform to influence people.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.960]   And I didn't want it to really be Instagram and I didn't really want it to be Twitter
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.280]   because you know you post a picture and then you can write a caption and that's about it.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.800]   And I've always been someone who has had a lot of questions, always felt like I thought
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.080]   differently than a lot of people and always just thought about the deeper things in life.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.880]   And that has gotten me into trouble at times because you know Twitter or Instagram like
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.920]   they'll take like short clips of what I would say and then the whole world would see it
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.440]   and then they get a picture of who you are as a person. And so honestly that took me
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.020]   away from social media for a while like I didn't want anything to do with social media.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.280]   And during that time away I wanted to figure out a way to still use my platform but not
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.200]   necessarily be on Instagram all day like everybody else. And so I came up with the idea for like
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.680]   a podcast or like a YouTube just talking about the real things in life. Things that people
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.440]   don't necessarily talk about. I tend to be very curious, just the deeper things in life.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.440]   So I decided a podcast or a YouTube channel would be the way to go. And then you know
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.160]   I brought it to you and then you thought Curious Mike would be a good name because that just
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.680]   kind of describes me ever since I was really little. So that's kind of how it started.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.480]   Yeah I feel like the name Curious Mike describes you because it's like a humble approach to
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.560]   just trying to figure out life. I feel like the way your mind works you're always asking
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.560]   questions. You're just seeking knowledge. You're seeking to understand things on like
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.200]   a deeper level. And it's almost like society doesn't have grace for people asking questions
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.160]   anymore. I feel like you're creating a space where you can ask questions and try to figure
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.760]   things out without like judgment. And yeah like you said that was the whole idea for
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.920]   me because in today's age if your thought patterns or what you say goes against the
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.400]   narrative they'll cancel you. Or you can't really have your own opinion or people are
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.200]   scared to speak their mind because of the backlash they might get. And like I said like
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.720]   I've always been someone that is comfortable speaking my mind. But I mean even for me with
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.240]   the backlash I would get with some of the things I would say and people not understanding
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.760]   you know the intent behind it or why I said it. It just it kind of bothered me because
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.400]   we should be able to live in a world where people can you know speak their mind ask questions
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.720]   and be curious. No one has it all figured out. And I just feel like the more we can
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.840]   openly talk about things and you know right or wrong then the better we'll be as a society.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.040]   Just being able to listen. I feel like that's a big thing on your show. You have guests
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.440]   on that have maybe some different perspectives than you. Some are the same. And you just
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.760]   want to listen and learn. And so what is something that you have learned through one of your
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.360]   guests that you're really excited for people to hear about? And who are your guests? You
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.080]   can go through who they are. Yeah so first four guests Lecrae. You're gonna be a great
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.900]   leader man. Like be careful bro because I can see. I just could feel like with the type
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.460]   of insight and curiosity you have like that's just Satan don't want you to win bro. He don't
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.960]   want you to win. I've always been a big fan of his and his music and just his perspective
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.200]   on life. You know being in the rap culture but trying to be different. And then you have
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:11.960]   my aunt Nancy who I think she's 86 or 87 now. I got tired. I'm not sure. She says it in
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.600]   the episode but I forget. But she's up there. But she's one of the most energetic joyful
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.840]   people that I know and so I wanted to get her on there and just you know talk about
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.600]   you know being living life so long. Living through so many different periods of time.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.560]   Just I feel like you can get a lot of wisdom from older people. And then you got Trey Young
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.680]   who's been one of my best friends ever since we started playing basketball together. So
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.400]   I know you kind of have a mindset of like you're not you're not worried about what other
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.920]   people say. Yeah. Yeah. But it took me a while to get to this point. Like I think it's tough
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.280]   because our generation is like is the first generation that's really going through this.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.040]   And you know we just talk about all kinds of things more basketball related and you
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.680]   know the pressures of being an NBA player and things like that. And then lastly you
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.440]   got Judah Smith who's a celebrity passed out in L.A. We can't even love ourselves without
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.000]   the help of Jesus. Bro I've had so many sleepless nights where I've wondered am I ever going
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.680]   to fix this temptation these challenges these weaknesses. He's around a lot of different
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.480]   celebrities but he also is one of the most humble down to earth people I know and I'm
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.560]   just you know asking all these guys different questions like my goal is to just have people
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.440]   on the show that I respect and that I you know I want to learn from them like I see
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.040]   how they view life and I just want to ask questions and get to know more about them.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.160]   And you know I feel like the people watching will be able to just see a side of me and
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.280]   just see a side of these other people that you know a lot of celebrities or famous people
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.180]   don't necessarily show even though like I said all the time we're all just people like
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.920]   no one's supposed to be more famous or anything than another person we're all just people
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.760]   that happen to be talented at different things so that's the goal.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.640]   Is there one conversation that you've had in those interviews that has you feel like
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.720]   has really stuck with you and that you're really hoping people learn from?
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.620]   They all have their bits and pieces like each one I feel like those dudes are really really
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.360]   smart and give really good answers to some of the tough questions. But I can't wait for
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.920]   people to see I don't want to spoil too much of what that what it what it is but all those
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.760]   dudes are great and then obviously and Nancy all of them are great interviews and it's
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.680]   going to be it's going to be amazing.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.040]   For sure well is there just looking down the road if we continue doing this is there one
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.560]   person out there that like this is just a fun question that you really want to have
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.140]   on the show that is kind of a reach?
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:45.860]   I really always have loved Jim Carrey and his acting you know he talks about that just
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.100]   how he wishes everyone would be famous so that they could be famous and realize that
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.140]   that's not where you find peace and happiness. I want to get him on the show because there's
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:00.940]   a movie called The Truman Show and in the movie you know he's he's like inside a TV
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.000]   show but he thinks it's real life and then he finally escapes and realizes what reality
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.420]   is and honestly like watching that show for the longest time like I thought that was me
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.540]   like I didn't know if there was anybody out there who really thought like me who process
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.820]   life like me and I kind of felt isolated because you can't talk to people about some some things
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:27.140]   you know some people just don't even think like that so it kind of it kind of just got
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.220]   me thinking and then you know Jim Carrey's just I watched some of his interviews you
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.220]   know he's he's made it in this world like he has everything anybody would want in this
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.140]   world but he just talks about the deeper things and what's really real so if there was one
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.460]   person I would say Jim Carrey.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.900]   That would be so sick well I think it's been so special for me to see you grow as this
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.500]   leader and like start to use your voice for something that really matters to you and just
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.740]   sharing more of yourself with the world because like you said snippets on Twitter Instagram
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.940]   don't paint the full picture of anybody and I just think that this is a really cool project
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.540]   where people are going to see into your mind they're going to see into the minds of some
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.260]   really really smart people too and yeah it's been really fun to be a part of it so I'm
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.260]   proud of you.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.620]   I can't wait to get it going you know first four episodes are coming out pretty soon and
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.340]   then you know after those release try to get four more people just keep it going this is
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.980]   something I'm really passionate about outside of basketball like I feel like my purpose
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:31.500]   is to be a leader you know help do what I can to use my influence in society and I feel
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.180]   like this is this is a big way to do it so outside of basketball like this is a passion
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:40.780]   of mine hopefully I get better as time goes on and asking good questions and everything
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:48.700]   but I'm excited because you know people have you know like I said before like certain things
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:54.340]   that I've said or whatever people get a certain picture of you and you know a lot of people
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.700]   there's been so many times I've gone viral for a different snippets you know some I'll
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.180]   tweet or something that I'll say on Snapchat and people don't really know the intent behind
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.900]   it but just to be able to dive into some of those topics why I thought this why I'm thinking
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.940]   this and then you know ask people what they think you know and just learn constantly learn
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.060]   I think it's going to be dope and that's that's the concept behind Curious Mike and I can't
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.060]   wait to get it going.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.780]   All right well that's a wrap.
