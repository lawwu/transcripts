[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]   All right, Jesse, sound like a plan?
[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.060]   - Yeah, sounds great.
[00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.420]   - All right, well, let's go on to our deep dive.
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.660]   I'm calling this one a world without Twitter.
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.260]   So I made what's perhaps the mistake
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.260]   of checking in this week on media coverage of Twitter,
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.380]   Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, what's going on there.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.040]   I regret it.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.540]   I kind of want those 30 minutes of my life back.
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.540]   Here's what I noticed in my cursory examination
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.820]   of media coverage of Elon Musk and Twitter
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.260]   is that essentially a decision has been made
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.060]   that Elon Musk is public enemy number one,
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.660]   and it has led to news coverage
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.020]   that I find to be both boring and ironic.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.160]   So I think it's boring because what we have
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.540]   is just everyone lining up to take their shot
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.100]   at attacking Musk and why he's bad, right?
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.300]   So there's a pinata hanging, a proverbial pinata hanging,
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.580]   and there's a full consensus that this is a bad pinata
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.140]   that is going to destroy democracy.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.940]   So I don't know where you buy your pinatas from,
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.060]   but don't buy it from that store.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.180]   And everyone's just lining up to take their take.
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.740]   Now, why this is ironic is because it feels
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.380]   as if this consensus of he is bad guy number one
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.160]   needs to go away was formed on Twitter,
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.260]   is being enforced on Twitter,
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.040]   and after everyone takes their turn
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.100]   with their takedown piece on Musk,
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.980]   they then return to Twitter to see
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.660]   if they're getting enough lottets
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.980]   or how much celebration they're getting.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.420]   So it's this weird sort of incestual circularity going on
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.060]   where all these reporters are obsessed with Twitter,
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.080]   that obsession with Twitter is fueling their takedown
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.820]   of Twitter on which they're seeing what the reaction is
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.860]   to their takedown of Twitter, all of it's all mixed up,
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.280]   and it's just uninteresting to me.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.960]   So I thought, let me come at this topic
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.220]   from a different angle.
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.500]   So one of the discussions that's happening,
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.700]   which I think is more interesting,
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.240]   is will we see a viable alternative to Twitter emerge?
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.060]   And in particular, there's a strain of conversation
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.300]   that's big right now that's saying,
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.300]   will the potential fall of Twitter lead to the rise
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.920]   of one of the independent social media alternatives?
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.060]   So these independent social media alternatives
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.780]   that are not massive platform monopolies
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.320]   owned by billionaires.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.620]   Now, I don't wanna act as if I'm ahead of all trends,
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.800]   but I do wanna point towards an article I wrote
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.420]   for "The New Yorker" back in 2019.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.580]   I'm loading this on the tablet now
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.060]   for people who are watching
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.880]   at youtube.com/calendareportmedia.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.180]   This was actually my first article I ever wrote
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.780]   for "The New Yorker."
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.700]   It is from May of 2019, and the title is,
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.700]   "Can Indie Social Media Save Us?"
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.580]   So the point of this article was to look at this subset
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.940]   of the social media universe which had been overlooked,
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.500]   which is independent social media services,
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.540]   small, often open-source social media alternatives.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.000]   At the time, there wasn't much discussion of these.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.040]   Today, there is.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.100]   And in particular, in the last new cycle or two,
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.020]   there's been a lot of focus
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.700]   on one particular independent social media service
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.100]   called Mastodon.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.400]   I'm gonna scroll here in this article
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.000]   to show you that Mastodon is something I mentioned about.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.960]   So here we go.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.060]   From my piece, "Mastodon,
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.660]   "another popular indie web service,
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.760]   "exists in the middle ground
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.740]   "between centralized and decentralized social media."
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.060]   So I talked about Mastodon back in 2019
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.540]   as a potential Twitter alternative.
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.440]   So this is what I wanna get into today.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.900]   How does Mastodon work?
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.520]   Will it emerge as a potential,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.140]   more independent alternative to what Twitter was doing?
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.380]   And if so, will that be better?
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.500]   And if not, what does that tell us?
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.700]   So how does Mastodon work?
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.380]   Will it become an alternative to Twitter?
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.340]   And then I'll return to what I wrote in this article,
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.340]   and we'll see how my conclusions from back then
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.860]   mesh with what I'm thinking today.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.580]   All right, so what is Mastodon?
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.740]   Well, the right way to understand it is
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.580]   it is an open-source Twitter-style service,
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.980]   but unlike Twitter, it is distributed.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.580]   So there is open-source software
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.760]   for running a Mastodon server.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.960]   Anyone can go and download the software.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.620]   They can install it on their own server,
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.180]   and they can run a Mastodon server.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.540]   It's open-source, so it's free.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.420]   You just have to give proper acknowledgement
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.580]   that, hey, this code comes from the Mastodon project.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.160]   A little aside, there's a whole controversy
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.940]   that only really tech nerds understood,
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.900]   but when Donald Trump first launched
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.520]   his social media network, Truth Social,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.860]   they essentially just stole all the code from Mastodon
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.940]   without doing any of the acknowledgments,
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.740]   and that created a bit of a problem.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.580]   That sounds familiar.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.700]   Anyways, so anyone can download the software,
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.540]   start their own server.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.740]   So Jesse and I could put a computer here in the studio,
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.580]   and we could run a Mastodon server on it.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.780]   When you're running a Mastodon server,
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.460]   you can have users join, sign up,
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.840]   have a username for your server,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.080]   and what the server implements is something like Twitter.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.260]   You can post things on the server, up to 500 characters,
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.120]   and you can see what other people have posted
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.120]   in reverse chronological order.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.040]   So very much like a Twitter short form post,
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.480]   reverse chron, sorting type system.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.920]   It has a similar follower dynamic to Twitter as well,
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.760]   so you can actually say,
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.820]   "Well, here are the people I wanna actually follow,
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.740]   "so show me their posts when they come up
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.200]   "in reverse chronological order.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.920]   "I don't wanna know about that person," et cetera.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.520]   All right, so that's the core of Mastodon.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.840]   I can start my own mini Twitter for free.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.400]   Anyone can join it.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.440]   Typically, the way these servers are supported
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.320]   is Patreon, that's pretty common.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.560]   I mean, it's not super expensive to run one of these servers
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.960]   but you might just ask the members,
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.880]   "Hey, can you kick in and donate?"
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.840]   So that's a nice benefit from those who are concerned
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.280]   about attention economy dynamics.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.620]   It's typically not ad-based.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.840]   It's, "Hey, this is gonna cost whatever,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.320]   "couple thousand dollars a year to run.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.640]   "Hey, users on my server, can you chip in some money?"
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.040]   Mastodon also comes with a protocol
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.120]   for different servers to talk to each other.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.280]   So now what can happen is,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.600]   let's say you have an account on the server
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.920]   that Jesse and I have here in the studio
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.560]   and there's whatever, 100 users who use this server
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.000]   and you follow some of them and you post
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.640]   and it looks like Twitter.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.560]   You can follow people on other servers as well.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.760]   So let's say someone else we know
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.520]   has their own Mastodon server
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.720]   and someone else who's interesting,
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   who you find to be more interesting than Jesse and I,
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.760]   is over on that other server.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.600]   So maybe you're like,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.960]   "You know, I kinda like the Cal and Jesse server.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.140]   "A lot of Harry Potter talk going on.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.960]   "Not so sure that I only wanna hear what they have to say."
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.920]   But someone else we like is on another Mastodon server.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.680]   You can say, "I wanna follow them."
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.000]   And this protocol, what it will do is basically
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.300]   your server will then talk to that other server and say,
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.460]   "Hey, we have someone over here
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.860]   "who cares about a user of yours.
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.440]   "Let us know when they post things."
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.640]   And so now I can see posts from other servers
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.920]   show up in my feed.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.120]   All right, so it's a distributed solution.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.120]   Individuals run these servers,
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.900]   but the servers can talk to each other.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.480]   So I can see what people post on other servers
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.720]   if I choose to follow them and send a request.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.820]   That's Mastodon.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.820]   It has a real community niche feel.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.760]   So traditionally, each individual Mastodon server,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.960]   which are called instances in Mastodon speak,
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.980]   will develop their own,
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.260]   often quite complex community standards.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.600]   That's the whole feel of Mastodons.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.640]   Like over here, we have very specific rules
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.920]   about what you can and can't talk about.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.240]   Over here, they might be different.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.840]   This is similar a little bit to what we see
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.280]   with Reddit and subreddits.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.260]   We get these very specific community standards
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.860]   that exist on different Reddits.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.800]   As it's become clear in the recent news cycles,
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.140]   it also has very powerful banning type features.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.080]   So you can easily, as an admin,
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.880]   kick people off your instance.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.840]   You can also block people on your server
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.880]   from following anyone from another server.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.280]   So I can, if I run the Jesse Cal server,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.460]   and I don't like this rival Harry Potter server,
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.800]   I can ban that server,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.360]   which means no one on my server
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.200]   is allowed to follow anyone from that server.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.720]   You can also ban individuals.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.180]   No one on my server can follow this particular individual.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.900]   So there's a lot of power the admins have
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.520]   to control not just what's posted,
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.100]   but who the people on their server can actually follow
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.360]   or receive information from.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.760]   All right, so that's basically how Mastodon works.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.820]   So it is Twitter, but it has its own thing going on.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.800]   Back to my 2019 article,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.400]   I'll just show a couple things I wrote
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.020]   about Mastodon back then.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.280]   So one thing I wrote in that article is,
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.600]   because most Mastodon instances are small,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.200]   each typically, typically each number
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.720]   is a couple thousands of users,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.880]   and crowdfunded by their members,
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.060]   they feel different from mass social media
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.320]   with an enticing freeform energy
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.340]   reminiscent of the internet's early days.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.040]   The contrast between this atmosphere
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.000]   and the one found on existing social networks
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.680]   is striking.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.960]   So you definitely get this feel.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.280]   I hung out a lot on Mastodon
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.920]   when I was writing that 2019 article.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.040]   It feels like early web stuff.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.280]   Very specific niche communities, very specific rules,
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.400]   reminiscent of the textual conventions
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.560]   of Usenet news groups,
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.360]   or the weird acronyms that were developed,
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.400]   the standards that were developed
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.380]   on early bulletin boards like The Well.
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.880]   Here's a more concrete summary I gave
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.400]   from that experience.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.760]   Mastodon, at least for now,
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.200]   is a human scale environment
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.720]   in which users are happy to chat
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.240]   about quirky things with other quirky people.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.520]   Recently, when I logged into the Mastodon instance,
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.160]   sunbeam.city, a quote,
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.560]   "Libertarian socialist solar punk instance,"
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.840]   I found a photo of someone's blooming spider plant
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.760]   next to a conversation about the consequences
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.960]   of ethical transparency and hierarchical systems.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.480]   It struck me as the quintessential
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.880]   early internet experience.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.800]   Right?
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.680]   So that's what Mastodon looked like to me in 2019.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.920]   It's like old Usenet boards.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.960]   It's cool.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.760]   Everyone's doing their own thing.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.160]   The following between servers didn't seem widespread.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.800]   It was more, "I like sunbeam.city.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.680]   I like these people.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.660]   We have our own quirky thing going on.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.600]   Let's just go hang out there."
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.140]   So a really good early web energy.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.680]   Can this be a replacement for Twitter
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.880]   that doesn't have one person?
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.620]   Priorly, that might've been Jack Dorsey.
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.600]   Today, it's Elon Musk.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.640]   Can we have a version of Twitter then
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.880]   where there is no one person,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.080]   some sort of a utopian alternative to Twitter?
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.840]   Can these good vibes I picked up in 2019 scale
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.880]   to be a Twitter-size impact on the internet?
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.480]   And here my argument is no.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.040]   Mastodon will never be Twitter.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.740]   It will never have its same significance
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.440]   or its same audience.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.380]   The reason for this,
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.360]   and as I've talked about before on this show,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.440]   Twitter is incredibly successful
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.280]   because it is a finely tuned engagement machine.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.280]   That is very difficult to do.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.560]   So we've gone into this before,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.520]   but at the core of Twitter's success is three elements.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.820]   One, that it has a massive user base
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.220]   that includes many potentially interesting people
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.400]   with engaging things to say.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.320]   So you need a huge foundation
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.800]   of potentially interesting people
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.480]   with potentially interesting things to say.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.560]   And I'm using interesting here
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.680]   in a completely value-neutral manner.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.840]   It could be, interesting means engaging.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.420]   So it could be outrageous.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.820]   It could be shocking, or it could be funny,
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.220]   or it could be very smart.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.760]   So you have comedians, you have expert commentators,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.820]   you have celebrity figures,
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.440]   you have figures who have interesting takes
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.720]   on different aspects of the culture.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.960]   It's huge user base.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.780]   Number two, Twitter has this massive social graph
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.320]   where all of these people have painstakingly defined
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.620]   these one-on-one dyadic follower connections.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.000]   This creates this densely connected social graph
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.720]   that is encoding these type
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.440]   of social cultural capital relations.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   I'm following you because of,
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.400]   I just, all these subtle things I know about you
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.640]   and your standing in society
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.780]   or the content that you produce.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.120]   You combine that with the retweet button
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.160]   and they come together to give you this sort of emergent,
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.800]   distributed curation algorithm
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.040]   that's fantastically effective.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.300]   So you have all these interesting people
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.240]   throwing out potentially effective things.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.720]   Then you have the cumulative impact of 237 million users
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.000]   clicking retweet in this complex social graph.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.800]   And what emerges is this really successful
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.300]   filtering function where stuff that's engaging
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.940]   is identified and spread.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:49.760]   As a result, if you click that Twitter app on your phone,
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   its ability to show you thing after thing after thing
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.540]   that's going to capture your attention,
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.600]   that you could lose hours into, is almost unparalleled.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.320]   Instagram can do this pretty well
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.720]   with a similar sort of setting.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.760]   Facebook is used to do this pretty well,
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.640]   but is now struggling.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.080]   TikTok is doing this very well,
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.440]   as we've talked about before.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.240]   They've replaced this human centric distributed curation
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.140]   with pure algorithmic curation,
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.400]   but it works pretty well in the sense of
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.840]   you can get lost in TikTok
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.360]   even more effectively than Twitter.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.600]   But very few people can do this.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.040]   It is a tight wire act.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.560]   It is very difficult to pull off.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.600]   This, I can get lost in hours streaming
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.080]   almost everything I see scrolling on this app
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.720]   is gonna catch my attention in some way.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.980]   Mastodon can't replicate that.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.960]   It doesn't have enough critical mass of interesting people.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.800]   It doesn't have this existing deep complex follower,
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.920]   social graph, which does a really good job
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.480]   of amplifying things.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.600]   In fact, the dynamics of the Mastodon,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.080]   there's a few choices that they've made specifically.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.600]   And by they, there's an actual founder, Eugene Rochko.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.720]   They've made these decisions
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.240]   to try to cut down on virality.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.400]   You can't quote tweet people,
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.480]   whatever they would call it on Mastodon,
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.320]   quote post people.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.960]   It's difficult to spread other people's things.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.480]   Eugene wanted it to be more people
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.040]   just talking back and forth.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.300]   It's difficult to do threads.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.520]   You have all this dynamic of very niche content moderation
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.740]   and banning back and forth between different people.
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.520]   So you don't have that virality.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.360]   You don't have the core of interesting people.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.880]   So what you don't get on Mastodon is that experience.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.880]   So if I open that app and I am engaged
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.480]   for as long as I wanna scroll,
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.000]   what I saw when I was on Mastodon,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.600]   which I think is true of the experience today,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.160]   is you enter a conversation with a community.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.500]   Most of the stuff you see is not that interesting.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.240]   It's more about going back and forth with people
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.620]   that over time you get to know.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.920]   And you find interesting things.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.200]   You have to do a lot of work.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.280]   You have to do a lot of sifting.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.840]   That's early web stuff.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.740]   And it's cool.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.240]   But from a pure engagement perspective,
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.120]   can't hold a candle to Twitter.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.560]   No one is gonna fall down a Mastodon rabbit hole
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.720]   hours at an end.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.200]   As reporter after reporter is realizing
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.360]   as they write about this service,
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.300]   it's actually kinda hard to spend a lot of time on Mastodon.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.680]   It's like a Usenet news group in the early days.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.720]   It's like the well.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.760]   There's some cool stuff.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.680]   You meet some cool people.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.720]   Most of it's not that engaging.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.160]   So no, I don't think Mastodon's gonna be
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.120]   a replacement for Twitter.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.280]   Is that a problem?
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.360]   I would say no.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.940]   I don't think we need a replacement for Twitter.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.880]   There is a great danger in taking essentially
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.320]   the entire populace of internet users
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.020]   and putting them all together on a homogenized interface.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.260]   Everyone has easy access, the exact same accounts,
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.280]   all information looks the same,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.640]   the network of connections through which information
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.780]   is being amplified, the curation is happening
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.540]   on the scale of hundreds of millions of users.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.940]   I think that is a dangerous recipe.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.700]   I think that is a dangerous recipe.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.500]   It does not play well with the human social brain.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.420]   It create, the virality dynamics create these,
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.280]   as we've seen, intense tribal pressures,
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.440]   intense psychological distress.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.540]   Yes, it's very engaging to look at Twitter,
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.060]   but Twitter over the last three or four years
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.580]   has become engaging in the same way
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.840]   that the Roman Colosseum was engaging.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.060]   It's more about watching gladiators from your tribe
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.340]   do battles from gladiators from the other tribe,
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.060]   reveling in the outrage when someone from your tribe
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.020]   is being unfairly speared with the proverbial trident
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.920]   and the people commenting on how unfair this is,
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.700]   celebrating when your team gets someone from the other team.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.340]   We found an angle of attack.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.900]   We threw that net thing around them
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.320]   and dragged them into the lion pit.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.960]   It's spectacle, it's a spectacle of the elites,
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.580]   as I said in a recent New Yorker piece.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.700]   Yeah, it's engaging,
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.580]   but we don't need that type of engagement.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.160]   And I know there's lots of other arguments
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.000]   in favor of Twitter.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.040]   Journalists like it because it helps them find
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.380]   what's going on in the news.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.820]   I don't mind if you have to work harder
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.020]   to find out what's going in the news
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.180]   because the side effect of you all using the same platform
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.640]   is that everything becomes consensus.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.480]   Everyone just says,
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.400]   what is our particular tribe in the world of media
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.480]   think about this?
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.160]   Great, let's go.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.280]   There's not enough interesting new angles.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.560]   There's not enough, I would say,
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.440]   diverse viewpoints of world events.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.900]   It all just breaks, balkanizes into three viewpoints
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.100]   and everyone goes back to the arena.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.620]   So I don't care if it's harder for you to find news.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.080]   Yeah, it can help you connect with interesting people.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.000]   There's other ways to connect with interesting people
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.420]   that aren't gonna put your blood pressure through the roof.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.840]   That's not gonna give you a low grade anxiety disorder
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.400]   like Twitter can do.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.660]   Mastodon is great for that.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.500]   Join an instance, have several instances.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.880]   If affinity groups are related to things you care about,
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.060]   you can build really interesting relationships there.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.020]   It's a small scale, it's a human style scale,
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.000]   but it's connecting you to people
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.240]   that you never otherwise would have found
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.200]   without the internet.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.220]   That's brilliant social internet possibility at work
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.900]   without those downsides of Twitter.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.200]   And the engagement part of Twitter,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.000]   find other things that are engaging.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.160]   Read books, watch streaming shows,
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.920]   listen to episode after episode
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.280]   of the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.000]   Do stuff in the real world.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.200]   Make more Harry Potter references.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.020]   I don't know.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.240]   The fact that this is engaging
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.780]   is not enough of a justification
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.620]   for we should keep it around.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.560]   So I don't think Mastodon could replace Twitter,
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.400]   but I don't think we need anything to replace Twitter.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.680]   So let me go back to the conclusion
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.440]   I made in that 2019 article.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.340]   Let's see if I was clairvoyant or not.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:25.120]   So I did say the internet may work better
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.740]   when it's spread out as originally designed.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.000]   So I like this idea of more distributed,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.700]   more niche, less universal.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.280]   But then I conclude, despite its advantages, however,
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.400]   I suspect that the Indie web will not succeed
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.520]   in replacing existing social media platforms
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.740]   at their current scale.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.720]   For one thing, the Indie web lacks
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   the carefully engineered addictiveness
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.080]   that helped fuel the rise of services
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.980]   like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.680]   This addictiveness has kept people returning
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.120]   to their devices even when they know
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.880]   there are better uses for their time.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.200]   Remove the addiction and you might lose the users.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.560]   All right, I think that's just another way
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.260]   of saying what I'm saying today.
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.940]   Those existing giants were fantastically effective
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.280]   at generating engagement.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.300]   Indie social media can't compete.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.580]   Get rid of the engagement,
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.980]   you lose most of the users.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.480]   As I go on to say, though,
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   that's not necessarily a bad thing.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.740]   It may be too that people who are uneasy
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.440]   about social media aren't looking
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.380]   for a better version of it,
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.540]   but are instead ready to permanently reduce
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.620]   the role that their smartphones play in their lives.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.440]   That I think is the most hopeful
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.320]   potential conclusion here is,
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.120]   sure, there's alternatives that can,
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.560]   some people who are into social internet stuff
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.400]   can find actually healthier, more community-driven,
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.320]   more eccentric, original, early web-style
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.640]   online communities, and I'm glad those exist.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.080]   Most people will say if Twitter fell,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.160]   I'm not gonna sign up for a Mastodon instance,
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.080]   and honestly, it's kinda nice to be able
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.560]   to hear the birds again and see the sunshine.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.640]   I'm sorta glad this thing is gone.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.640]   I don't need a replacement.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.900]   So that's where I fall.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.080]   No, we're not gonna see an obvious replacement
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.360]   for Twitter, and I don't care that that might end up
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.620]   being the reality that we go into next.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.600]   I mean, the real question, Jesse,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.600]   is Twitter gonna go away?
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.520]   I'm not convinced.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.760]   It's hard for me to tell.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.280]   - I don't think it's gonna go away.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.720]   - There's issues about engineering.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.520]   This is the conversation right now
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.220]   is because so many people are being fired
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.900]   that it'll literally crash.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.920]   Putting those aside, it's an engagement engine
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.440]   like almost no one else.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.040]   Like for people who are too old,
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.840]   or I'll get yelled at for this,
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.800]   or have too much self-respect to be on TikTok,
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.840]   it's the next most addictive thing to have, right?
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.880]   I mean, it's an incredibly engaging thing,
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.640]   especially if you're a well-educated, upper-middle class,
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.720]   sort of elite knowledge worker type.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.240]   It's put it in my veins engagement.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.520]   It's like, yeah, there's very few things
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.580]   that can compete with that.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.600]   And it's really hard.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   That's my thing is that engagement requires
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.120]   all of these elements to come together.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.680]   And a lot of them relied on first mover advantages.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.680]   237 million users that include all these interesting people,
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.440]   this incredibly valuable social graph,
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.680]   that the interface retweet dynamic
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.120]   that does such a good job of curation.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.860]   It's hard to do that.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.040]   So yeah, I'm kind of with you.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.640]   I mean, unless Musk shuts it down,
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.920]   like the tech crashes and he says enough of it,
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.880]   let's just shut it down,
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.280]   which I don't think is gonna happen.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.600]   - He wouldn't waste $40 billion to do that.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.200]   - Yeah, his debt service on his Twitter acquisition
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.520]   is a billion dollars a year.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.960]   He owes a billion dollars a year
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.080]   just to service the debt on Twitter.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.480]   So I don't think he's gonna do that.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.320]   I think what's gonna happen is,
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.680]   and it's something I talked about a while ago,
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.880]   is that Twitter was actually well positioned
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.520]   to be taken private like he did.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.540]   It could easily be something that generates
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.760]   a couple of billion dollars a year in revenue,
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.260]   pretty sleekly with really high profit margins,
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.320]   which is really all Musk needs out of it.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.600]   So once you lose that ambition that Facebook has
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.920]   to be a trillion dollar valuation company,
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.160]   which was their ambition before the wheels fell off.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.000]   Once you're like,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.180]   "We don't have to be a trillion dollar competitor to Apple."
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.040]   Once it's, "Hey, this thing generates 2.5 billion a year
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.200]   off of 150 million really engaged users
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.760]   and it has a sleek background
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.840]   and we have a 2000 employee company
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.920]   and we can service our debt
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.640]   and it makes good profit for the people who own it."
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.680]   I mean, I'm sure that's the play.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.560]   The question is whether he's all there.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.480]   That's the only eight ball here.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.320]   I don't know.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.600]   It's hard to tell because everything's so negative
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.440]   on Musk right now.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.760]   I mean, if he's literally losing his grip mentally,
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.720]   then God knows what will happen.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.040]   But if we assume a strategic Musk,
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.240]   I don't think it's that hard to make this a sleek,
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.720]   profitable, semi-niche service.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.680]   It's not trying to be TikTok or Facebook.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.960]   It's not trying to be Mastodon.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.200]   It's somewhere in between
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.600]   and generates like a reasonable amount of money
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.560]   for a small number of people.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.160]   That's probably where it'll end up.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.720]   - You should ask your boy, Lex.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.440]   - Yeah.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.260]   Yeah, I should.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.880]   I think Lex is buddies with Elon.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.320]   - Yeah, he's on a show.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.480]   I think they're buddies.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.600]   I'll ask him.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.120]   I'll say, "What's going on here?"
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.960]   All right.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.720]   (upbeat music)
