[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   What's the high level process someone needs to go through?
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.240]   - How do you get good at starting and asking?
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.320]   Those are the two biggest things holding people from back
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.080]   from success in really entrepreneurship, but also in life.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.540]   So how do you practice starting right now?
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.080]   'Cause the more that you can get started
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.600]   and let's say you wanna do a podcast,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.040]   let's put an episode out today.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.680]   I have a YouTube channel, a million subscribers.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.220]   My first video that I did three years ago
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.560]   was with an iPhone 10 and me shirtless.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.560]   Fast forward today, each video costs $20,000 to make,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.440]   but I got started.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.600]   The second thing is asking.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.040]   Everything in life is asking, like your wife,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.120]   you had to ask her to marry you.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.160]   You have to ask for a raise.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.140]   You have to ask for things.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.000]   And so people have a negative connotation of asking
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.920]   and then they have this fear of rejection.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.000]   This really strong fear of, wow, I'm not good enough
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.840]   or they don't like me.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.800]   And the beauty of asking is that you can get what you want.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.840]   If you don't ask, you can't get.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.080]   People never make their million dollars
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.480]   'cause they don't make their first dollar
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.320]   and they're not making their first dollar
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.140]   'cause they don't get started.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.980]   They don't realize it can be fun
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.480]   and you can get started today.
