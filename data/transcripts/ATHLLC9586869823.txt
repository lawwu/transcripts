[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.120]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.840]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm so excited you're here today
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.640]   for an episode all about the hidden benefits
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.080]   you get with your credit cards.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.440]   And when I say hidden benefits,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.160]   I'm not talking about the main perks that cards market,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.840]   like lounge access or free checked bags.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.280]   I'm talking about all the others,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.760]   like travel insurance, purchase protection,
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.640]   which I've used to repair multiple iPhone screens for free,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.880]   and lots of other perks you might not know about,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.360]   like rental car discounts, concierges,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.460]   free wine tastings, free credit scores, and a lot more.
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.400]   I know I've saved thousands of dollars
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.640]   using all these hidden benefits,
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.440]   so I am excited to share them with you
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.560]   so you can do the same.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.160]   But two quick things.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.240]   First, you probably know I've been on a quest
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.640]   to hit 1,000 reviews on Apple Podcasts.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.740]   And as of this recording, I'm at 993.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.720]   So thank you to everyone who's left a rating or a review.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.280]   It means so much to me.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.500]   And if you haven't done it yet
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.200]   and wanna be one of the last few people
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.080]   to help me get over the edge, that would be amazing.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.520]   Second, one of the best travel cards out there,
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.200]   the Chase Sapphire Preferred,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.960]   just increased the signup bonus
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.500]   to 80,000 ultimate rewards points.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.400]   I know many of you already have this card
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.760]   or have the Chase Reserve,
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.680]   but if not, this is a fantastic bonus
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.480]   on a card that earns 3X on dining, streaming,
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.240]   and online groceries, and 2X on travel,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.680]   or 5X on travel if you book in the Chase portal.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.440]   While I've been able to get as much as 4 to 5 cents of value
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.640]   for my Chase points, if I'm being conservative,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.120]   I can value them at 2 cents
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.280]   because of their flexibility to transfer
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.680]   to so many great partners like Hyatt, United, Air France,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.280]   which makes that signup bonus
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.320]   worth at least $1,600 in my eyes.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.860]   Now, I know Chase has a few important rules
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.240]   that I wanna make sure you think about
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.080]   before you think you can just jump in and get this bonus.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.640]   First, as is true for all Chase cards,
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.360]   you can't have more than five cards opened
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.880]   in the last 24 months,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.720]   including being added as an authorized user.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.100]   That's the 5/24 rule,
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.640]   so if you're already at 5/24, you have to wait.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.040]   Second, you can't have more than one Chase Sapphire card,
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.840]   so if you already have the Reserve or the Preferred Now,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.640]   you're gonna need to downgrade to something
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.480]   like the Freedom or the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.400]   and you'll probably wanna wait a few weeks
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.560]   or maybe even one statement cycle before applying again.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.000]   And finally, you can't have earned a Chase Sapphire bonus
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.080]   in the past 48 months,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.480]   which starts when the statement closes
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.560]   that you earn the bonus,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.520]   not when you actually open the card,
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.720]   so it might be a little more like two or three months
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.720]   after when you first opened that card.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.720]   So if given all of that, you're still eligible,
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.080]   this is the best bonus I've seen online for this card,
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.880]   and if you wanna support me in the show,
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.400]   you can sign up at allthehacks.com/cards
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.160]   and use the links there,
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.560]   but as much as I'd love you to use those links,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.080]   I have heard that you can get a 90,000 point bonus
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.280]   on the Sapphire Preferred by applying in a Chase branch.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.360]   It's not a guarantee, it's one of those things
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.340]   where some people have had success and some people haven't,
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.640]   but I want you to get the most points possible,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.520]   so if going to a Chase branch
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.660]   is worth getting those extra 10,000 points and it's nearby,
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.480]   that might be a great option for you to at least try out.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.760]   Okay, those are my two quick announcements,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.800]   let's talk about these credit card benefits
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.860]   right after this.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.360]   Okay, so almost every card out there
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.480]   has a guide to benefits that you get
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.560]   when you first open the card that explains all the benefits.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.720]   It looks like one of those terms and condition docs
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.240]   and many of us just throw them away,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.920]   so you can usually search online to find yours,
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.800]   I'll include a few links in the show notes
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.280]   that'll help you find one,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.240]   and some issuers make it really easy.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.320]   If you just search Chase Sapphire Reserve Guide to Benefits,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.040]   there's a PDF, it's so quick and simple.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.660]   Some make it a little difficult,
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.680]   you might even have to call or send a message
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.360]   to get it, and then there's Capital One,
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.040]   which is a whole different beast,
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.920]   and I honestly didn't actually know this about Capital One
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.560]   until I started preparing for this episode,
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.280]   but when you apply for a Capital One card,
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.680]   you might not actually know
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.320]   whether it's gonna be a Visa or a MasterCard,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.600]   and within those issuers, they have different tiers,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.800]   there's Visa Infinite, Visa Signature,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.040]   MasterCard World, MasterCard World Elite,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.400]   and you don't actually know
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   which one of those cards you're gonna get
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.600]   until you go through the application process
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.680]   and the underwriting and get the card,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.360]   and then you'll find out.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.240]   So when you actually go to look at the list
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.940]   of the Guide to Benefits for Capital One cards,
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.280]   they actually just give you a list that says,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.680]   "Hey, if your card's a MasterCard World Elite,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.400]   "here's the Guide to Benefits,"
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.760]   but you won't know which one it is
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.200]   until you get the card and are approved for it.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.920]   So Capital One makes it extra difficult.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.240]   As I go through this episode,
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.760]   I would love to be able to tell you
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.720]   for every specific card what perks
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.160]   and what benefits you have,
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.240]   and it would be amazing if I could somehow custom use AI
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.800]   to automatically generate the content in this episode
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.000]   just for you and your cards, but we're not there yet,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.120]   so I'm gonna do my best
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.680]   to tell you everything you need to know,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.280]   and I'll put as many links in the show notes
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.720]   as I can to help out.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.400]   First, I'm gonna start with purchase benefits.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.060]   For so many cards, there are a ton of benefits you get
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.520]   anytime you buy something with your card,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.440]   and the requirement is usually only
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.360]   that you put the cost of the purchase on your card,
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.640]   and all these claims that you might have to do
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.000]   to get money back are pretty easy to do online.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.880]   I've filed at least four or five
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.800]   purchase protection benefit claims online
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.400]   and have been reimbursed well over $1,000,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.880]   so it's definitely worth taking advantage of these
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.360]   if you wanna make sure that you're getting
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.200]   the most out of your credit cards
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.960]   for the next time you have an opportunity.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.800]   And just to be clear,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.680]   when I say put the purchase on your card,
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.800]   that's important because if you're buying something
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.440]   on Amazon and you end up using your Amazon gift card
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.200]   instead of using your credit card,
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.240]   you're not gonna get all these perks,
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.480]   and for some of these protections,
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.440]   the amount that you're able to be reimbursed
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.160]   is limited by the amount you put on the card,
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.540]   and others, it's just a requirement
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.120]   that you put a purchase of any amount on the card.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.440]   So for example, for a lot of the travel protection benefits,
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.520]   as long as some aspect of the purchase is on your card,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.240]   that could even mean just the taxes and fees
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.400]   of a ticket that you bought with miles, you're covered.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.560]   For some things, you might need to put
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.360]   the entire purchase on if you wanna maximize the benefit.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.200]   The first benefit I wanna talk about is purchase protection.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.760]   This is one of my favorites
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.360]   because it means you can get reimbursed
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.880]   to repair or replace items that you bought on your card
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.880]   that get stolen or damaged within 90 to 120 days of purchase
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.640]   depending on the card you have.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.240]   This is a common benefit offered on so many different cards,
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.580]   and it usually requires the entire purchase
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.920]   to be on the card, and is often limited
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.960]   to up to $10,000 per item and up to $50,000 per year,
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.200]   which is a lot.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.880]   Now, there are a ton of exclusions
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.680]   for things like animals, software, perishables, vehicles,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.280]   but most common purchases like electronics
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.600]   or home goods are covered.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.440]   I've used purchase protection to replace an SD card
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.120]   that I ran through a washing machine
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.420]   to repair at least three cracked iPhone screens.
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.240]   Note that normally the screen needs to have been cracked
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.760]   within three to four months of the original purchase.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.240]   However, one time I actually cracked my phone screen
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.200]   nine months after I bought the phone, so it wasn't covered.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.840]   But then I managed to drop my phone again
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.100]   and crack the screen just a few weeks later,
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.000]   and so I was able to get the second repair covered
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.280]   by pointing out that the screen that was cracked
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.400]   wasn't the original phone that was nine months ago,
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.360]   it was the screen that I had bought a few weeks ago
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.900]   as a replacement.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.540]   So I know that might seem a little crazy,
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.280]   but when there's a few hundred dollars on the line,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.600]   it's definitely worth trying to see
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.800]   if you can make it happen.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.160]   Also, I promise, I don't really break my screen
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.600]   as much as this might seem.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.760]   I've probably done it three or four times in my life,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.960]   but it just happens that I take advantage
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.000]   of this perk all the time, and for some reason,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.720]   it seems like it always breaks
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.600]   within 90 days of buying the phone.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.720]   Also, if you're outside of that 90-day window,
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.320]   later in this episode, I'm gonna cover cell phone coverage,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.400]   which actually might cover you, but with a deductible,
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.240]   whereas Purchase Protection has no deductible.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.080]   So that's Purchase Protection, definitely an awesome perk.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.360]   Another one I love is Extended Warranty.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.920]   This is another common benefit
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.560]   that increases the manufacturer's warranty of an item
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.480]   by an additional year, or on a lot of city cards,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.640]   by an additional two years.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.480]   So similar to Purchase Protection,
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.000]   it's often limited to $10,000 on an item
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.880]   or $50,000 in a year.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.960]   This is something that's come in handy for me,
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.180]   especially with things like a computer.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.680]   I bought a MacBook Pro a handful of years ago,
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.840]   and sometime in year two,
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.480]   after Apple's one-year warranty was up,
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.680]   something went wrong.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.000]   And Apple, of course, was gonna charge me to fix it
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.320]   because it was outside of the warranty,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.200]   and I didn't pay for AppleCare,
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.240]   but I used the Extended Warranty Protection on my card,
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.100]   and that covered the cost to repair the computer.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.880]   In researching this, I didn't actually realize
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.960]   that city cards had two years of additional warranty.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.380]   So if I were gonna buy something like a computer
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.880]   where the cost to repair it in years two or three
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.120]   could be pretty expensive,
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.640]   I'd probably prioritize putting that on a card,
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.800]   like a city card,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.000]   so that I could get the Extended Warranty Protection
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.160]   for two years, even if it meant getting less points,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160]   because it's just, I like that safety,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.880]   and the only other alternative
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.400]   is paying for something like AppleCare,
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.560]   which is gonna cost way more
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.920]   than the points I would otherwise get.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.520]   There's also a benefit called Return Protection.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.920]   It's a commonly offered perk
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.760]   that extends the return window of something,
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.520]   or even creates a return policy where one didn't exist,
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.120]   either because the retailer doesn't accept returns
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.040]   or something was final sale.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.320]   I actually haven't used this benefit yet,
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.280]   but in the past, I've probably been hesitant
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.280]   to buy things that are final sale,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.040]   thinking, "Oh, if I actually don't like this,
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.760]   "there'll be no way to return it."
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.700]   And I don't think I need to be worried about that anymore,
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.600]   as long as I put it on a card with Return Protection.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.080]   No, however, Return Protection,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.920]   unlike Purchase Protection, Extended Warranty,
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.680]   usually has much lower limits than other benefits,
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.640]   often 250, $300 per item,
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.960]   and usually caps out at around $1,000 a year.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.680]   So that's one I haven't tried yet, but stay tuned if I do.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.280]   The last one in this group is called Price Protection.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.760]   It's much less common now that a lot of cards
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.280]   have been taking it away,
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.360]   but it reimburses you the difference
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.000]   when the price of something you purchased
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.280]   drops within a few months.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.560]   It was really common,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.600]   and now it's only on a handful of cards,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.320]   mostly obscure ones that I don't think are very common,
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.000]   like the UBS Visa Infinite card.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Some Capital One cards actually do have this perk,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.760]   but I can't tell you which ones,
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.640]   because as I mentioned before,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.280]   it's a perk tied to a specific type of card,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.440]   like a MasterCard World Elite,
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.280]   but I don't actually know if that's the card that you have,
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.840]   because you might have a Quicksilver card
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.480]   that is a MasterCard World Elite,
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.720]   while someone else might have that exact same card,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.120]   and it's just a regular Visa Signature card.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.760]   So you're gonna have to look up
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.520]   whether your Capital One card has this
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.960]   by going to the Guide to Benefits.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.640]   I'll link to that in the show notes,
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.480]   and matching it up with which kind of card you have.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.320]   One hack, if you're not eligible for this,
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.440]   I have had so much luck chatting, or emailing,
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.960]   or even calling a retailer to just ask them
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.320]   to refund the difference when a price drops,
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.520]   especially if it's within the return window
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.800]   of buying something.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.240]   Most retailers would much prefer to just give you $10 back,
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.280]   then have you send something back,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.680]   then repurchase it to save $10,
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.640]   because they're probably gonna spend
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.000]   more than that in shipping.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.900]   So that's an option if you want some price protection,
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.700]   and you can't actually get it from a card.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.800]   Now, all these benefits, like I said,
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.860]   you need to put the purchase on the card,
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.600]   so I'm really cognizant when I'm buying something
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.120]   to make sure I'm not using gift cards
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   if I want these benefits to kick in.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.400]   So if someone gives me an Amazon gift card,
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.940]   I'm much more likely to use that Amazon gift card
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.760]   to buy groceries with Amazon Fresh
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.140]   than I am to buy electronic product
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.840]   that I might wanna use these perks for,
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.680]   because I'm really not expecting to be able to need
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.040]   extended warranty protection on bananas,
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.960]   or anything else I'm buying from the grocery store.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.680]   So that's one thing to keep in mind,
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.200]   especially with things like if you're buying something
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.180]   and you wanna try to get an even better deal,
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.200]   so you're gonna buy gift cards.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.760]   I know I always talk about the strategy
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.620]   of buying gift cards at the grocery store,
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.080]   so you can get 4X points with an Amex Gold.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.400]   Keep in mind that for some things that's fine,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.720]   but if you're buying gift cards
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   so that you can buy things to get these benefits,
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.520]   you might not get those benefits
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.080]   if you're paying with a gift card.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.400]   Now, you could potentially read the terms and conditions,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.060]   see whether it's capped at the purchase price or not.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.660]   If not, then make sure you put at least some
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.280]   of the purchase on your card.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.440]   So that's one big category of benefits I've used a ton.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.980]   It is astonishing how much of our personal information
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.220]   is online, and in the last few months,
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.800]   I've been trying to remove as much of Amy
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.940]   and my info as possible.
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.820]   I also did the same for our parents,
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.940]   and in total, after reviewing over 20,000 listings,
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.940]   we found over 1,000 pieces
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.220]   of personally identifiable information.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.180]   Thankfully, it's all getting removed,
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.380]   and instead of spending 50-plus hours
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.740]   searching and filing requests to do that,
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.240]   it only took a few minutes
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.300]   because I used Delete.me from Abine,
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.100]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.340]   with them for this episode.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.140]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.420]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.220]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.580]   but they'll continuously scan for new data
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.980]   that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.900]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.280]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.780]   in their first two years,
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.220]   and to date, they've removed
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.600]   over 35 million pieces of data for their customers.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.660]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.160]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.220]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.700]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.680]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.060]   With Mother's Day around the corner,
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.700]   I'd be crazy not to share an absolutely amazing gift idea,
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.940]   which also happens to be one of my favorite brands as well.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.540]   It's something Amy and I use almost every day,
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.940]   and I know it would make a great gift for anyone.
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.780]   But what is it?
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.200]   Well, it's really anything Viore makes.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.980]   They're one of my all-time favorite brands,
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.460]   and I'm so excited to be partnering
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.900]   with them for this episode.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.340]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.360]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.900]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all,
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.500]   and it is so freaking comfortable
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.220]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.560]   I know because I do wear it all the time.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.740]   In fact, I'm wearing my Sunday Performance Joggers
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.820]   and a Strato Tech Tee right now,
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.100]   and like I said, it's not just for men.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.220]   My wife will vouch that everything she's bought,
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.380]   from their joggers to their hoodies to their tops,
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.200]   have been an amazing purchase.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.060]   I think at least half of our weekly wardrobe is Viore
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.100]   because their products are incredibly versatile
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.500]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.380]   whether it's running, training, or yoga,
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.420]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.260]   and they even have polos, button-downs,
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.180]   and nice pants you can wear for work or a night out.

[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.220]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/V-U-O-R-E,
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.420]   and get yourself or your loved one
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.680]   some of the most comfortable
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.960]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.920]   Another one that is really common on a lot of cards
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.180]   is all of the travel benefits you get.
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.360]   There are a lot of different types of coverages.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.380]   I haven't tested most of these,
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.760]   but I've definitely heard enough success stories
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.860]   that I wouldn't hesitate to rely on them
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.680]   and file a claim if you wanna make sure
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.760]   you get some money back.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.720]   Most travel cards have these, except Citi,
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.760]   because Citi cut all the travel benefits
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.300]   from their cards a few years ago.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.820]   First, one of the most common ones is rental car coverage.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.140]   So first off, if you already have auto coverage
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.980]   for your own vehicle,
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.980]   that coverage will likely carry over to a rental car.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.060]   Though, if you're renting a more expensive car
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.280]   than you drive, you might wanna supplement it.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.260]   And also, if you're filing a claim on a rental car
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.460]   using your auto insurance company,
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.180]   it's very likely that those rates
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.940]   on your auto insurance might go up,
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.740]   so I personally don't like to rely on that as an option.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.080]   Also, when you're renting overseas,
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.340]   your US insurance might not cover you at all.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.820]   So, given all of this,
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.060]   I always try to make sure I have some type
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.140]   of rental car insurance on a car I'm renting
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.620]   that isn't relying on my personal auto insurance.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.100]   And I do that by using a card
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.700]   that offers primary rental car insurance.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.640]   It's very common on a lot of cards,
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.500]   Chase Sapphires, Capital One Venture,
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.360]   Venture X, Built Rewards.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.700]   It is notably not included with most Amex cards.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.980]   To get primary rental car coverage with an Amex card,
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.900]   you're gonna need to pay for premium rental car protection.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.900]   And while it's probably a much better deal
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.100]   than paying the rental car company for coverage,
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.800]   it does cost about 12 to $25 per rental,
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.220]   so I'm not using my Amex cards to rent cars.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.220]   I will also point out that once you turn on
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.820]   premium rental car protection on an Amex,
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.620]   every time your card is used at a rental car company,
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.820]   whether you want that rental car protection or not,
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.020]   it gets automatically added, so be careful there.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.300]   And to be clear, the difference between
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.740]   primary and secondary coverage,
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.900]   because there are a lot of cards
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.140]   that also have secondary coverage,
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.340]   is that with secondary coverage,
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.300]   it kicks in only if all of your other insurance policies
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.180]   don't cover the accident.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.460]   So for me, like I said,
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.820]   I don't wanna have to reach out to our insurance carrier,
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.300]   which is USAA, if we get in an accident,
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.260]   so I'm looking for a card
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.500]   that has primary rental car coverage.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.940]   And all you need to do for this coverage to kick in
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.180]   is decline the collision damage waiver
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.740]   when you rent the car
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.940]   and put the whole rental car on your card.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.900]   However, there is one important caveat.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.260]   Collision damage waiver is the type of insurance
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.140]   when you rent a car that covers damage to the car.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.340]   There is another type of coverage called liability coverage,
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.580]   which covers damage that you do
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.820]   while driving the car to someone else.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.620]   Credit cards are not going to cover your liability coverage,
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.060]   and that's what you're gonna need to rely
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.540]   on your auto insurance for.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.900]   Depending on the state you rent a rental car in,
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.740]   it might by default come with liability coverage,
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.460]   though the limits might be very low.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.740]   And in other states, it might not be there at all.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.500]   So you can't rely on your credit card for liability.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.260]   And if you don't have your own auto insurance,
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.380]   because maybe you don't own a car at all,
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.700]   I would definitely make sure
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.900]   that you either get liability coverage
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.380]   from the rental car company,
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.900]   or you can actually get a non-owner's auto insurance coverage
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.420]   that's fairly inexpensive,
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.500]   that will cover you when you're renting a car for liability.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.900]   That's rental car coverage.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.940]   It's an awesome perk.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.620]   Every time I rent a car, I always decline the coverage,
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.380]   and I rely on my Venturax or my Chase Sapphire Reserve.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.240]   Next is delayed luggage.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.800]   So I've only seen this on Chase cards,
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.140]   but definitely check your guide to benefits.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.200]   It covers the cost of anything you need
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.660]   when your bag is delayed.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.860]   Change of clothes, toiletries.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.380]   It usually requires your bag to be delayed at least six hours
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.580]   and covers you up to $100 a day,
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.740]   which is probably less than you're gonna be able to get
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.560]   if you really push the airline,
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.700]   but it's nice to have there as a backup.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.940]   There's also lost and damaged baggage coverage,
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.500]   which is common on Chase and Amex cards.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.420]   It's also secondary as a backup
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.980]   to whatever the airline provides
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.900]   if your bag gets lost or damaged or stolen,
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.560]   but it usually covers the cost of the contents
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.980]   and replacing or repairing the baggage itself.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.380]   Now, most policies have a maximum coverage
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.180]   of anywhere from 500 to $3,000 a person,
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.940]   and all that you need to do is make sure
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.100]   that the flight that you took was booked on the card.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.300]   And for a lot of these,
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.740]   the flight doesn't have to be entirely on the card
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.140]   if you book it with miles
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.020]   and you pay just the taxes and fees that'll cover it,
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.520]   or if you use a credit for part of it
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.940]   and put the rest on your card,
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.940]   but definitely read into it, but that's normally the case.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.700]   There's also trip delay coverage,
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.140]   which is another common coverage
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.100]   on many travel and rewards cards
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.420]   that'll reimburse you for any additional reasonable expenses
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.820]   that occur as a result of the trip delay.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.000]   That could be your flight gets delayed or canceled
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.040]   and you have to rebook something else.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.260]   Most cards require a delay of at least six to 12 hours,
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.380]   and the coverage is usually capped at about $500 a person.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.700]   Now, there's also trip cancellation
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.320]   and interruption insurance,
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.780]   which will provide reimbursement for non-refundable
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.780]   or prepaid travel expenses
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.960]   when you have to cancel or change your trip
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.780]   due to a covered situation.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.700]   Those covered situations typically include
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.140]   most major medical situations or injuries,
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.340]   severe weather, named storms,
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.740]   jury duty that can't be postponed,
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.420]   death or the hospitalization of travelers,
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.660]   and sometimes, depending on the policy, family members.
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.380]   Now, for the pandemic, many of us learned
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.380]   that this doesn't include pandemics.
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.620]   It also doesn't include
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.760]   if you just don't wanna take the trip,
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.500]   but this coverage is common on many travel and rewards cards.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.940]   It usually covers anywhere from three to $10,000 per person,
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.340]   but do note Capital One does offer this,
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.900]   but their covered situation list is much, much smaller
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.620]   and is primarily only for major medical situations
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.340]   or injuries to a traveler.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.140]   So depending on the card you have
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.420]   and depending on the kind of protection you want,
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.200]   this is where travel insurance could come into play
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.700]   as something you wanna get.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.000]   But when I think about all of these perks,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.400]   and there's still actually a few more,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.420]   it begs the question of do you need travel insurance
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.660]   and what do you need it to cover?
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.300]   And so I wanna do more in a future episode
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.540]   about travel insurance
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.960]   because there are things like canceling for any reason
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.680]   or pandemics that you might want to supplement,
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.140]   but at least know that if your card
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.620]   has these kinds of coverages,
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.980]   you are protected for many situations.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.480]   Another one is emergency evacuation insurance.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.180]   So if you're in need of serious medical attention,
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.740]   this benefit covers the cost of transportation
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.420]   to the nearest medical facility capable of proper care.
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.460]   Now, this probably isn't necessary
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.500]   on a trip to Paris or Tokyo,
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.660]   but if you're on safari in Africa or in a remote island,
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.440]   it could be really, really expensive to get you
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.780]   from wherever you get injured
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.180]   or have something happen to you
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.340]   to a quality medical center.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.660]   The Amex Platinum is the most generous card
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.020]   for this benefit that I've seen.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.020]   There's no cap on the cost
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.660]   and they don't even require you
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.660]   to have used the card to pay for your trip.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.420]   Other cards like the Chase Sapphire have a cap
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.580]   and they require you to have paid
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.140]   for at least part of the trip with your card.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.420]   And while many of these benefits
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.220]   can be claimed after the fact,
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.340]   this is one where you absolutely need to coordinate
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.900]   with the card benefits team before using it.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.140]   For anyone that hasn't looked into
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.180]   what emergency evacuation flights would cost,
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.580]   these can often go into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.460]   So definitely don't just book a flight like that
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.940]   and expect to get reimbursed.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.180]   Definitely call the card issuer
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.140]   and make sure that you can coordinate everything in advance.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.220]   Next, I'll talk about accident insurance.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.920]   While I don't know anyone who's ever used this coverage,
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.640]   the ideas that it would pay out in the case of death
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.940]   or losing eyesight or a limb
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.700]   while on travel booked with your card,
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.500]   the coverage varies widely by cards.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.060]   Some cards don't offer it at all, like Amex.
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.980]   Chase offers up to a million dollars in coverage
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.940]   and there are some exclusions about things happening
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.820]   when cars and taxis,
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.140]   but hopefully this never comes into play.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.540]   In some of these coverages, I hope you don't have trip delays,
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.100]   I hope you don't have to be evacuated,
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.100]   but I just wanna make sure you at least know
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.940]   of all the benefits that are in there related to travel.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.420]   Finally, not necessarily on the insurance side,
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.460]   but while we're on the topic of travel,
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.900]   most travel cards that have an annual fee over about $300
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.780]   include some type of lounge access.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.500]   If you have a branded airline card,
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.540]   it's usually access to that airline's lounge.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.380]   Otherwise, it's almost always access to a priority pass,
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.340]   which is a set of lounges you can use
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.660]   while you're traveling.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.780]   There isn't actually much benefit
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.980]   to having multiple of these,
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.860]   although some people listening might have two or three cards
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.420]   that offer priority pass.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.980]   It is worth noting that there are subtle differences
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.140]   on the types of lounge access you get.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.740]   For example, the Platinum card from Amex
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.900]   also includes access to Amex Centurion lounges
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.260]   and some other lounges in their network,
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.180]   but their priority pass membership
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.900]   doesn't include getting credit and reimbursement
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.740]   at priority pass restaurants,
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.860]   whereas I believe Capital One does include that.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.980]   So whenever you get any of these cards,
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.580]   make sure you activate the priority pass benefit.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.580]   You can link it up in the priority pass app
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.620]   and see what you have access to.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.180]   But definitely when traveling,
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.420]   if you have a card with a high annual fee,
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.260]   make sure you're taking advantage of the fact
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.540]   that you probably get access to lounges
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.500]   when you're traveling in most major airports.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.980]   Another common benefit of cards with a higher annual fee
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.460]   is a free Global Entry or TSA Pre.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.080]   If you travel and you're eligible
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.260]   for TSA Pre and Global Entry and you haven't enrolled,
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.960]   you really should consider it.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.940]   There are 37 different cards that cover the cost
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.940]   of getting TSA Pre or Global Entry,
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.220]   so it's very possible you have a card that offers this.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.180]   And since many people have multiple cards
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.220]   that cover this cost,
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.880]   it might not even be hard to find someone
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.540]   that could do it for you.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.500]   One important thing to know,
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.060]   if you have Global Entry, you get TSA Pre included,
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.300]   so I definitely recommend doing Global Entry
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.300]   instead of TSA Pre so that you can skip the lines
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.100]   coming back into the United States.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.580]   Those memberships usually last for five years,
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.500]   so the perk usually only is eligible to be used
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.140]   once every four years.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.860]   So don't think that just because you have it,
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.860]   you can use it every year for you and your family members.
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.060]   You'll need to use it once every four years.
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.500]   Now, I know one of the challenges with that
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.020]   is actually finding a Global Entry appointment.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.680]   So to solve that, definitely check out Appointment Scanner.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.640]   It is an awesome product that monitors
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.060]   all the different Global Entry appointment times
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.940]   and sends you an alert right away as soon as one opens.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.900]   Sometimes it looks like there might not be appointment
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.140]   for six months, but I know in my experience,
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.200]   even though that was the case,
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.760]   I don't even think there was a single appointment
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.960]   any time at San Francisco Airport.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.460]   I signed up for Appointment Scanner.
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.580]   Within the first day,
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.500]   I was able to get an appointment that week.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.020]   So it was a really awesome service.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.220]   You do have to be able to jump on top
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.180]   of making those appointments
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.100]   the second you get the notification,
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.100]   but they support email and text, so that's a great option.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.280]   One other thing that I recently learned,
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.060]   which I haven't been able to test yet,
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.940]   is if you have Global Entry and you log in,
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.980]   there's a thing called the APEC Business Travel Card.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.580]   It's a reciprocal program
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.160]   as part of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation,
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.980]   and it facilitates short-term business travel
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.560]   within the APEC region, which is most of Asia
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.000]   and Australia, New Zealand, as well as Mexico.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.280]   It's kind of an interesting thing
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.000]   that I've been told is a really great travel hack
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.360]   if you're eligible.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.240]   So it costs $70, but if you have a card
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.540]   that reimburses Global Entry,
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.320]   or maybe you even have more than one,
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.040]   you could use this to cover that fee.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.940]   And the idea is if you are traveling for business
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.580]   to these regions, then you are eligible to apply
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.580]   and get an APEC Business Travel Card.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.300]   Now, you need to go to an interview
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.580]   and you need to show documentation
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.020]   that you actually do travel for business to these regions
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.500]   for reasons that are included,
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.200]   which are many different reasons.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.100]   And in return, you're able to skip
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.540]   through most of the immigration lines
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.740]   in all of these countries
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.860]   and use the diplomatic and crew lines
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.120]   to cut through immigration.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.760]   It's supposed to only apply to the individual with the card,
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.560]   but if you read through some of the forums,
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.220]   I'll link to them on Flyer Talk,
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.780]   there are people that in some countries
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.360]   have had success having their family come with them.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.800]   Definitely something that if I start to do
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.840]   more business travel to Asia.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.120]   One more travel perk that most of these premium cards offer
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.120]   is around hotel collections.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.440]   So Capital One, Visa, MasterCard, and Amex
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.020]   all have their own hotel collections.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.560]   And depending on the program,
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.880]   it might be a few hundred hotels or a few thousand hotels.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.720]   And depending on the type of card,
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.400]   you're probably gonna get a set of perks
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.760]   that looks like this.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.240]   You get early check-in, late checkout, upgrades,
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.640]   all those being of course, if available.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.360]   And then you'll usually also get free breakfast
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.040]   and some type of property credit
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.640]   that's often just $100 that you can use in the spa
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.760]   or the restaurant or something like that.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.160]   So the way this all works
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.680]   is that hotels really value channels
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.640]   who have high value customers.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.720]   Credit card companies do that, and so do travel agents.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.960]   And so if you book through the right travel agent
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.680]   or the right credit card portal platform,
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.040]   you're gonna get all those perks I just mentioned.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.480]   When you're booking high-end hotels,
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.480]   four and a half, five-star hotels
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.980]   where the room rate is 300 to $1,000 a night and up,
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.520]   they do this 'cause they wanna build
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.600]   a deeper and longer term relationship
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.340]   with those booking channels.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.480]   Now, from my experience
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.400]   and talking to people in the industry,
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.200]   the highest likelihood of those perks like upgrades,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.800]   confirming is to go through travel agents,
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.700]   not through the hotel portal.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.900]   Not to mention that if you go through the right agent,
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.900]   there's probably somewhere around two to 4,000 hotels
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.900]   that you can get all of those benefits and perks at.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.440]   And most of the property collections
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.320]   linked to the credit cards.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.120]   So I think Visa has about 200,
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.400]   Amex has about 1,000, are a little bit smaller.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.640]   So I partnered with Savanti,
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.840]   which is a company that multiple-time guest,
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.080]   Lee Rowan manages, who has those relationships.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.480]   And so if you're looking to book a luxury hotel,
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.600]   we have a collection of over 4,000 high-end,
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.280]   four or five-star hotels around the world
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.000]   where you can get all those perks.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.900]   Breakfast for two, property credit, free Wi-Fi,
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.120]   upgrade, early check-in, late check-out.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.500]   So if you wanna take advantage of that,
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.580]   you can use the credit card platforms by all means.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.240]   But if you wanna potentially get more access
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.880]   to more hotels and support me and Lee,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.200]   you could just head on over to allthehacks.com/upgrade
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.840]   and I have details of how the whole thing works right there.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.920]   Last on the travel side, aside from all of those benefits,
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.900]   many cards offer different types of travel discounts
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.680]   that are worth checking out.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.660]   For example, Visa Infinite cards,
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.200]   like the Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.720]   get you up to 30% off on Avis, Hertz,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.720]   National, and Silver Car.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.360]   World Elite MasterCards, like the Citi Premier,
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.520]   give you status and discounts with Hertz, Sixth, and Avis.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.120]   And the Amex Platinum offers you status and discounts
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.240]   with Avis, Hertz, and National.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.160]   So as you can see, depending on the type of card you have,
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.800]   you might get a bunch of different benefits.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.680]   Now, most of the benefits and perks
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.440]   that I've talked about so far in this episode
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.320]   fall into those two big buckets
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.960]   of different types of purchase benefits and protections
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.820]   and travel benefits and protections.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.640]   And most cards with annual fee, except Citi,
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.240]   have perks in both of those categories.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.640]   Depending on the card, you might get more or less,
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.480]   but there are a bunch of other benefits
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.720]   that I wanna run through that I think are super interesting
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.900]   that don't apply to all cards,
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.960]   but I think that are worth going through.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.400]   You all know I love credit card points,
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.340]   so I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.960]   which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.720]   It's a free app that helps you manage
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.900]   all of your credit cards in one place
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.020]   and makes it easy to find the right card
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.640]   to maximize your category bonuses on every purchase.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.860]   You can also load it on your partner's phone
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.840]   so they always know the best cards to use.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.820]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.260]   and recurring credit from over 5,000 cards,
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:20.100]   and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase,
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.460]   Bank of America, or Citibank offers
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.940]   to save even more money every day.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.460]   And with their browser extension,
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.240]   you can actually activate every single Amex
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.660]   and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.140]   And because of that massive credit card database,
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.660]   you can do all of this without having to give up
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.180]   any personal or banking details.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.980]   The app is free to download,
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.380]   and many of the features are free as well,
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.140]   but if you wanna try out the pro version,
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.460]   there's a free trial.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.260]   And if you decide you wanna sign up after the trial,
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.920]   which you probably will,
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.880]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.580]   to get 20% off.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:01.580]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:06.580]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.980]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.860]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.980]   for a good hang.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.060]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.020]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.940]   and let our sponsor Drizly,
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.900]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.660]   take care of the supplies.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.480]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.340]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.760]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.720]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.200]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.280]   that you got through another week.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.380]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.920]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.680]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.780]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.440]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.020]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.000]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.020]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.860]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.940]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.580]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:04.040]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.700]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.980]   download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.980]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.240]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.140]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.620]   and supporting the show.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.440]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.160]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.920]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.480]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.840]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.740]   So first, let's talk about a fun one
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.980]   that's near my neck of the woods,
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.000]   and it's free wine tastings in Sonoma.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.760]   So in Northern California, there's a Sonoma wine region.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.800]   It's very close to Napa, but different.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.640]   And if you have a Visa signature or Visa Infinite card,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.960]   you get two for one tastings and $1 ground shipping
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.060]   from 50 plus wineries in Sonoma.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.440]   I'm gonna put a link to the map of all the wineries,
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.200]   as well as a link to all the details in the program.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.440]   But that is an awesome thing.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.880]   If you're up in wine country,
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.000]   I definitely recommend you use a Visa signature
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.200]   or Infinite card to get a deal.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.680]   I have done that a ton.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   Another one that is pretty common
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.360]   that I think is super helpful
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.440]   if you're outside of the 90-day window
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.380]   for purchase protection is your cell phone coverage.
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.320]   So depending on the card you have, if it has this perk,
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.120]   there's usually a 25 to $100 deductible,
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:29.340]   and it covers up to 800 to $1,000 in damages or repairs
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.200]   twice a year for any phone on your plan,
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.640]   as long as you pay for that plan's monthly bill
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.800]   on your card.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.560]   Now, I know with Verizon, they give you $10 a month discount
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.160]   if you pay with a debit card or their credit card.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.400]   So you're gonna have to do the math
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.160]   on whether you'd prefer saving that $10 per line
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.720]   per month each month or putting it on a credit card
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.280]   and getting protection from cell phone coverage.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.800]   So this is a great option.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.320]   I know that Venture X, the Built Rewards,
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.080]   Amex Platinum, Chase Freedom Flex,
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.400]   Chase Inc Business Preferred all have this perk.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.220]   Notably, the Chase Sapphire cards do not.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.920]   So they are not cards that I put my cell phone bill on
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.000]   because I wanna make sure that I get this protection.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.540]   Another one that I've talked about a ton in the past
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:14.280]   is all of the shopping discounts that you get on the portal
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.340]   that are kind of like cash back or points back.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.120]   So every single issuer has a different collection
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.760]   of these merchant offers,
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.680]   and they can be a lot more valuable than you think.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.960]   I looked at my Amex offers and across all of my cards,
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.040]   I've earned almost $1,000 back
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.880]   through different rebates from purchases
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.700]   at places like Home Depot, Best Buy, Delta, and Marriott.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.000]   The offers actually vary by card.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.100]   So if you have multiple cards, it's worth checking each one.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.500]   And if you're new to these offers,
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.000]   I'll put a link in the show notes
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.960]   to how they work on Chase and Amex, Citi, and CapOne.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.500]   There are a bunch, they change all the time.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.080]   But if it's a pain for you to go monitor all of this,
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.240]   I definitely recommend checking out the Card Pointers app.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.680]   If you install the Card Pointers extension on your browser,
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.100]   it will actually auto enroll you in all of these perks.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.600]   And you don't have to go in manually and select them.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.760]   And the extra benefit is that
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.580]   if you have multiple cards on Amex or Chase,
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.280]   when you activate one of these benefits,
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.040]   so sometimes I've seen ones where it's like $100 off
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.860]   a $300 Delta purchase,
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.120]   which is great if you have a bunch of Delta flights.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.880]   But as soon as you activate it on one card,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.700]   you can't activate it on the other.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.740]   But Card Pointers actually activates them
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.480]   at the exact same time across your cards.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.640]   So you end up being able to use those offers
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.040]   more than once, which is amazing.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.240]   So definitely check out Card Pointers.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.680]   You will need to use the pro version of Card Pointers,
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.280]   which has a free trial.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.760]   But the biggest discount he's ever offered
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.020]   is to All The Hacks listeners and members.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:45.900]   So if you're a listener,
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.860]   you can get 30% off at allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.860]   And if you're a member of the podcast,
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.980]   which you can do at allthehacks.com/join
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.700]   until the end of April, so you only have a few more days,
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.220]   you can get 50% off Card Pointers Pro.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.780]   So huge shout out to Emmanuel,
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.620]   who I know listens to the show for supporting the community
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.220]   and giving everybody a discount.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.100]   It's really awesome.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.020]   I love this app.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.820]   I use it to add all of these offers.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.640]   And multiple times, I've ended up getting cash back
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.340]   on things that I didn't even know
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.320]   that I had added as an offer.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.600]   So that's a great one.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.000]   They also have shopping portals for every card
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.760]   that's similar to these offers,
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.960]   but where you can go and click through links
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   to go buy things at retailers like Nike or Apple
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.320]   and earn points and miles with your credit card programs.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.240]   I always go to Cashback Monitor,
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.320]   which lets you compare for any retailer
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.600]   where you're gonna get the most rewards.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.100]   So if you're buying something from Nike,
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.120]   it might be cool that you can get two chase points
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.360]   per dollar you spend,
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.480]   but it might be better to get 10% cash back on Rakuten.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.640]   Another perk is concierges.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.480]   So most travel rewards cards
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.160]   offer a 24/7 concierge service
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.380]   that you can use things like restaurant reservations,
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.860]   vacation requests, personal shopping, or event tickets.
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:00.480]   And while I probably don't use them as much as I could,
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.140]   there is one request that I often use them for,
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.380]   and that's making a reservation in a foreign country
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.520]   where they might have someone local on their team
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.040]   that can speak that language.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.800]   I've also used them in the past to do some basic research,
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.200]   like find a store in San Francisco
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.460]   that's open on a Sunday
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.620]   that sells an inflatable balloon with a number one.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.160]   I'll send some links in the show notes with some articles
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.120]   that might give you a little bit of inspiration,
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.440]   but many of the travel cards cover this.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.440]   In fact, now's probably a decent time to kind of explain
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.560]   where a lot of these perks come from.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.400]   So on the MasterCard and the Visa side,
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.760]   there are three tiers of cards
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.000]   within those payment networks.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.540]   So on the MasterCard side, there's standard,
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.240]   there's world and world elite,
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.180]   and on the Visa side,
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.680]   there's traditional, signature, and infinite.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.920]   And then Amex has its own system
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.200]   that's unique to each card,
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.320]   so there's not a specific tiering system within Amex.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.360]   And a lot of these perks are tied to those tiers
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.100]   within the payment network.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.400]   So MasterCard world elite has a concierge,
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.960]   Visa infinite, Visa signature has a concierge,
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.760]   and a lot of the benefits here,
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.280]   like I mentioned in the wine tasting,
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.940]   those are benefits of Visa signature and Visa infinite.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.960]   So just something to understand how this works,
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.720]   and like I mentioned with Capital One,
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.840]   you might not know what tier you're in
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.000]   until you actually get your card and look at it,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.840]   but the card on Visas above the Visa logo
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.580]   will say signature or infinite,
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.620]   and then on MasterCard, either near the logo or on the back,
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.400]   you'll see world or world elite.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.200]   So a few other perks that come with those programs
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.160]   that are really relevant
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.320]   to getting the most out of your credit cards.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.560]   On the shopping side, World Elite MasterCards
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.280]   and a lot of American Express cards
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.200]   get you a free membership to ShopRunner,
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.040]   which is a site that just gives you free two-day shipping
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.400]   and return shipping on over 100 different retailers,
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.280]   like Saks and Allbirds and CB2 and Under Armour.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.480]   So I'll put a link in the show notes
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.480]   where you can sign up for that.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.640]   I know I've used that in the past
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.800]   to get free, faster shipping.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.400]   And then there's a service called Shipt,
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.240]   which offers same-day delivery from tons of stores locally,
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.240]   like Walgreens, Target, Safeway, CVS,
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.540]   and Visa has a partnership to give you
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.320]   some amount of free time with Shipt.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.760]   If you have a regular Visa card,
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.260]   you just get one month free.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.060]   If you have a Visa signature card, you get three months free.
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.520]   But if you have a Visa infinite card,
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.360]   like the Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.680]   you actually get Shipt free through the end of 2024.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.280]   So we've used this a ton
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.020]   to get free same-day delivery from Target.
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.760]   So I've actually been really happy with this perk,
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.640]   but I didn't know about it
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.360]   till I did a little bit of research,
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.640]   but it's not well-promoted.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.320]   So definitely worth looking into.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.160]   A couple other perks.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.020]   So if you have a MasterCard World or World Elite card,
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.160]   you get $5 of Lyft credit.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.200]   It's a little tricky.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.000]   You have to take three rides in a month,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.200]   and then you get a credit that you can use on your next ride.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.640]   So if you're taking a lot of Lyfts
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.040]   and you have a MasterCard World or World Elite card,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:53.880]   it could be worth it.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.840]   But if you're a much more casual user,
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.800]   then it might not actually get you much.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.260]   Chase, on the other hand,
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.820]   separate from the tiering structure,
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.620]   has a perk with Lyft where, depending on your card,
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.540]   if it's a Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.540]   you'll get 10X points on Lyft,
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.180]   and you'll get Lyft Pink for two years for free.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.700]   And if you have a Chase Ink or Freedom card
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.260]   or a Chase Sapphire Preferred,
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.320]   you get 5X points on Lyft,
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.700]   but you don't get the Lyft Pink free membership.
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.940]   That Lyft Pink free membership
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.020]   actually is good for two years,
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.520]   as long as you activate it by the end of 2024.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.880]   There's also a perk with DoorDash.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.680]   So on DoorDash, if you have a World Elite card,
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.880]   you get three free months of Dash Pass,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.360]   which offers you savings on DoorDash orders.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.780]   And it looks like you also get $5 a month off
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.680]   using your World Elite card at checkout.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.800]   Chase also has a deal with DoorDash going on,
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.320]   which is separate from that,
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.080]   which if you have a Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.280]   you get Dash Pass membership through the end of 2024,
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.800]   plus you get $5 a month in DoorDash credits.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.320]   And those credits actually last three months each,
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.080]   and it'll go through the end of 2024.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.880]   So you can stack up three of them,
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.720]   use them for $15 off and repeat.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.760]   Your Chase Sapphire Preferred and most co-brand cards,
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.360]   like United, Marriott, Southwest,
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.720]   also will get you the Dash Pass membership for free,
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.080]   but no credits.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.120]   And then the Freedom Unlimited and Flex cards
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.700]   will get you three months off,
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.760]   and then 50% off after that,
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.720]   but not quite as good as the other cards.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.520]   All you have to do to use those is just add
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.120]   your payment method to DoorDash,
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.760]   and it automatically kicks in.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.460]   So those are some of the perks that you get
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.280]   as part of those kind of tiered systems.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.280]   A few other last perks that are related to credit cards.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.200]   One is a free credit score.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.600]   So while sites like Credit Karma
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.000]   offer you free credit scores,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.200]   they're almost never showing you your true FICO score.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.680]   And instead, they show you a score called the Vantage score.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.000]   And I'll put a link in the show notes to the differences.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.080]   And while those sound similar,
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.840]   many lenders are still using your FICO score
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.280]   for making banking decisions.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.960]   So I like to be able to know what that score is as well.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.280]   Amex, Bank of America, and Discover
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.200]   all give you access to your FICO score for free.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.480]   I'll put a link to all the providers that do.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.200]   Almost every card issuer these days
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.760]   gives you access to your credit score for free,
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.200]   but only those issuers and a few others
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.140]   actually give you your FICO score.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.400]   Next, I'm gonna talk about museums.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.080]   If you have a Bank of America credit card
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.920]   or even a debit card,
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.960]   they have a program called Museums on Us,
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.160]   and they've been doing it for 25 years.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.820]   You get free general admission
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.360]   during the first full weekend of every month
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.320]   to more than 200 institutions across the US.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.280]   So you can go to their website,
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.240]   I'll put it in the show notes,
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.400]   and you can see a list of all the museums
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.640]   you get access to.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.120]   The next weekend from this recording is May 6th and 7th.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.120]   So that's something that's really interesting.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.480]   And if you have a Capital One card
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.800]   and you wanna go to museums,
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.480]   one option is you can be part of the Cultivist Community,
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.680]   which is something that you get
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.840]   a six-month complimentary membership to
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.400]   as a Capital One cardholder.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.720]   And that gives you access for you and up to three guests
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.080]   to more than 100 museums around the world,
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.360]   including the Guggenheim, the MoMA in San Francisco,
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.320]   the Louvre in Paris.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.240]   It's normally $40 a month,
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.200]   but you can get a six-month free membership.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.840]   I'll put the link in the show notes.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.800]   Great option if you're traveling to somewhere
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.220]   where you're gonna be doing a lot of museums
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.640]   and you wanna get a good discount.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   So there are probably tons of other perks and benefits
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.860]   that I didn't include.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.360]   I tried to highlight the ones
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.000]   that I think are the most valuable,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.600]   the most likely to use, the most interesting.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.000]   If there are ones I missed, definitely send me a note.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.720]   I'd love to add to the database
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.480]   so the next time I talk about this or write about it,
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.640]   I can include them.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.000]   And finally, one perk that's included
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.720]   with many of these cards, if not all of them,
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.760]   is called emergency card replacement.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.460]   So if you need to get access to your card
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.220]   and it gets stolen or lost,
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.960]   they'll actually send it to you anywhere in the world.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.300]   Might not always be overnight,
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.600]   might be two or three days,
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.940]   depending on how far and remote you are,
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.260]   but you are able to get your card replaced
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.100]   almost anywhere in the world if you lose it.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.780]   So don't forget that you have that.
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.820]   On the back of your card,
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.460]   there's usually a number you can call,
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.660]   even call Collect if you don't have access
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:07.920]   to international dialing.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.540]   You can use services like Google Voice
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.980]   that make it really, really cheap
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.260]   or even free to call U.S. phone numbers.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.620]   So that's another option
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.060]   if you don't want to have to rely on calling Collect.
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.140]   Hopefully this was helpful.
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.620]   The idea was to give you a real deep rundown
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.340]   of all the types of benefits and perks
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.100]   you might get from your credit cards that you're not using.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.340]   If you have any great stories of using these
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.940]   and getting a great deal or even having problems with them,
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:31.820]   shoot them my way.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.180]   I'd love to make sure everyone is as informed as possible
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.960]   on everything that's happening.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:36.980]   I appreciate it.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.340]   And I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.420]   Thank you again for helping me get to a thousand reviews.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.780]   I'm guessing by the end of the week, I'll be there.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.820]   So I just really want to thank everyone
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.660]   for your support and your help there.
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.980]   It means the world to me.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.140]   Have a great week.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.100]   See you next week.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.700]   (electricity buzzing)
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.520]   (birds chirping)
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:11.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
