[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.340]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.260]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.180]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.140]   Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Duncan French
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.100]   as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.560]   Dr. French is the vice president of performance
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.680]   at the UFC Performance Institute,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.920]   and he has over 20 years of experience
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.280]   working with elite professional and Olympic athletes.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.600]   Prior to joining the UFC,
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.680]   French was the director of performance science
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.480]   at the University of Notre Dame,
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.840]   and he has many, many quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.880]   to his name, exploring, for instance,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.240]   how the particular order of exercise,
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.460]   whether or not one performs endurance exercise
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.320]   prior to resistance training or vice versa,
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.440]   how that impacts performance of various movements
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.320]   and endurance training protocols,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.180]   as well as the impact on hormones,
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.360]   such as testosterone, estrogen,
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.920]   and some of the stress hormones, such as cortisol.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.700]   He's also done fascinating work
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.960]   exploring how neurotransmitters,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.920]   things like dopamine and epinephrine,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.280]   also called adrenaline, can impact hormones,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.060]   and how hormones can impact neurotransmitter release.
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.720]   What's particularly unique about Dr. French's work
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.060]   is that he's figured out specific training protocols
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.240]   that can maximize, for instance, testosterone output
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.820]   or reduce stress hormone output
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.700]   in order to maximize the effects of training
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.640]   in the short term and in the long term.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.980]   So today you're going to learn a lot of protocols,
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.600]   whether or not you're into resistance training
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.840]   or endurance training,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.840]   you will learn, for instance,
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.160]   how to regulate the duration of your training
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.340]   and the type of training that you do
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.080]   in order to get the maximum benefit
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.180]   from that training over time.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.600]   So whether or not you are somebody
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.800]   who just exercises recreationally for your health,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.640]   whether or not you're an amateur or professional athlete,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.160]   or whether or not you're just trying to maximize your health
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.480]   through the use of endurance and/or resistance training,
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.840]   today's discussion will have a wealth of takeaways for you.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.120]   There are only a handful of people
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.460]   working at the intersection of elite performance,
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.760]   mechanistic science, and that can do so in a way
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.240]   that leads to direct, immediately applicable protocols
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.020]   that anybody can benefit from.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.460]   Dr. French also provides some incredibly important insights
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.020]   about the direction that sport and exercise
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.760]   are taking in the world today
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.200]   and their applications towards performance and health.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.180]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.680]   that this podcast is separate
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.960]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.120]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.160]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.380]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.880]   to the general public.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.000]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.900]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.800]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.940]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.160]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.460]   I've spent my career working on the visual system,
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.360]   and I can tell you that everything about the way
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.240]   that Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.240]   was with performance in mind.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.020]   First of all, they're extremely lightweight,
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.560]   so you actually forget that you're wearing them
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.480]   most of the time.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.980]   Second of all, even if you get sweaty,
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.860]   if you're running or biking or it's a hot day
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.160]   or running around just happened to be perspiring quite a lot,
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   they don't slip off your face, which is terrific.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.440]   They also have a great aesthetic
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.920]   and they have a lot of different styles to choose from.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.040]   The clarity of the lenses is superb.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.400]   I don't think there's a match for the clarity
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.600]   of Roca glasses out there,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.700]   and if there is, I'm not aware of it.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.680]   They are absolutely crystal clear,
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.120]   and that's true in any environment,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.800]   whether or not you're working in a dim environment
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.120]   or a bright environment, the clarity is unmatched.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.880]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.840]   you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.760]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.160]   your first order.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.320]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.360]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.040]   that are uniquely tailored to your sleep needs.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.640]   All of us have unique sleep needs
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.020]   and we should be sleeping on a mattress that's ideal for us.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.360]   If you go to the Helix site,
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.120]   they have a quick two minute quiz,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.720]   ask you a number of questions about whether or not
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.440]   you sleep on your side, your back, your stomach,
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.580]   do you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.120]   Maybe you don't have the answers to those questions,
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.080]   which is fine.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.360]   They'll match you to the mattress
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.720]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.440]   I took that quiz and about 10 months ago,
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.080]   I started sleeping on the Dusk Helix mattress,
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.380]   that's D-U-S-K.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.000]   That's the mattress that's ideal for me
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.600]   and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.380]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.140]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.600]   take their two minute sleep quiz,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.440]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.540]   and you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.800]   and two free pillows.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.580]   That's helixsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.340]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.840]   Headspace is a meditation app
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.540]   that's backed by 25 published studies.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.600]   By now, I think most people have heard about
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.280]   or experienced the benefits of meditation.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.160]   Improved focus, better sleep, reduced stress,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.800]   more creativity and insight.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.040]   There's just so many studies out there
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.780]   that support those claims.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.200]   The challenge, however, is sticking
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.640]   to a meditation practice.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.120]   And over the years, I confess there've been times
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.760]   when I've meditated regularly and then I stopped meditating,
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.680]   even though it always provides benefits for me
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.240]   the first time I do it and every time I do it.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.700]   With the Headspace app,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.960]   it makes it very easy to meditate consistently
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.200]   because they have different types of meditations
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.960]   to select from and they come in different duration.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.280]   So sometimes I only have three or four minutes to meditate.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.240]   They have those sorts of meditations.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   They also have longer meditations of 20 minutes or more.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.400]   If you want to try Headspace,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.480]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.120]   And if you do that, you'll get a free one month trial
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.460]   with Headspace's full library of meditations
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.780]   that you can use in any situation.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.000]   This is the best deal offered by Headspace right now.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.120]   So again, if you're interested,
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.400]   go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.900]   And now my conversation with Dr. Duncan French.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.960]   Duncan French, great to see you again.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.680]   - Flightwise, flightwise, thank you.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.200]   I don't often have many Stanford professors
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.840]   in the Performance Institute, so I'm really excited.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.240]   - Oh, well, this place is amazing
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.760]   and you have a huge role in making it what it is.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.920]   The reason I'm so excited to talk with you
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.640]   is that you're one of these rare beasts
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.820]   that you have been involved in human performance
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.820]   and athletic performance at the collegiate level.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.900]   You are obviously very involved in MMA now
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.820]   and the UFC Performance Institute.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.820]   And you also had the fortunate experience,
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.000]   I like to think, of doing a PhD in,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.820]   what exactly was the PhD in?
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.700]   - It was exercise physiology. - Exercise physiology.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.440]   So you're familiar also with designing studies,
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.260]   control groups, all the sorts of things that,
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.220]   in my opinion anyway, are kind of lacking
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.220]   from the internet social media version of exercise science,
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.660]   which is that people throw out all sorts of ideas
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.960]   about how people should be training,
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.520]   what they should be doing and eating
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.200]   and not eating and doing.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.640]   And certainly science doesn't have all the answers,
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.740]   but I just think it's so rare to find somebody
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.920]   that's at the convergence of all those different fields.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.880]   And so I have a lot of questions for you today
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.280]   that I'm sure the audience
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.680]   are going to be really interested in it.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.440]   - Well, listen, I mean, I appreciate that.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.280]   It's very humbling.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.280]   And yeah, I've worked hard to get to where I am,
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.920]   but I've always tried to be authentic.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   And I think authenticity comes alongside academic rigor
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.040]   and objectivity and insight and knowledge base, right?
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.840]   At the end of the day, it's about having confidence,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.560]   having expertise and being able to deliver that expertise
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.560]   to, in my world, to athletes.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.720]   And I think that's what I've always tried to do.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.780]   I've tried to have many strings to my bow
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.600]   so that I can talk with many different hats on.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.960]   But one day I'm talking to a coach,
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.160]   the next day I'm talking to an athlete,
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.780]   the next day I'm talking to a CEO,
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.360]   the next day I'm talking to an academic professor.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.520]   So I think being able to wear those different hats
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.400]   is certainly a skillset that I've tried to build
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.240]   throughout my career.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.840]   And like I said, I've been blessed to work with,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.020]   I think it was 36 different professional or Olympic sports
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.720]   last time I counted.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.880]   So yeah, it's been a wild ride.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.720]   It's been great.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.600]   - Which of those sports was the most unusual?
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.560]   - I've worked with crown green bowling,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.060]   which I don't know as an American guy,
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.240]   I don't know how well you know that.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.240]   Basically imagine a 20 foot by 20 foot square of turf
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.640]   with a small raise in the middle, i.e. the crown.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.160]   So it slopes to the edges.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.360]   And then you throw out a white jack, a smaller ball,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.920]   and then you roll out larger balls
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.000]   to try and get closest to the jack.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.560]   It's a very European thing, let's say.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.600]   But yeah, sports performance at crown green bowling.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.440]   There you go.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.720]   - All right.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.280]   Wow, and then to a mixed martial arts fighter,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.760]   and everything in between.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.520]   So along those lines,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.600]   could you give us a little bit of your background?
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.480]   Where'd you start out?
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.040]   Where are you from originally?
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.280]   - Yeah, I'm from the Northeast of England.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.160]   So I'm from a town called Harrogate, which is in Yorkshire,
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.400]   which is a Northern kind of area of the UK.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.720]   - Nice sunny weather all year long.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.440]   - Yeah, you can imagine, yeah,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.680]   with the two weeks of summer that we get, you know?
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.360]   But yeah, I mean, I did my undergraduate studies there
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.400]   in sports science.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.800]   I did teacher training
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.400]   to be a physical education teacher after that.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.120]   Like most people, I then worked as a high school
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.680]   physical education teacher.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   You know, great experience working with kids,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.120]   developing athletic qualities,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.560]   but something in the back of my mind always,
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.960]   I wanted more, I wanted to be at the higher end
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.920]   of elite sport.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.560]   You know, I was a failed athlete like many people.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.160]   I represented my country in different sports and things,
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.960]   but I never made it professionally.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.240]   So, you know, that little seed was sown in as much
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.640]   as I then started to reach out to, you know,
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.800]   to different areas to do a PhD,
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.920]   whether it was in the UK or also, you know,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.160]   chance my arm took a punt,
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.800]   see if we could get over to the States.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.520]   All my buddies were going on, you know,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.240]   gap years after they finished university or whatever,
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.000]   and going to Bali and hanging out or whatever,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.040]   traveling through Thailand.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.520]   And I figured, well, you know,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.360]   I've always loved the States and can I go
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.640]   and kill two birds with one stone
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.280]   and do something academic, continue my studies,
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.800]   but also do it in a different environment
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.600]   and get some life experience.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.120]   And then many, many rejections,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.400]   as I'm sure you're kind of aware from different professors,
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   whether it was Roger Naranoka or, you know,
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.240]   William Cramer or whatever.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.200]   - So you just wrote to these folks?
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.360]   - I just cold called and sent out information
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.600]   and said, yeah, so have you got any opportunities?
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.240]   Pushed back from them all, but you know,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.200]   dogged and kept asking.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.280]   And yeah, Dr. William Cramer,
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.520]   who was at Ball State University in Indiana at the time,
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.040]   you know, a muscle neuroendocrinologist
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.000]   and researcher in muscle physiology
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.360]   using resistance training.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.600]   You know, he basically said, listen,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.720]   I can guarantee your funding
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.960]   for the first year of your studies, but not the next three.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.200]   - Sounds like a typical academic response.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.280]   I can take care of you, but not that well necessarily.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.560]   - Yeah, so spoke to my parents and said,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.480]   hey, can we take a punt?
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.280]   And they, you know, they were great in supporting me.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.640]   And yeah, long story short,
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.960]   came out to begin my PhD at Ball State.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.640]   After a year, Dr. Cramer transferred to Yukon,
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.440]   you know, Connecticut in stores in the Northeast there.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.280]   And I transferred with him.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.200]   And yeah, four great years with my PhD
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.920]   and getting my PhD with a really prolific research group
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.280]   that looked at, you know, neuroendocrinology,
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.560]   hormonal work, but using a resistance training
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.280]   primarily as an exercise stressor as a major mechanism.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.120]   And then looking at all the different physiologies
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.720]   off the back of resistance training.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.700]   - Yeah, you guys were enormously productive.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.960]   I found dozens of papers
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.960]   on how weight training impacts hormones
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.160]   and your name is on all of them.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.840]   And it's remarkable.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.200]   I have a question about this.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.320]   I'll just inject a question
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.580]   about weight training and hormones.
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.420]   You hear this all the time that doing these big,
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.760]   heavy compound movements or resistance training
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.420]   increases androgens, things like testosterone,
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.360]   DHT, DHEA, and so forth.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.740]   Does anyone know how that actually happens?
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.180]   Like what about move, what about in,
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.120]   what is it about engaging motor neurons under heavy loads
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.700]   sends a signal to the endocrine system,
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.640]   hey, release testosterone.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.920]   I've never actually been able to find that in a textbook.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.220]   - Yeah, well, I mean.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.520]   - And how can I do more of that?
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.420]   - Yeah, as much as I know, and again,
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.560]   I'm digging out into the annals
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.400]   of Duncan French's kind of brain now.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.960]   But yeah, I mean, I think it's a stress response, right?
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.140]   It's mechanical stress and it's metabolic stress.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.560]   And these are, the downstream regulation
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.360]   of testosterone release at the gonads
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.320]   comes from many different areas.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.900]   My work primarily looked at catecholamines
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.080]   and sympathetic arousal.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.620]   - So things like epinephrine, adrenalin.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.240]   - Correct, yeah, epinephrine, adrenalin, noradrenalin,
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.060]   how they were signaling,
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.140]   the signaling cascade using the HPA axis,
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.620]   releasing cortisol, and then looking at how that also
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.940]   influenced the adrenal medulla to release androgens,
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.980]   and then signaling that at the gonads.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.380]   - That raises an interesting question.
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.940]   So in presumably weight training in women,
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.340]   people who don't have testes, also it increases testosterone.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.020]   Is that purely through the adrenals?
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.020]   When women lift weights,
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.740]   their adrenal glands release testosterone?
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.860]   - Absolutely, I mean, that is the only area
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.400]   of testosterone release for females.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.560]   And yes, it's the same downstream cascade.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.340]   Obviously the extent to which it happens
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.260]   is significantly less in females,
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.580]   but that's how you, there's good data out there
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.300]   that shows females can increase their anabolic environment,
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.460]   their internal anabolic milieu
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.460]   using resistance training as a stressor.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.840]   And then they get the consequent muscle tissue growth,
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.720]   whether it's tendon ligament adaptations,
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.320]   the beneficial consequences of resistance training,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.820]   which is driven by anabolic stimuli.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.300]   - Yeah, I have two questions about that.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.780]   The first one is something that you mentioned,
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.540]   which is that the androgens,
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.300]   the testosterone comes from the adrenals
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.360]   under resistance loads in women.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.040]   Is the same true in men?
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.340]   I mean, we hear that the testes produce testosterone
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.300]   when we weight train for men that have testes,
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.720]   but do we know whether or not it's the adrenals
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.160]   or the testes in men that are increasing testosterone?
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.060]   More or both, a little bit from each?
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.940]   - The field is divided presently
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.940]   and as much as understanding the acute adrenergic response
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:28.900]   in terms of anabolic response to exercise in an acute phase
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.100]   and the exposure to a stimulus that is stress driven,
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.380]   which might be partly from the adrenal glands,
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.620]   partly from the gonads,
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.480]   versus a longitudinal exposure to anabolic environments,
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.880]   which is primarily driven by obviously the gonads
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.340]   and the release of the endocrine environment
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.780]   from testosterone release at the gonads.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.820]   So the field is split in terms of how exercise
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.700]   is promoting hypertrophy, muscle tissue growth,
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.240]   and whether that is very much an adrenal stimuli
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.920]   or if that's significant enough in these acute responses
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   versus the longitudinal exposure,
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.420]   just elevated basal levels of anabolic testosterone
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.700]   at a habitual level.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.480]   - So it sounds like with most things, it's probably both.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.640]   It's probably the adrenals and the gonads.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.820]   And then you mentioned that testosterone
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.960]   can have enhancing effects or growth effects
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.700]   on tendon and ligament also.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.160]   You don't often hear about that.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.820]   People always think testosterone muscle,
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.000]   but testosterone has a lot of effects on other tissues
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.920]   that are important for performance, it sounds like.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.760]   - Yeah.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.120]   - Especially in there. - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.000]   I mean, I think the testosterone hormone is,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.600]   I mean, listen, there's androgen receptors
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.800]   on neural tissue, on neural axons.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.780]   - Pretty much everywhere.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.100]   - Exactly, so the binding capacity of testosterone
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.640]   and influence in different tissues within the body
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.480]   are touched on muscle tissue,
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.180]   but the ligaments, the tendons, even bone to some extent,
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.440]   testosterone is potential to influence that
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.360]   in terms of removing osteopenic kind of characteristics,
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.200]   et cetera.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   So yeah, it's a magic hormone, let's say,
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.560]   with many, many end impacts in terms of adaptation.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.160]   - I definitely want to get back to your trajectory,
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.440]   but as long as we're on the interactions
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.580]   between androgens, testosterone and its derivatives,
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.400]   and different tissues,
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.000]   you know, from the work that you did as a PhD student
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.440]   and throughout your career,
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.720]   could you say that there are some general principles
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.500]   of training that favor testosterone production
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.760]   in terms of, that somebody who's not an elite athlete
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.920]   could use, somebody who's already adapted
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.940]   to weight training somewhat,
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.580]   like they know the difference between a dumbbell
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.780]   and a barbell, and they know the various movements,
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.000]   they're not going to damage themselves,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.940]   but once they're doing that, I mean,
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.900]   I've heard shorter sessions are better than longer sessions,
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.040]   but in rep loads, now there's a lot of parameter space,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.800]   but if you were going to throw out some of the parameters
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.400]   that you think are most important to pay attention to
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.240]   for the typical person who's trying to use weight training
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.080]   to build or maintain muscle, lose body fat,
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.740]   so body recomposition, and/or stay strong and healthy
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.560]   for sport of a different kind.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.280]   - Yeah, so the work that we obviously,
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.480]   you know, I was exposed to back in my PhD,
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.800]   it was a double-edged sword,
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.100]   and as much as testosterone is really stimulated
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.400]   by an intensity factor and also a volume factor.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.080]   Now, growth hormone is a little bit different.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.580]   That's largely driven by an intensity factor alone.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.420]   - Oh, really?
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.540]   - I just saw that growth hormone was driven by volume,
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.700]   which just goes to show you, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.540]   I think you're probably right.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.520]   It just goes to show you that most of what's out there
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.380]   on the internet is completely, not only is it wrong,
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.260]   it's usually backwards, so no, trust.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.580]   No, trust your instinct because I think people
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.940]   just make this stuff up, right?
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.940]   Because it's very hard to measure growth hormone
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:54.300]   and testosterone, and I can't imagine most of the stuff
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.960]   that I see out there, they're taking drips
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.920]   and, you know, measuring free versus bound
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.760]   and all this kind of stuff,
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.140]   but that's what you do in laboratories.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:01.980]   - Right, yeah.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.140]   You look at total composition and you look at how much
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.900]   of that is free circulating in the system,
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.020]   how much is bound and therefore biologically active,
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.960]   bound to receptor creating an adaptation.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.020]   But yeah, coming back to testosterone in terms
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.560]   of the training strategies, it's largely driven
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.200]   by both an intensity and a volume factor.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.600]   So if you look at many of the exercise interventions
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.240]   that we use to try and investigate
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.280]   and interrogate testosterone, it was usually,
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.540]   you know, a six by 10 protocol.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.880]   So you're touching-
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.040]   - Six by 10 meaning?
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.440]   - Yeah, six sets of 10 repetitions,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.340]   which is quite a large, you know, 60 repetitions
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.420]   is quite a large volume for a single exercise.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.940]   And that was usually pitched at about 80% intense
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.900]   of a one repetition max intensity.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.460]   - Okay, so 80% of the one rep max,
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.620]   six sets of 10 reps separated by rest of like-
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.460]   - Two minutes.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.260]   - Two minutes, which is actually pretty fast,
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.260]   at least to me.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.660]   Anytime you see these two to three minutes,
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.420]   when you're actually watching the clock,
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.540]   those two minute rest periods go by pretty fast.
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.140]   - By the third, fourth set, you're dying for more.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.820]   And I think, you know, we formulated
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.460]   that kind of exercise protocol to really target,
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.300]   you know, the release of testosterone
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.420]   and try and drive up these anabolic environments
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.380]   to study the endocrine, you know, consequences.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.260]   But I think that's the type of protocol
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:24.460]   that is most advantageous for driving anabolic environment.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.260]   - And that was it for the workout?
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.180]   - Yeah, I mean, we would do that in a back squat.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.820]   So, you know, multi-joint, you know,
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.020]   challenging exercise, multi-muscle, multi-joint,
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.080]   80% loads of your one repetition max, and then six by 10.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.300]   We did play around with, you know,
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.300]   your classic German volume type 10 by 10 kind of protocols,
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.700]   but they were just unsustainable at that 80%.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.180]   The key to what we also did was we always adjusted
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.580]   the loads to make sure that it was 10 repetitions
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.700]   that were sustained.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.140]   So if the load was too high and an athlete or participant
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.300]   had to drop the weights on the sixth repetition,
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.780]   we would unload the bar and make sure
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.660]   they completed the 10 repetitions.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.940]   Bringing me back to the point of it's an intensity
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.820]   and a volume derivative that is going to be
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.900]   most advantageous for testosterone release.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.860]   - That's really interesting.
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.620]   And one thing that you mentioned there is,
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.300]   especially interesting to me, which is you said,
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.580]   when you go from six sets of 10 repetitions
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.580]   to 10 sets of 10 repetitions,
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.520]   it's not as beneficial and might even be counterproductive.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.080]   But to me, the difference between six and 10 sets
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.980]   is only four sets.
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.260]   It doesn't even sound that much.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.220]   So that sort of hints at the possibility
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.520]   that the thresholds for going from a workout
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.480]   that increases testosterone to a workout
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.280]   that diminishes testosterone
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.020]   is actually a pretty narrow margin.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.500]   - Yeah, and I think it comes back
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.900]   to that intensity factor then.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.060]   You know, what we saw with that 10 by 10 protocol
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.100]   really sees pretty significant drop-offs in the load.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.340]   And again, we're trying to stimulate with intensity,
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.940]   with mechanical strain through intensity,
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.180]   as well as metabolic strain through volume.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.760]   And I think that's the paradigm that you've got to look at
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.940]   is that the mechanical load has to come
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.160]   from the actual weight on the bar
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.220]   and the volume is the metabolic stimulus.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.660]   How much are we driving lactate?
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.180]   How much are we driving glycogenolysis
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.340]   in terms of that type of energy system
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.480]   for executing a 10 by 10 protocol?
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.060]   And what we often saw was just a significant reduction
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.360]   in the intensity capabilities of an athlete to sustain that.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.840]   So we shortened the volume
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.040]   to try and maintain the intensity.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:32.880]   - Interesting.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.260]   And you could imagine just taking very long rest,
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.380]   keeping the session, being a big lazy bear in training.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.220]   I sometimes do this.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.140]   I tell myself I'm going to work out for 45 minutes
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.660]   and then two hours later I'm done.
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.260]   But not because I was huffing and puffing the whole time,
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.140]   but because I was training really slowly.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.440]   Is there any evidence that training slowly
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.280]   can offset some of the negative effects
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.580]   of doing a lot of volume?
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.400]   - Well, it's an old adage of two responses to your question.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.900]   I mean, the first one I would say,
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.820]   there's a difference between 10 sets of six
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.160]   and six sets of 10.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.860]   And I think that comes back to the volume conversation.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.260]   Six sets of 10 is driving up metabolic stimulus.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.980]   If you're doing 10 sets of six,
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.580]   you can probably take it to a higher intensity,
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.820]   but you're not going to get the same metabolic load.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.340]   You're not going to get the same internal metabolic
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.340]   environment that drives the lactate release
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.180]   that they will then signal further anabolic
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.060]   testosterone release because of the lactate in your body.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.560]   That's a key consideration.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.180]   The rest is often the consideration that's overlooked
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.700]   out there in general population
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.300]   and in many sporting environments.
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.580]   The rest is as important a programming variable
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.420]   as the load and the intensity of the load,
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.860]   the volume, et cetera.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.660]   And yes, if you extend the volume,
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.780]   if you extend the duration of your rest periods,
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.940]   what you're ultimately doing is influencing
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.540]   that metabolic stimulus again.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.260]   You're allowing the flushing of the body,
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.140]   the removal of waste products,
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.500]   lactate to be removed from the body,
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.060]   and then the metabolic environment is reduced.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.260]   - So you want, so if I understand correctly,
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.420]   you want to create a metabolic stress.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.260]   - Absolutely.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.380]   - So the way that I've been training slow and lazy
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.820]   is not necessarily the best way to go.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.700]   I could, in theory, do a 45 or 60 minute session
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.820]   where I pack in more work per unit time.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.440]   I'm not going to be able to quote unquote perform as well.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.240]   I won't be able to lift as much.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.980]   I'm going to have to unweight the bar between sets
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.660]   or maybe even during sets if I have someone
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.860]   who could do that.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.940]   But it sounds like that's the way to go.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.540]   So it's got to be, so this,
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.980]   the old adage of high intensity short duration
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.100]   is probably the way to go.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:42.940]   - Correct.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.900]   And you know, in layman's terms, if the same objective,
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.420]   the same training goal is just muscle tissue growth,
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.480]   and we're not talking about maximal strength
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.860]   or any of those type of parameters.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.780]   We're just talking about growing muscle.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.780]   If there's an athlete A and they do six sets of 10
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.720]   with two minutes rest, and there's athlete B
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.300]   that does six sets of 10 with three minutes rest,
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.400]   athlete A will likely see the highest muscle gain,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   muscle hypertrophy gains because of the metabolic stimulus
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.420]   that they're driving with the shorter rest periods.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.260]   - Interesting.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.680]   For all the years that I've spent exploring exercise science
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.060]   and trying to get this information from the internet
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.780]   and various places that this is the first time
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.140]   it's ever been told to me clearly.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.880]   So basically I need to put my ego aside
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.940]   and I need to not focus so much on getting as many reps
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.740]   with a given weight and keep the rest restricted
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.340]   to about two minutes, get the work in,
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.540]   and then I'll derive the benefits.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.260]   - I mean, you've absolutely nailed it to be honest.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.100]   And again, if you think about human nature
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.460]   and how we approached, we're inherently lazy, right?
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.460]   As humans, we want to take that rest.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.820]   We want to take the time out to recover and feel refreshed,
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.560]   but we're trying to create a training stimulus.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.540]   We're trying to create a very specific stimulus
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.820]   internal to the body.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.780]   And that is often driven by the metabolic environment
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.900]   at that moment in time.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.620]   Now, if we allow the metabolic environment to change
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.740]   by extending the rest periods,
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.620]   we're not going to see as beneficial gains at the end of it.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.460]   - Very interesting.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.980]   It is very much a motivational and ego thing
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.180]   rather than saying, okay, I'm going to push my loads
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.780]   as high as I can and really challenge maximal strength,
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.340]   do fewer repetitions, take longer periods of time.
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.580]   It's a completely different approach to training.
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.820]   It's a different end goal.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.660]   - Interesting.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.480]   And you mentioned lactate.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.300]   So it seems still a bit controversial
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.100]   as to what actually triggers hypertrophy.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.100]   You hear about lactate buildup or people that,
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.100]   the common language is the muscle gets torn
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.340]   and then repairs, but I don't know,
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.020]   does the muscle actually tear?
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.980]   - I mean, microtrauma.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.900]   - Okay, microtrauma.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.100]   - Disruption of the mic within the muscle tissue.
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:45.940]   - Interesting.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.720]   And we're talking now about non-drug assisted,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.100]   people who's, let's just say, let's define our terms here,
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.560]   that whose testosterone levels are within the range
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.860]   of somewhere between 300 and 1,500 or whatever, 1,200,
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:04.940]   because it does seem that athletes who take high levels
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.920]   of exogenous androgens can do more work
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.220]   and just get protein synthesis from just doing work.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.240]   I've seen these guys in the gym, right?
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.540]   The hotel signs are not that hard to spot
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.000]   where they're just doing a ton of volume,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.640]   not necessarily moving that much weight.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.000]   They're just bringing blood into the tissue.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.480]   And then they're loading up on,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.620]   they're eating a ton of protein,
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.580]   presumably 'cause they're basically in puberty part 15.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.420]   - Right.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.040]   - They got in their 15th round of puberty
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.520]   where during puberty, you are a protein synthesis machine.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.160]   I mean, to me, that's pretty clear about puberty.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.000]   Interesting.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.800]   So, and then in terms of,
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.820]   because I know the audience likes to try protocol,
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.780]   so you described a protocol very nicely.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.500]   What about day-to-day recovery?
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.380]   I mean, the workout that you described is intense but short.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.440]   How many days a week can the typical person do that
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.260]   and sustain progress?
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.460]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that comes back to your training age
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.320]   and your training history.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.500]   Obviously, there's a resilience and a robustness
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.680]   with an incremental training age.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.900]   So, that's not a protocol that I would advise anyone
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.120]   to go out and start tomorrow.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.160]   - They'll be mopping them off the gym floor.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.240]   - But at the same time, it's also relative, right?
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.280]   So 80%, it'd be a maximum at a young training age,
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.280]   it's still 80% versus, I've been training 10 years,
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.240]   it's still 80%.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.280]   But yes, the mechanical load is gonna be significant.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.820]   It's just more tonnage, right?
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.720]   But yeah, I think a protocol like that,
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.960]   we would look at two times a week,
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.160]   something that's pretty intensive like that,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.020]   because again, it comes back to the point you make,
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.320]   is that you really need to be, for want of better terms,
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.980]   suffering a little bit through that type of protocol,
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.640]   both in terms of the challenge of the load,
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.960]   but also being able to tolerate the metabolic stress
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.920]   that you're exposed to.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.800]   It's a bit of a sicko feeling, right?
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.540]   Because of the lactate that you're driving up.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.880]   So, I wouldn't promote an athlete doing that type
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.680]   of modality multiple, multiple times,
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.440]   unless you're from the realms of bodybuilding,
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.660]   and then you really, that's the sole purpose
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.860]   of what you're trying to achieve.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:13.860]   Most athletes in most sports have diverse requirements
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.060]   in terms of outcomes that they're trying to achieve.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.640]   They're not just targeting muscle growth.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.200]   Muscle growth is a conduit to increase strength,
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.960]   increase power, increase speed, obviously.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.440]   So yes, trying to get bigger cross-sectional area
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.500]   of a muscle means that we can produce more force
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.560]   into the ground or wherever it may be,
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.160]   for a locomotive athlete.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.400]   But usually sports men and women
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.340]   are not just purely seeking muscle growth.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.020]   They look for different facets of muscle endurance
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.080]   or maximal muscle power, muscle strength.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.800]   So then you've got to be very creative
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.240]   in how you build the workout.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.880]   If it's a bodybuilder, absolutely.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.200]   They're chasing muscle growth,
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.480]   and they're going to do so with these types of protocols,
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.600]   which sees high intensities and high volumes of workload
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.520]   on a pretty regular basis.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.960]   If it's just somebody, a weekend warrior
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.880]   that wants to keep in shape and look good,
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.840]   I would say two times a week
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.640]   for a really challenging workout like that,
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.800]   and then flex the other types of workouts within the week
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.840]   to have more of a volume emphasis,
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.240]   where you reduce the intensity
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.840]   and you might just look at larger rep ranges
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.720]   from 12 to 15 to 20.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.860]   Another workout where you're looking at reducing the volume,
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.240]   but increasing the intensity
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.380]   and really trying to drive a different stimulus
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.140]   to give you more end points of success.
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.100]   - Great, no, that's really informative.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.340]   Along the lines of androgens and intensity,
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.340]   when I think intensity, I think epinephrine, adrenaline.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.400]   And since you have a background
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.900]   in catecholamines and testosterone,
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.560]   last time I was here at the USC Performance Institute,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.800]   we had a brief conversation,
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.100]   and I want to make sure I got the details right,
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.060]   that in the short term,
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.620]   and a big increase in stress hormone
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.640]   can lead to an increase in testosterone,
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.480]   like a parachute jump.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.400]   But so stress can promote the release of testosterone.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.880]   That was news to me.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.280]   We always hear about stress suppressing testosterone,
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.720]   stress suppressing the immune system,
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.760]   all these terrible things,
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.440]   but in the short term,
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.240]   you're saying it can actually increase
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.780]   the release of testosterone.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.000]   So I have that right?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.160]   - Correct. - Okay.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.680]   And so then the second question is,
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:29.280]   does my cognitive interpretation of the stressor
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.120]   make a difference?
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.100]   In other words,
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.140]   if I voluntarily jump out of a plane with a parachute,
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.520]   does it have a different effect on my testosterone
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.120]   than if you shove me out of the plane against my will?
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.580]   Or presumably with a parachute, too.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.640]   - I mean, so this was what all my PhD work was looking at,
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.640]   was the exposure to a stressor
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.320]   and the pre-arousal
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.560]   of how your body essentially prepares for that stressor
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.760]   and then how it manages it
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.480]   throughout the exposure to the stress.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.680]   And it was actually motivated from parachute jumpers.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.380]   There was an older study
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.680]   looking at parachute jumpers into combat.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.600]   And then they were studying the cortisol,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.720]   the stress response and the epinephrine response
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.840]   of these parachute jumpers.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.800]   So we got us thinking about,
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.820]   hold on, there's certain workouts that you do
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.520]   that are just the daunting.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.240]   It's like, okay, it's squat Saturday or whatever it may be.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.480]   Oh my gosh, this is gonna destroy me.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.800]   - Or I have to talk to this person
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.160]   I don't want to talk to, right?
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.960]   I mean, or a PhD dissertation exam or something.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.720]   - Giving public speaking or whatever it may be.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.180]   Now, we used a resistance training protocol
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.280]   that these athletes knew
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.120]   was going to be very, very challenging.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.360]   It's gonna be that it's gonna have some anxiety to doing it
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.480]   then knew there were gonna be some physical distress
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.520]   from doing it.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.320]   And therefore, their mindset
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.720]   of how they were gonna approach that was already set.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.400]   So what we saw prior,
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.080]   15 minutes prior to the start of an exposure to the workout,
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.000]   the epinephrine, the neuro adrenaline,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.400]   the adrenaline was already starting
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.060]   to prepare the body sympathetically
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.980]   to go into what it knew was going to be
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.040]   a very, very challenging workout.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.520]   So that brings you back to exercise preparation,
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.960]   competition for certain preparation,
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.040]   preparation for certain competition, excuse me,
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.200]   pre-workout routines, the use of music,
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.880]   all these different things that we know can now,
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.160]   anecdotally in the gym we put into place,
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.220]   but the data that I presented showed that
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.480]   it was the first of its kind to show that this link
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.560]   between epinephrine and norepinephrine release
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.100]   and arousal and then consequent performance.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.900]   So force output throughout the workout
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.940]   was intimately linked.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.260]   - So what was the takeaway there?
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.600]   Is it beneficial for people to get a little stressed
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.820]   about the upcoming impending event,
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.840]   whether or not it's a lift in the gym
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.980]   or whether or not it's talking to somebody
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:04.560]   that you might be intimidated to talk to or an exam?
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.820]   Is the stress good for performance or is it harmful?
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.840]   - Yeah, and I think that's a great question.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.240]   And I think I can only talk to physical exertion,
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.620]   which is what we were exploring.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.660]   And I don't want to tread on the toes of the psychologists
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.400]   with flow state and these types of things,
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.240]   because clearly-
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.000]   - I think you're in the position of scientific strength
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.680]   on this one, I think you have the leverage.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.640]   I mean, I have a lot of friends in that community,
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.320]   as I'll just say, as a buffer
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.360]   to the answer you're about to give,
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.920]   that there's very little science around flow
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.380]   and there's very little neuroscience
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.460]   related to most psychological states anyway.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.480]   So I think we've got a lot of degrees of freedom here.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.680]   - All right, I can breathe easy, thank you for that.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.920]   - I'll be anything you like, credit Duncan,
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.120]   anything you dislike, send the mean comments to me.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.000]   - Yeah, I think from my data,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.180]   certainly the greater the arousal,
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.680]   the higher the performance was
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.080]   from a physical exertion perspective.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.960]   And I think that was the intriguing part
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.920]   of some of my findings,
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.840]   where there's definitely an individual biokinetics
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.840]   to some of these hormonal kind of releases.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.960]   And as much as those guys that had the highest
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.360]   adrenergic response in terms of epinephrine release,
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.320]   norepinephrine release, also sustained force output
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.540]   for a longer period of the workout than those that didn't.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.960]   So the individuals that had a lower stimulus
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.380]   of the sympathetic arousal, let's say,
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.820]   certainly didn't perform as well throughout the workout.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.820]   Now, the intriguing thing then becomes is, okay,
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:40.160]   and I think this really segues into what we're doing here
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.100]   with combat athletes, with mixed martial artists.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.380]   You know, there's a philosophy, there's a paradigm now
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.600]   for myself in terms of the exposure, repeat exposure.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.760]   The more you do that challenging workout,
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.980]   do you get the same psychological stimulus?
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.060]   Do you still get the same stress response?
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.620]   And the assumption is unlikely.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.700]   You know, you accommodate, you become accustomed
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.200]   to the stressor, your body will therefore adapt.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.700]   And that's the classic overload principle, right?
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.240]   You then need to take the stressor down a different route.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.960]   But I think when you look at the athletes
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.020]   that we work with here, it's a fist fight
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.060]   at the end of the day.
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.660]   There's nothing more stressful than that.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.940]   But I think just the exposure to the rigors of training,
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.720]   to understand the bad positions, the bad situations,
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.100]   to know that they can get out of certain situations,
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.040]   out of certain submission holds or whatever it may be,
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.180]   I think that really ties in with some of my PhD work
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.620]   in terms of what these guys do to approach
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.700]   what is a really challenging sport
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.060]   and arena in mixed martial arts.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.460]   - Yeah, it's definitely the extreme of what's possible
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:48.020]   in terms of asking does stress favor or hinder performance?
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.920]   Because yeah, like you said, at the end of the day,
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.900]   it's someone trying to hurt you as much as they possibly can
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:55.040]   within the bounds of the rules
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.540]   and you're trying to do the same.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:00.580]   So that's, I find that your thesis work fascinating.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.540]   Where you never to be at the UFC Performance Institute,
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.680]   luckily they made the right choice and brought you here.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.460]   But where you have never to come here,
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:13.260]   I was still fascinated by this because over and over,
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.500]   we hear that stress is bad, stress is bad, stress is bad.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.820]   But everything I read from the scientific literature
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:22.760]   is that stress and epinephrine in particular
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.860]   is coupled to the testosterone response
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.100]   to performance and to adaptation,
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.900]   provided it doesn't go on too long.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.100]   So unless I'm saying something that violates that,
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.420]   I mean, that's your work.
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.380]   So it's a really important and beautiful work
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.000]   and I refer to it often.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.660]   So I'm just glad that we could bolt that down
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.340]   because I think the people need to know this,
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.380]   that that discomfort is beneficial.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.900]   Now there's another side to this that I want to ask about,
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.580]   which is the use of cold in particular,
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.540]   things like ice baths, cold showers,
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:03.540]   or any other type of cold temperature exposure.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:08.580]   In theory, that's stress also, it's epinephrine.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.660]   And so how should one think about
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.340]   the use of cold for recovery?
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.720]   So if it's stress, if cold causes stress,
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.820]   then how is cold used for recovery?
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.140]   That's what I don't understand.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.940]   And maybe you just want to share your thoughts on that.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.980]   - Yeah, no, and I think it's a great question.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.220]   And I think the jury is still out there, certainly,
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.420]   knowing some of the conversations that we've been having.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.220]   But I think when we talk about stress,
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:40.180]   it's your classic fight, flight, or freeze approach.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.700]   And throwing your body into a cold tub,
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.140]   an ice bath or whatever it may be,
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.360]   certainly is going to have a physiological stress response.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.980]   Now, people are using that for different end goals.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.820]   And again, I think that's where the narrative
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.820]   has to be explained.
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.260]   If you are using that stress specifically
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.020]   to manage the mindset,
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.820]   to use it as a specific stress stimulus,
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.100]   that's the same as me doing six by 10, 80%.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.200]   You're just trying to find something to disrupt the system
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.620]   to do something that's very, if you want a better term,
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.620]   painful, discomfort, whatever.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.100]   You're just finding a stressor
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.380]   and then being able to manage the mindset.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.500]   But if you're using cold,
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.980]   specifically from a physiological perspective,
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.980]   to promote redistribution of vascular,
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.140]   of blood's flow to different vascular areas of muscle
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.820]   that you feel have gone through a workout,
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.620]   that are damaged or whatever it may be,
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.740]   I think we've got to understand
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.460]   what that stress mechanism is.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.940]   And the data, the literature is certainly still out there
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.000]   with respect to cryotherapy and cold baths
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.220]   and some of these high, these cold exposures
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.300]   in terms of what they do at the level of the muscle tissue.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.820]   If that's the target,
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.060]   if you're trying to promote a flushing mechanism
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.420]   or you're trying to promote redistribution of the blood flow,
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.060]   what you've got to understand is that cold
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.420]   is going to clamp down every part of the vascular system.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.500]   And we've really got to understand
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.980]   how the muscle would be redistributed
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.220]   to areas of interest.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:22.120]   So, I think the stress response is a real thing
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.300]   with respect to cold exposure.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.280]   But I think the narrative around
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.840]   what are you using the cold for
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.880]   has to precede the conversation.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.680]   Because yes, it's like putting your hand over a hot cold.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.900]   That's a stress the same way as jumping in a cold bath is.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.340]   - No, I think most people don't realize that.
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.760]   You're going to get the epinephrine release
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.360]   from holding your hand too close to the flame
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.040]   and you're going to get it from getting in the ice bath.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.800]   - Your body doesn't know the difference, right?
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.440]   Your body does not know the difference.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:55.440]   It has a primordial kind of physiological response
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.800]   that it's created over millions and millions of years.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.000]   And I think that physiology is not changing
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.440]   and it's fixed in a particular way right now
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.960]   that it doesn't understand the difference
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.480]   between whether it's six by 10
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.140]   doing a challenging workout over here,
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.000]   whether it's putting my hands on the hot cold,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.920]   whether it's a lion stood in front of me or whatever.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.200]   That epinephrine response from the level of the brain
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.700]   down to the whole signaling cascade is the same.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.840]   - And cold I've heard can actually prevent
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.960]   some of the beneficial effects of training
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.360]   that it can actually get in the way
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.040]   of muscle growth, et cetera.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.740]   - Yeah, there's some pretty robust data out there now
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.780]   showing that it definitely has an influence
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.960]   on performance variables like strength and power
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   in particular, but absolutely
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.600]   in terms of muscle hypertrophy.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.640]   And there's a big kind of theme
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.360]   in the world of athletic performance right now
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.500]   in terms of periodization of cold exposure
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.640]   as a recovery modality.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.540]   When do you use cold?
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.720]   Should you be using cold for recovery
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.320]   in periods of high training load
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.720]   when you're actually pursuing
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.080]   maybe general proprietary work
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.920]   where you're actually trying to pursue muscle growth?
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.600]   Well, that's usually where you get the most sore.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.800]   It's usually where you feel the most fatigued,
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.960]   but it's probably not the most beneficial approach
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.300]   to use an ice bath in that scenario
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.480]   because you're dampening,
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.980]   you're dulling the mTOR pathway
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:25.040]   and the hypertrophic signaling pathway.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.120]   Whereas in a competition phase
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.560]   where actually quality of exercise
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.720]   and quality of execution of skill and technical work
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.600]   has to be maintained,
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.220]   you want to throw the kitchen sink of recovery capabilities
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.040]   and recovery interventions in that scenario
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.680]   because you now, the muscle building activity
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.520]   should be in the bank.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.440]   That should have been done in the general preparatory work.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.640]   And now you're focusing on technical execution.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.380]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.220]   - No, it's interesting.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.680]   So if I understand correctly,
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.840]   if I want to maximize muscle growth or power
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.980]   or improvements and adaptations,
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.580]   then the inflammation response,
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.140]   the delayed onset muscle soreness,
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.320]   all this stuff that's uncomfortable
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.360]   and that we hear is so terrible
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.920]   is actually the stimulus for adaptation.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.500]   And so using cold in that situation
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.680]   might short circuit my progress.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.640]   But if I'm, you know, I don't know that I'll ever do this,
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.180]   but if I were to do an Ironman or something
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.520]   or run a marathon under those conditions,
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.960]   I'm basically coming to the race, so to speak,
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.660]   with all the power and strength I'm going to have.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.660]   And so there, reducing inflammation is good
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.600]   because it's going to allow me
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.860]   to perform more work, essentially.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.700]   - Absolutely.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.480]   Yeah, you have to be strategic
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.820]   about when you use some of these interventions.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.200]   And, you know, the time when you're preparing
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.440]   for a competition is not the appropriate time, excuse me,
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.680]   is the appropriate time when you want to drive recovery
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.440]   and make sure that your body is optimized.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.280]   You know, when you're far away from a competition,
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.880]   you know, date or, you know, out of season
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.720]   or whatever it may be,
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.320]   and you're really trying to just tear up the body
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.780]   a little bit to allow it to, it's natural, you know,
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.520]   healing and adaptation processes to take place.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.840]   Well, you don't want to negate that.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.840]   You know, you want the body to optimize
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.960]   its internal recovery,
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.000]   and that's how muscle growth is going to happen, so.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   - So interesting.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.400]   - There's a time kind of consideration
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.360]   that you need to make with these interventions, for sure.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.200]   - At the UFC Performance Center,
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.040]   are the fighters periodizing their cold exposure
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.040]   or are they just doing cold at will?
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.600]   - Well, it's not just the UFC.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.520]   And again, I talk about my personal experiences
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.360]   with different sports.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.160]   I think just education around where science is at,
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.720]   and our understanding of concepts
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.760]   like the use of cold exposure for recovery, ice bath.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.840]   You know, everyone wants to jump in an ice bath.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.960]   But I think as we've stepped back
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.080]   and scientists have started to say,
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.800]   have started to figure out and look at some of the data,
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.320]   you know, we're now more intuitive about,
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.240]   well, actually that might not be the best
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.540]   or the most optimal approach.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.700]   And I think that's any given sport.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.760]   So yes, certainly here at the UFC,
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.840]   we're trying to educate our athletes
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.140]   around, you know, appropriate timing.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.520]   And it's the same with nutrition.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.640]   It's the same with an ice bath intervention.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.260]   It's the same with lifting weights.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.520]   It's the same with going for a run
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.560]   or working out on the bike.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.420]   You know, there's tactics to when you do things
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:18.340]   and when you don't do things.
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:22.360]   And I think, you know, stress and cold exposure,
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.480]   we have to have a consideration around that as well.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.360]   But it's not just, you know, MMA fighters.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.860]   That's any athlete.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:32.160]   And I think it's the best professionals,
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.280]   the most successful professionals do that really well.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.980]   They listen, number one.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.300]   They educate themselves and then they build structure.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.780]   And I think, you know, at the most elite level,
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.700]   we always talk about it here at the UFC,
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.220]   but the most elite level,
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:49.120]   you're not necessarily training harder than anybody else.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.760]   Everybody in the UFC trains hard.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.240]   Like everyone is training super hard.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.240]   But the best athletes, the true elite levels
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.560]   are the ones that can do it again and again and again
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.520]   on a daily basis and sustain a technical output
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.680]   for skill development.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.160]   Therefore their skills can improve
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   or physical development,
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.240]   their physical attributes can improve.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.480]   So that ability to reproduce on a day-to-day basis
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.560]   falls into a recovery conversation.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.200]   Now, when is the right time to use
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.800]   something like an ice bath and when isn't
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:21.640]   is part of the high-performance conversation for sure.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.080]   - So really they're scientists.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.040]   They're building structure.
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.720]   They're figuring out variables.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.680]   But it sounds like the ability to do more quality work
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.640]   over time is one of the key variables.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.000]   - I mean, it's fundamental.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.080]   I mean, garbage in, garbage out, quality in, quality out.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:41.200]   But in our sport, I talk about mixed martial arts,
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.360]   it's truly a decathlon of combat.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.040]   So there's so many different attributes,
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.900]   whether it's a grappling, whether it's a wrestling,
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.160]   whether it's a transition work,
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.740]   whether it's a standup striking.
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.900]   So the different facets of a training program in this sport
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:57.560]   are significantly large compared to something like
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.120]   a wide receiver in football.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.760]   And that's no disrespect for wide receivers,
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.800]   but they run routes.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.200]   They're gonna run a route, a passing tree,
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.360]   and that's all they need to do.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.800]   These guys have to be on the ground.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.680]   They gotta be great on the ground.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.760]   They gotta be great standing up.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.420]   They gotta be great with the back against the fence.
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.000]   There's so many different kind of facets to our sport.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.840]   So managing the distribution of all the training components
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.480]   is one of the biggest challenges of mixed martial arts.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.820]   And the best guys get that right.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:28.560]   They allow their body to optimize the training.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.320]   And remember, why are we doing training?
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:34.780]   We're doing training for technical and tactical improvement.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.120]   Now, if your body is fatigued
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.180]   or you just can't expose yourself
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.600]   to more tactical development or technical development,
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.660]   then you're essentially doing yourself a disservice.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.380]   You're gonna be behind the curve
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:48.400]   with respect to those guys
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.720]   that can reproduce that day in, day out.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.160]   - On the topic of skill development, regardless of sport,
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:00.120]   we hear all the time, and it certainly is intuitive to me,
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.900]   that the person who can focus the best
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.260]   will progress the fastest.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:06.100]   But it's kind of interesting.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.400]   Sometimes I talk to athletes
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:12.260]   and they seem a little bit laid back
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.200]   about their training sometimes,
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.800]   and yet they obviously know how to flip the switch
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.480]   and they can really dial in the intensity.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.560]   Do you think that there are optimal protocols
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.660]   for skill learning in terms of physical skill learning?
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.400]   Like, could it ever be parameterized
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.660]   like the six sets of 10 reps?
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.680]   And this gets to the heart of neuroplasticity,
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.180]   which is still, it's not a black box,
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.120]   but it's kind of a black box
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.500]   with portions of it illuminated, I like to say.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.360]   But what are your thoughts on skill development?
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.780]   Is there, for somebody that wants to get better at sport,
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:48.480]   do you recommend a particularly long
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.200]   or short training session?
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.780]   It does intensity matter, or is it just reps?
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:58.280]   - Yeah, I think, no, it's not a volume-driven exercise.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.120]   It's a quality-driven exercise.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.720]   And listen, my expertise is not in motor learning
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.760]   and motor skill acquisition.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   I tend to default to Dr. Gabrielle Wolf here
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.400]   at UNLV for that.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.420]   She's one of the leading proponents in this area.
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:17.120]   But if you look at true skill development,
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:21.380]   it is about rehearsal of accurate movement,
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.100]   accurate movement mechanics.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:27.680]   And as soon as that becomes impacted by fatigue
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.360]   or inaccurate movement,
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.520]   you're now losing the motor learning.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.440]   You're losing the accuracy of the skill
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.140]   that people can call it muscle memory
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.120]   or whatever they want, right?
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.360]   But essentially, you're grooving neural axons
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.200]   to create movement patterns,
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.800]   and they're situational throughout sport, right?
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.640]   You know, whether it's a cruyff turn in soccer
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.680]   or a jump shot in basketball or a forehand down the line,
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.800]   you can carve out that particular posture
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.420]   and position and skill, and you can isolate it,
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.520]   and you can drill it again and again and again.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.000]   Now, as soon as fatigue is influencing that repetition,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.940]   it's time to stop.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.740]   And the best coaches understand that.
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.360]   They understand that it's quality over quantity
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.280]   when it comes to skill acquisition.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.640]   So to answer your question in a roundabout way,
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.880]   I would say, yes, it's shorter sessions
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.820]   that are very high quality.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.820]   And I think the best athletes, in my experience,
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:24.560]   are the ones that consciously and cognitively
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.080]   are aware of it at every moment of the training session.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.040]   They should leave the training session
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.840]   not necessarily just physically fatigued,
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.440]   but mentally fatigued because they're completely engaged
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.740]   in the learning process.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.240]   The problem then becomes, okay,
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.480]   if we just do lots of 30 minute sessions,
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.440]   we've gotta do a lot of 30 minute sessions
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.760]   to get the volume exposure of the repetition
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.640]   and the rehearsal of the skill again and again and again.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.680]   So it's a bit of a paradox.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.580]   It's a bit of a double-edged sword.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.260]   But a three hour session versus a 90 minute session,
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.880]   we'll take the 90 minute session any day
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.400]   when it comes to skill acquisition
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   because that's gonna be driven by quality over quantity.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.420]   - Yeah, training and skill learning
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.700]   is incredibly mentally fatiguing.
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:13.000]   I've often wondered why when one works out hard,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.640]   whether or not it's with a run or with the weights,
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.900]   why it's hard to think later in the day.
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:18.740]   - Right.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:21.460]   - Yeah, there really does seem to be something to it.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:26.440]   And I've wondered, is it depletion of adrenaline, dopamine?
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.440]   I sometimes think it might be dopamine.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.880]   And here I'm totally speculating.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.300]   I don't have any data to support this.
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:35.880]   But if you hit a really hard workout or run early in the day
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.320]   oftentimes the brain just doesn't want
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.860]   to do hard mental work,
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.980]   which gives me great admiration for these athletes
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:45.160]   that are drilling their mind and body all day every day
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.120]   with breaks.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.480]   But so what are your thoughts?
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:53.220]   What leads to the mental fatigue after physical performance?
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.760]   - Well, again, I don't want to talk out.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.860]   You know, I'm talking to the man here, you know, this-
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.820]   - Well, we're just two scientists speculating on this point.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.840]   Up until now, you've been giving us
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:06.300]   concrete peer-reviewed study-based feedback on my questions.
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.780]   But if we were to speculate,
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:09.040]   I mean, I think this is a common occurrence.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.940]   People think if I get that really good workout
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.780]   in in the morning, I feel better all day.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:16.380]   That's true, unless that workout is really intense
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.580]   or really long.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.780]   And then you just, the mind just somehow
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:25.100]   won't latch on to mental work quite as well.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.460]   - I mean, just philosophically,
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.780]   you know, I think there's a,
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.960]   coming back to this kind of stress consideration,
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.340]   you know, like a public speaking or taking an exam.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.620]   I mean, if you have an amazing coach
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.520]   who is setting up training in a particular way,
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.620]   it's challenging.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.220]   There's a strain related to it.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:43.440]   And I'm not talking physical strain.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.900]   I'm talking figuring things out, you know,
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.460]   figuring out the skill.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.180]   And I think that can be stressful.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.420]   Like the learning process can be stressful.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.820]   So, you know, we've touched on stress.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:58.240]   I also think if they hit the right technique,
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.060]   you know, that reward center in the brain,
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.020]   that dopamine shot is gonna fly up there.
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.540]   And there's only so many times that we can get that
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.380]   before that becomes dampened.
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.300]   And I think there's an energetic piece to it.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.620]   You know, there's the fueling of the brain.
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:15.140]   There's the carbohydrate fueling exercise
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:19.540]   that actually the strategy around how you fuel for learning
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:23.300]   and fuel for physical training is actually pretty similar.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.140]   - Glucose.
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.340]   - Yeah, it's glucose.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.420]   It's sugar at the end of the day, right?
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.260]   So, you know, are you fueling accordingly
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:31.580]   around your training sessions?
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:33.620]   Be that very physical 'cause everyone thinks,
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.740]   okay, you know, I'm gonna jump on a treadmill
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:40.060]   and I'm gonna bang out, you know, 15 sprints at max effort.
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:41.940]   And I'm gonna be dropping off
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.340]   and lying on the floor at the end of it.
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:44.660]   I need to refuel.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.140]   - Well, what about the refueling of the brain
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:51.340]   in a very demanding exercise or drilling session
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.700]   where you're looking at technique
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.020]   that you're trying to figure out
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:55.580]   that's very challenging for your mind
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.780]   to figure out the complexity of it,
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.900]   but still needs to be fueled or refueled afterwards.
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.820]   And I think that's obviously, you know,
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.740]   might be an area where athletes do themselves a disservice
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.380]   by not appropriately fueling
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.740]   from what might be considered to be
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.940]   a lower intensity session,
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:15.300]   but the cognitive challenge has been significantly high.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.420]   - So they're doing skill work or drill work
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.380]   and it's taxing the brain.
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.060]   And they're thinking, oh, you know,
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.240]   I wasn't, you know, pushing hard lifts or doing sprints.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.780]   And so I can just go off the rest of my day,
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:29.220]   but then their mind is drifting.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.940]   - Yeah, I mean, I speculate.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.940]   - Yeah, that seems very reasonable.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.580]   I mean, I know that I'm here
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.660]   and presumably with the other athletes you've worked with,
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:40.340]   nutrition is a huge aspect of that.
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.300]   And I think the general public can learn a lot
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:45.620]   from athletic nutrition because at the end of the day,
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.980]   the general public is trying to attend to their kids,
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:49.720]   attend to their work, whether or not they're lawyers
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.260]   or whatever, they need to focus.
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.280]   Nutrition is a barbed wire topic.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.120]   - Oh yeah.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.100]   - But since we're free to do what we would do
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.740]   if we were just sitting in each other's offices,
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:04.660]   which is to just speculate a bit.
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.900]   For the typical person, right,
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.460]   do you think these low carbohydrate diets,
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:13.080]   typical person who exercises, runs, swims, yoga,
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.780]   lifts weights, maybe not all those things,
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.820]   but some collection of those,
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:19.740]   pushes themselves to do those things and to do them well,
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.580]   but isn't necessarily a highly competitive athlete?
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:25.640]   Do you think that nutrition
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.600]   that doesn't include a lot of glucose,
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:32.020]   doesn't include a lot of carbohydrates is a problem?
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:33.380]   Or is it okay?
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.420]   What do you recommend for athletes?
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:37.140]   What do you recommend for typical people?
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:41.140]   - Yeah, again, disclaimer, I'm not a dietician, but I-
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.540]   - That's okay, the dieticians don't know
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.300]   what to recommend to athletes either.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.780]   And I say that from having to spend a lot of time
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.160]   with the literature now, it's a complete mess.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.700]   It's like, I thought we didn't understand anything
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.460]   about the brain, the nutrition science stuff
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.100]   is all over the place.
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:59.540]   So I think we have, again, a large degrees of freedom.
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:04.340]   - I mean, I think it comes down to metabolic efficiency.
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:09.020]   So we would never advocate, I never say never, okay?
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.800]   But we rarely advocate a high-performance athlete
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:16.320]   in a high-intensity intermittent sport, like MMA,
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:20.060]   being totally ketogenic or being-
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.220]   - You do not recommend that?
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.460]   - No, because at the end of the day,
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.900]   some of those high-intensity efforts
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:29.140]   usually require carbohydrate fueling
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:34.140]   for the energy produced at those high intensities.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.840]   So we try to navigate around that.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.580]   Now, listen, there are fighters in the UFC and elsewhere.
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.540]   Matt Brown is a great example
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.360]   who promotes the ketogenic approach and it works for him.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.500]   But we look at the science and the nature,
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.700]   the characteristics of our sport
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.040]   and we don't necessarily promote that.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.300]   - Can I interrupt you real quick?
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.600]   What about ketones for people
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.620]   that are ingesting carbohydrates?
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:57.700]   This is an interesting area
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.600]   because people always hear ketones and they think,
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.820]   oh, I have to be ketogenic to benefit from taking ketones.
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.180]   But there are a number of athletes
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.340]   and recreational athletes now as well
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:11.340]   taking liquid or powder-based ketones
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.860]   even though they do eat rice and oatmeal
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:15.780]   and bread and other things.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.180]   So are there any known benefits of ketones
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.940]   even if one is not in a state of ketosis?
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:26.940]   - So the use of ketones that I'm primarily aware of
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:31.300]   is in our sport is after the event,
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.620]   in terms of the brain health with athletes
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:36.500]   that are potentially taking trauma to the brain, et cetera,
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.100]   and looking to maintain the fueling
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.900]   and the energy supply to the brain.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.120]   But yes, it's probably a little bit out of my remit
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.000]   so I don't want to talk on that
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.940]   because I'm not fully familiar with that.
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.820]   - Well, I've heard that ketones after head injury
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:51.500]   can provide a buffering component.
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:52.340]   - Correct.
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.360]   - It's not going to reverse brain damage,
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.020]   but it might be able to offset some of the micro damage.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.340]   - Right, so that's how we use it,
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.900]   just to sustain the energy supply
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:04.940]   to the brain that might be compromised through brain trauma.
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:07.500]   So that's why we use ketones.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.860]   To come back to the original question,
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.380]   if it's a general population, then yes,
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.180]   I think there's a place to argue
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.860]   that actually being on a ketogenic diet at times,
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.940]   and maybe it's a cycling exercise,
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:19.940]   maybe not, I don't mean cycling a bike,
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:23.840]   I mean cycling ketosis is beneficial
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.140]   because I think it's going to lead
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.980]   to better metabolic management and metabolic efficiency.
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:31.740]   Those lower intensities where we should be fueling
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:35.700]   our metabolism with lipids and fats,
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:39.260]   clearly the Western diet and the modern day diets
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:42.840]   is heavily driven by processed foods and carbohydrates
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.780]   that people become predisposed to utilization
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:50.780]   of that fuel source above lipids use, fat use,
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.660]   intensities that are very low.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:56.380]   So some of our data with the fighters shows that as well.
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.280]   But I think the challenge for us
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.160]   is that we're working with a clientele
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.260]   that require high intensity bouts of effort.
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:07.000]   So fueling appropriately is very important for that.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.800]   Now we use tactics here where we essentially have athletes
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.460]   on what you would say kind of is it a largely
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:18.520]   a ketogenic diet, but then we will fuel carbohydrates
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.380]   around training sessions.
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:23.580]   So we'll do very timed exposure to carbohydrates.
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:24.920]   So it's not-- - Post training.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.820]   - Post training, immediately pre, during,
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.180]   and then immediately post.
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.720]   And then the rest of their diets, you know,
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:34.140]   breakfast, lunch, and dinner are what would look like
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.760]   ketogenic type approaches.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.200]   So we're trying to be very tactical in the exposure
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.380]   to maximize the intensity for the training
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.880]   and then return to a metabolically efficient diet,
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.760]   which is heavily reduced in carbohydrate
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.840]   because we've fueled the sessions that need it.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:54.560]   - I'm smiling because once again, this place,
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:57.140]   the UFC Performance Center is doing things
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:00.480]   scientifically, which, you know, to me, the idea that,
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.720]   and I'm pleased to hear that because to me,
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.900]   this idea that the ketogenic diet is the best and only diet
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:09.520]   or carbohydrates and low protein diets are the best diet.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.120]   It's just, it's ludicrous.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:13.320]   Then you mentioned metabolic efficiency.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.000]   I think some people might be familiar with that term,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.220]   some perhaps not, but the way I understand
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:23.000]   metabolic efficiency is that you teach the body
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   to use fats by maybe doing long bouts of cardio,
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.180]   maybe lowering carbohydrates a bit.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.500]   So teaching the body to tap into its fat stores
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.400]   for certain periods of training.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.620]   And then you also teach the body to utilize carbohydrates
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:40.220]   by supplying carbohydrates immediately after training
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:41.060]   and before training.
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.140]   You teach the body to use ketones
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.820]   and then you use them at the appropriate time
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:47.260]   as opposed to just deciding that one of these fuel sources
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:50.020]   is good and all the others are bad or dispensable.
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.140]   Do I have that correct?
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:51.980]   - You nailed it.
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:56.980]   I mean, from Bob Seabahar, formerly of USA Triathlon,
[00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:01.200]   is the guy that kind of came up with the concept
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.140]   of metabolic efficiency, but yes, you're absolutely right.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:07.260]   I mean, at low intensities of exercise
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.800]   or just day-to-day living, we shouldn't be tapping
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.980]   into our carbohydrate fuel sources extensively.
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:17.300]   That's for higher intensity work or, you know,
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:21.140]   the fight or flight needs of stress, you know?
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:24.220]   If, you know, athletes or any individual
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.960]   has a high carbohydrate diet, they're gonna start
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.420]   to become predisposed to utilizing
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.580]   that fuel source preferentially.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.860]   Now at low intensity, that can be problematic,
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:35.900]   certainly for an athlete,
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:39.480]   because if they preferentially use carbohydrate
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.840]   at lower intensities, when the exercise demand
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.100]   goes to a higher intensity,
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.140]   they've already exhausted their fuel stores.
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.740]   You know, they can't draw upon fat
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:51.040]   because the oxidization of that fat is just too slow.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.600]   So they're essentially now become fatigued
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.700]   because they've already utilized the carbohydrate stores.
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.420]   So what we try to do, yes, through diet manipulation
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.260]   and a little bit of exercise manipulation is, as you say,
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:03.780]   teach the body or train the body
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:06.540]   to preferentially use a specific fuel source.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.220]   Fat, obviously, at lower intensities
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.800]   and carbohydrate at high intensities.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.300]   And we look at specifically the crossover point
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.340]   between the two tells a lot in terms of how an athlete
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.900]   is ultimately, you know, how their metabolism is working.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.320]   - Well, again, I'm smiling because I love this
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.080]   because it's grounded in something real and scientific,
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.980]   which is that we have these different fuel sources.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.240]   The body can adapt to use any number of them or one of them.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.480]   I think most people are looking for that one pattern
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.440]   of eating, that one pattern of exercising
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.160]   that's going to be best for them or sustain them.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.320]   And they often look back to the time
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.520]   when they felt so much better
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.080]   switching from one thing to the next.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.360]   But the adaptation process itself is also key, right?
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.520]   Teaching the body.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.900]   And I, so if we were to just riff on this
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.640]   just a little bit further, if somebody,
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.100]   I'll use myself as an example
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.460]   since I can only speculate
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.820]   what other people's current nutrition protocols are,
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.540]   but if somebody is eating in a particular way
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.600]   and they want to try this kind of periodization of nutrition
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.820]   could one say, okay, for a few weeks,
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.960]   I'm going to do more high intensity interval training
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.800]   and weight training,
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.160]   and I'm going to eat a bit more carbohydrate
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.780]   because I'm depleting more glycogen.
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.600]   Then if I switch to a phase of my training
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.720]   where I'm doing some longer runs,
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.220]   maybe I'm training less,
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:26.620]   maybe I'm just working at my desk a little bit more,
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:29.020]   then I might switch to a lower carbohydrate diet.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:29.860]   Do I have that right?
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.900]   And then if I'm going to enter a competition of some sort,
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.580]   certainly not UFC or MMA of any kind to be clear,
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:39.640]   not because it isn't a wonderful sport,
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.800]   but because that wouldn't be good for my other profession.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.080]   But if I were going to do that,
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.720]   then I would think about stacking carbohydrates,
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.300]   ketones, and fats.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.900]   Do I have that more of a strength?
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.620]   - I think, yeah, you just said it eloquently.
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:54.540]   At the end of the day,
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.060]   you're consciously understanding
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:01.940]   what the exposure to physical exertion is,
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.060]   and you're flexing your diet accordingly.
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.460]   - So it's need-based eating.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.620]   - Exactly, and for one of the better terms,
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.660]   you can call it whatever fancy terminology
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.500]   there is out there,
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.660]   but yes, it's needs-based eating,
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.760]   but you're very conscious and cognizant
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.520]   of what is my current exercise status.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.780]   If I'm taking some time off,
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.960]   then don't gorge on the carbohydrates.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.040]   We probably need to be cut.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.700]   It's going to be lower intensity work
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.440]   or even just habitual day-to-day walking around,
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.800]   doing your groceries.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.420]   That doesn't require massive amounts of glycogen storage
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.520]   and carbohydrate fueling.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.860]   So you can potentially go more ketogenic in nature,
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.480]   oxidizing lipids for that fuel.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.020]   If you are in a high period of high-intensity training,
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:50.000]   then you have to consciously flex your diet to support that.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:50.840]   That's not normal.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.660]   You've made a change.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.060]   You've elevated the demand.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.660]   So the fueling requirements for the regenerative,
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.060]   not only fueling the exercise,
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.140]   but the regenerative requirements of your body
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.340]   after that type of work
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.080]   is going to be really important as well.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.980]   So yes, take on more carbohydrates.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.060]   So I think it's consciously interpreting
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.780]   the nature of your diet against what,
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.980]   where you are at any moment in time.
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:15.000]   Like that, you know, I think the listeners of my podcast
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.480]   generally are experimenters.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.980]   They are scientists of themselves,
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.640]   which makes me happy, obviously.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.000]   And I like to think that they're paying attention
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.560]   to the changes they're making
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.660]   and how they're affecting themselves.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:31.040]   And they seem more open to trying things,
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.360]   provided they can do it safely, you know,
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.420]   and seeing what works for them.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.040]   And I'm certainly going to try some of the change up.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.120]   I also am really a creature of habit.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.240]   And I think the, talking to you today, I realize
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.320]   I'm probably doing a number of things truly wrong
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.420]   in my training, but also that I don't tend to vary
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.080]   my nutrition with my training quite as much as I should.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.380]   I'm just locked into a protocol.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:57.600]   We covered a number of things related to your PhD thesis work
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.720]   and then, but I cut you off early on
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.680]   related to your trajectory.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.000]   After you finished your thesis,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.480]   you, I know you were at Notre Dame for a while.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.800]   Was that your first spot after your PhD thesis?
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.400]   - No, no, I basically finished my PhD
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.640]   and I dropped into the British Olympic system
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.080]   for about 14 years.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.920]   - Oh my, okay.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.300]   - I was with, you know, I've done three full Olympic cycles
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.560]   with different sports and largely a strength
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.840]   and conditioning coach as a practitioner.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.560]   I was always working in universities and academia
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.860]   alongside, you know, in terms of continuing to publish
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:37.120]   and write and do research and teach as well.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.000]   - 'Cause that explains the huge volume of publications.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.280]   I don't think people realize the work that goes into
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.780]   getting a quality peer reviewed publication.
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.320]   It's not, what do they call it now on Instagram?
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.280]   Anecdata, where people would do something,
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.240]   what, you know, they have this experience
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.560]   and then they put it in the world.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.040]   Anecdata are, I don't even know that
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.360]   we should call it data, but so 14 years
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.600]   in working with the British Olympic team.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.800]   - Yeah, so with, you know, whether it was GB boxing,
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.740]   primarily with the Rio, excuse me, the Beijing cycle,
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.720]   but also lightweight rowers and gymnastics.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.600]   For the London Olympic games, that cycle I was with,
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.120]   I was the lead strength and conditioning
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.320]   and physical performance coach for British basketball,
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.400]   so GB basketball.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.000]   I had about three years in the English Premier League
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.600]   with Newcastle United and the soccer team.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.380]   And then for the Rio Olympic cycle,
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.760]   I was with Great Britain Taekwondo.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.540]   So again, another combat sport.
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:35.020]   After I'd finished there, I kind of moved
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.060]   to the University of Notre Dame,
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.880]   where I went into more of a managerial position
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.660]   working across all the different technical services,
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.900]   medical, nutrition, strength and conditioning,
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.440]   you know, psychology, whatever, sports science,
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:53.440]   whatever it may be, as the director of performance sciences
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.540]   for Notre Dame athletics.
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:57.500]   And then after about 16 months there,
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:01.040]   the UFC came knocking and they recruited me out of Notre Dame
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.200]   so it's been a great ride.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.540]   And lots of, you know, I've got, you know,
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:08.240]   lots of athletes have taught me a lot along the way,
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.560]   lots of coaches, you know, every day is a school day.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.920]   I still try and keep that mentality.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.200]   And, you know, in this world,
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.600]   we call it white belt mentality, you know,
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.960]   it's, you know, I'm a PhD.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.160]   I've got 25 years of experience in high performance sport,
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.100]   but I still learn every single day
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.080]   from these people out on the mats and in the ring
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.780]   and it's impressive to see what they do.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:29.740]   - Yeah, it certainly is.
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:32.800]   I got introduced to MMA just a few years ago.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.240]   I think the first time I came out here
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.460]   was one of the first times I'd heard of MMA
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:39.200]   'cause I was kind of in my laboratory, you know, nose down.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.780]   And it's a really interesting sport
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.960]   because it incorporates so many different types of movement,
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.600]   as you said, you know, it's not just stand up boxing,
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.260]   it's just kicking, it's, you know, ground game, everything,
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:52.000]   and I'm still learning about it.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.080]   But as you mentioned, going in with that beginner's mind,
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.400]   the white belt mentality,
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.220]   what has been the most surprising thing for you
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.880]   in terms of being exposed to MMA in particular,
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.940]   as opposed to other sports?
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.040]   Like what's unique about MMA fighters
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.040]   besides that they have this huge variety
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:16.040]   of tactical skills that they have to learn and perfect?
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.700]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.540]   I would say two things.
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.560]   I'm going to answer two questions.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.460]   One actually reiterates what you've already said.
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:26.520]   Like the degrees of freedom in mixed martial arts
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:30.040]   are exponential, like no other sports, you know.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.000]   We've got 11 different weight classes.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.080]   We have men's classes, we have women's classes,
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.000]   we have, you know, kickboxers, wrestlers,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.280]   jiu-jitsu fighters, judokas, you know, like karate fighters.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.360]   You know, the stylistic backgrounds are infinite.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:46.080]   We have, we're a weight classification sport.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.400]   There's a whole issue relating to making weight
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.800]   and then rebounding to fight about 24 to 30 hours.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.880]   Like just the variability in this sport,
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.480]   the considerations that you have to make are unprecedented
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.240]   compared to any other sport that I've worked with.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:06.320]   And a lot of them go against and are the antithesis
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.760]   of what you would expect for a high performance.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.540]   You know, in terms of we don't always have
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:15.080]   a very clearly defined competition schedule.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.280]   You know, once these guys fight,
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.580]   they don't necessarily know
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:18.760]   when their next fight's going to be.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.880]   - What's the closest spacing of a fight?
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.780]   - I mean, listen, I think the record is around,
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.260]   it's just over a month, I believe.
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.360]   - Goodness.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.080]   - So, you know, that's a quick turnaround,
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.260]   but most of these guys are fighting, you know,
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.620]   three or four times a year.
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:36.300]   Three times a year is pretty normal.
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:39.040]   The bigger fights, maybe two times a year,
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.900]   but invariably the guys don't know
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:42.900]   when that next date is going to be.
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:45.620]   So we're in this gray area of, okay, what do we do?
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.380]   Like, are we taking some time off?
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:49.220]   Are we just going to do some general prep work?
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.860]   Are we going to try and keep this, you know,
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:53.380]   the knife sharpened in case I get-
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:54.220]   - I didn't realize this.
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.880]   In that way, it's a lot like special operations.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.720]   - Absolutely.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.060]   You don't know when the call's going to happen.
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.700]   - They have to be ready at all times.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.700]   There isn't this like, let's get ready for the season.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:03.540]   - Right.
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:06.180]   Yeah, like when I was with the British Olympic Association,
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:09.140]   you know, I knew it was the British Open, the Spanish Open,
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.100]   the French Open, the European Championships,
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.600]   the Israeli Open, the American Open, the Canadian Open,
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.440]   the Olympic Games.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.260]   You know, I could-
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.100]   - It's a circuit in your brain.
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.780]   - Right, you just plan like, you know,
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:20.000]   where all the targets are going to be.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.620]   Here, it's a moving target
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.300]   because you might be just hanging out,
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.460]   doing some general prep work,
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:26.240]   and then you might get a short notice fight.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.060]   They give you a quick call and it's in six weeks
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.380]   or five weeks, and okay,
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:31.520]   I've got to ramp everything up really quickly.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.500]   So that's a real challenge in terms of just managing
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.780]   all these different components of mixed martial arts alone.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.140]   To come back to your question,
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.780]   the other thing which is truly fascinating
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:47.420]   about these individuals is their,
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.300]   just their mental resilience.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.060]   And again, we've touched on it in the talk,
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.220]   but you know, the ability to do what they do
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:57.860]   on a daily basis, to look at all the different skillsets
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.460]   that they have to try and engage in
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:01.740]   and bring into their training,
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.460]   to do that and embrace the grind,
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.340]   embrace the process of just learning.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:10.520]   The physical side of our sport is unprecedented,
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.480]   but the mental side, you know,
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.320]   we have a funny saying here,
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.380]   we always say it's 90% mental
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.500]   apart from the 60% that's physical.
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.500]   So, you know, it's just more and more and more.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:26.500]   And these guys' ability to just do that on a daily basis
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.460]   is very impressive.
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.900]   Like their resilience, their internal drive
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.220]   and their resilience is really impressive to see.
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:35.460]   - You know, all the fighters I've met here
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:37.980]   have been really terrific, it's interesting.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.420]   Every time I meet a fighter, how often I,
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:41.840]   I shouldn't be surprising where they're often
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.260]   very soft-spoken. - Right.
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.460]   - Always extremely polite. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.340]   - And fighting is such a, you know,
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:50.740]   it comes from a very primitive portion of the brain, right?
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.500]   But a large portion of the brain nonetheless.
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.820]   - But I think that's another skill is that switch, you know?
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.460]   And again, that's the recoverability piece, right?
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.340]   Like you cannot be type A
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.360]   or you cannot be like supercharged 24 hours a day
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.700]   because you're going to just fry your system, right?
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.860]   And I think that's something else
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:08.960]   where we're really trying to manage this whole process,
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.200]   be it through nutritional interventions,
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.940]   be it through education around sleep,
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:16.580]   be it through training program management,
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.000]   be it through psychological interventions.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.500]   You know, you could look at fights and say like,
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500]   these guys are go, like they're red alert
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.980]   and they'll run through a brick wall.
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:28.180]   But actually, again, their ability to turn it on and off
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:30.140]   means that they can do what they do.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:33.180]   You know, they can bring it down and be very normal,
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:37.160]   very polite, very, you know, accommodating.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.620]   - Maybe even better than most people,
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.580]   because, you know, one of the reasons I'm obsessed
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.760]   with human performance and high performance
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.160]   and people like fighters and, you know, elite military
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.420]   or even bodybuilders for that matter
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.200]   is that they experiment,
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.700]   they find the outer limits of what's possible,
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.360]   but one of the things that they have discovered
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.640]   as you're describing is this ability to toggle
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.040]   between high alert states and calm states.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.660]   Most typical people can't do this.
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.740]   They see something that upsets them on the internet
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:06.940]   or something on the news
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.400]   or some external event pressures down on them
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.300]   and they're stressed for many, many days and weeks
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.480]   and sometimes it goes pathological, right?
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.600]   And this, I don't say this as a criticism,
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.420]   it's just that most human beings within our species,
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.420]   most members of our species never learn
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:23.460]   to either flip the switch
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:26.440]   or to just voluntarily toggle between states.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.700]   I think athletes learn how to do that extremely well.
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:33.020]   And it sounds like MMA fighters do that even better
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.220]   than perhaps many other athletes.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.240]   - I mean, yeah, there's the odd one or two
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.080]   that we'd struggle with,
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.020]   but I think in terms of that chronic exposure,
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.740]   we see that coming from challenges around,
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:47.400]   cyclical weight cutting and metabolic disruption
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.300]   and metabolic injury,
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.620]   not necessarily from the psychological drive.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:55.200]   They do understand that this is a job for them
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.300]   and the time on the mats.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.500]   Most of them can turn it off a little bit
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.980]   and downgrade things when they're off the mats.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:03.980]   It's impressive to see.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:05.660]   Because again, as a layman,
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:08.060]   just looking at the fight game,
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.620]   you think it's gonna be crazy chaotic,
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.180]   100 miles an hour, every hour of every day,
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:15.520]   but that's clearly not the case.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.200]   They manage their energy and their efforts pretty well.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.460]   - So it's a little bit like science,
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.380]   although maybe scientists could take a lesson from it.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.300]   - Yeah, it's evidence-based practice
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.700]   or practice-based evidence, right?
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:28.800]   - I like that, that's good.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:29.680]   A couple more questions.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.080]   I can't help myself.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.080]   I know we talked about temperature earlier
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.020]   when we discussed cold, but I can't help myself.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.840]   I have to ask you about heat.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.260]   Because earlier we were having a conversation
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.740]   about heat adaptation,
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:45.780]   about how long does it take for the human body
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.380]   or athlete or typical person
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.420]   that's maybe exploring sauna or things of that sort
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.860]   to learn to be a better sweater?
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:55.020]   It sounds like something none of us would want to do.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.780]   We all want to stay cool, calm, and collected.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:15:00.100]   But one of the reasons to deliberately expose oneself to heat
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.740]   is for things like growth hormone release, et cetera.
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:06.460]   We can talk about this, but a couple of questions.
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:09.180]   One, is heat exposure stress in the same way
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:13.380]   that the ice bath or cold exposure is stress?
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.220]   The second one is,
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.660]   is there any difference there that's important?
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.020]   And the other one is,
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.440]   how does one get better at heat adaptation?
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.860]   Or at least what are you doing with the fighters
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.020]   to get them better at dealing with heat?
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:24.860]   How long does that take?
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:25.940]   So the first question,
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:28.220]   just 'cause I threw three questions at you,
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:33.220]   is, was, you know, is heat stress like cold is stress?
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.260]   - Yeah, I think it is.
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.460]   And I think, you know, heat shock proteins, for example,
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:39.260]   are driven by that stressful exposure
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.540]   to a changing environment.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:42.960]   So I think, you know,
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.400]   we do graded response in terms of heat acclimation
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:50.160]   strategies, but yes,
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.040]   we've touched on it earlier in the conversation.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.260]   For me, heat is still a stressor.
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:56.980]   And if it's managed incorrectly,
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:59.580]   you can have detrimental responses
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.100]   rather than beneficial responses.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.240]   - So barring like hyperthermia and death,
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.120]   like, I mean, obviously you heat up the brain too much,
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:09.000]   people will have seizures and die, but you lose neurons.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.440]   But what's the right way to acclimate heat?
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.380]   Taking into account that people are, you know,
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.120]   should check with their doctor, et cetera,
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.400]   we do all these disclaimers.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.160]   But, you know, but let's say I,
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.660]   let's just say I want to get better at dealing with heat
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.020]   or I want to extract more benefit from heat.
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:25.580]   Is, I mean, how many minutes a day
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.760]   are people typically exposing themselves to heat?
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.300]   How often and over what periods of time?
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.180]   - Yeah, so we normally start
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:34.000]   with about 15 minutes of exposure.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.380]   Now, if someone's really lacking acclimation to heat,
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.060]   you know, you can do that in three, five minute efforts.
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:40.900]   Do you know what I mean?
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.220]   And actually take time- - This is hot sauna.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.980]   - Yeah, hot sauna, take time to step-
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.500]   - 200 degrees or something like Fahrenheit.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.100]   - Correct, yeah, yeah, 200 Fahrenheit, yes.
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.320]   And we try to work up to 30 to 40 minutes
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.940]   to 45 minutes in the sauna continuous.
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:56.540]   Now we have to understand, you know,
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.980]   what's the advantage of heat acclimation for our athletes?
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.380]   Ultimately their ability to sweat
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:05.180]   and to lose, you know, body fluids
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:08.880]   is going to be advantageous to their weight cut process,
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.180]   their ability to make weight.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.620]   It is a technique that these guys,
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:12.660]   some of these guys adopt.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:16.220]   So if you don't have, you know, high sweat rates,
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:18.120]   it means you're going to have to sit in the sauna
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.640]   for longer and longer and longer
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.520]   to get the same delta in sweat release.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.060]   So the more acclimated you are,
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:28.380]   the more your body is thermogenically adapted,
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:31.520]   the more sweat glands you have, the smaller pores.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.660]   You can sweat more and therefore you'll lose
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:36.220]   that fluid quicker and you spend less time in the sauna.
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:40.060]   So that's why we do it, to try and promote,
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:42.320]   to limit the exposure.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.140]   And it comes back to your first question, is it a stressor?
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:47.660]   Absolutely, it's a stressor if you've got to spend,
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.020]   you know, two hours over, you know,
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.660]   over a four hour period, two hours of it sat in a sauna
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:53.740]   because you- - Yeah, where the phone
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:56.060]   doesn't work, so you can't, you know,
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.680]   people will divorce them from their phone
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.200]   and that's a stressor in itself.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.000]   - Right, I mean, yes, I think, you know,
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.860]   there's a, you know, what we do is we, like anything,
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.060]   we build up in temperature,
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:08.280]   but we build up in volume of exposure.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.960]   So, you know, we start with 15 minutes
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.020]   and then we just try to add on and add on across a time.
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:17.780]   And now for us, we kind of found about 14 sauna exposures
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.080]   starts to really then drive the adaptations
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:20.920]   that we're looking for.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.740]   So it's not a quick fix, you know,
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.340]   a heat acclimation strategy has to happen
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:28.160]   long before fight week or long before the fights.
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.420]   You know, this is a process that has to begin, you know,
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:32.940]   eight to 10 weeks before the fight
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:35.160]   so that we can actually get that adaptation
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.620]   and that tolerance to the stressor, to the exposure of heat.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:40.360]   - This is interesting, until today,
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.480]   when we talked about this earlier and again now,
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.740]   I didn't realize that,
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.900]   but it makes perfect sense now that I hear it,
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.980]   that heat adaptation is possible,
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:51.460]   that you're basically can train the body
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.480]   to become better at cooling itself,
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.020]   which is what sweating is.
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:56.740]   I mean, I should have known that before,
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.760]   but you know, you don't see that in the textbooks.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.600]   And so, yeah.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:03.300]   - I mean, listen, it's the same
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.840]   as the ketogenic conversation.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.020]   You know, you're training your body
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.800]   to be more metabolic efficient.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.260]   You're training your body to tolerate heat more.
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:13.220]   You're training your body, like the body is, you know,
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:15.880]   as an organism, as an organic system,
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.700]   it's hugely adaptable, it's hugely plastic.
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.860]   But I think the skill is understanding the whens,
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:26.120]   the whys and the where ofs in terms of changing the overload,
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:29.360]   changing the stimulus to drive specific adaptation.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.440]   And philosophically, that's how we go about our work here.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.600]   We talk about adaptation-led programming.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.920]   Now, adaptation-led programming
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.740]   fits into every single category,
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.920]   not just lifting weights or running track.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.280]   It fits into nutrition.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.220]   It fits into sitting in the sauna.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.140]   It fits into being in a cold bath or not.
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:49.000]   It fits into so many different things
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.940]   because we're driven by scientific insights.
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:54.440]   And that's how we really want to go about our business.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.280]   - I love it.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.360]   I love the concept of adaptation-led programming
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.920]   and doing that, not just in the context of, you know,
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.220]   throwing another plate on the bar or something like that,
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:06.680]   but in every aspect of one's training and performance.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.280]   And I think there's a lot here that's applicable
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.200]   to the recreational athlete too.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.040]   - Yeah.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.520]   - Would you say that, you know,
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.360]   what comes to mind is 12 weeks.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.760]   It feels like 12 weeks is a nice block of time
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.180]   for someone to try something in terms of,
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:22.320]   to try something new, see how they adapt, adapt,
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.120]   and then maybe switch to something new.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:27.080]   I realize that it's very hard to throw a kind of pan
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.640]   timeframe around something.
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.240]   But in terms of, if someone wanted to experiment
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.160]   with heat adaptation or experiment with cold adaptation
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.960]   or change up their training regimen or diet
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.400]   and look at metabolic efficiency,
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:43.600]   do you think 12 weeks is a good period of time
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.460]   to really give something a thorough go
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:48.360]   and gain an understanding of how well
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.320]   or how poorly something works for oneself?
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.920]   Or would you say eight is enough or three?
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.040]   - I mean, that's the, how long is a piece of string
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.360]   kind of response, right?
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.720]   I mean, yes, if we're just talking arbitrary numbers.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.320]   - Recreational experimenter, yeah.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.040]   - Three months exposure, 12 week training strategy,
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.480]   12 week intervention is more than adequate to say,
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:12.060]   for 99% of things that change within the body
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:14.760]   that physiologically adapt to a training stimulus
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.060]   or an overload stimulus, you're gonna start to see
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:20.060]   either regression or progression, you know,
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:22.800]   beneficial or detrimental effects within three months,
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.320]   absolutely, I would say so.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.000]   Now, listen, I say that in as much as we do
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.840]   training blocks here that are three weeks long, you know?
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.120]   - That's because of this constraint
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.920]   that sometimes people suddenly have to,
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:34.200]   they get the call to fight.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.980]   - Correct, yeah, so it's like super condensed.
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:41.280]   And, you know, in that scenario, we're always conscious of,
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.520]   is there a body or this individual,
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:48.680]   do they have the ability to tolerate that super overload,
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.540]   that like super condensed exposure?
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.040]   Now, we might be doing that purposefully.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.160]   We might be trying to do an overreaching strategy
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:57.400]   where we're really trying to damage or flex something,
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.160]   and I don't mean like negatively damaged,
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.440]   but like we're trying to damage tissue
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.560]   to really get an adaptive response versus, you know,
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:07.640]   more drawn out 12 week strategy, which is more coherent,
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.680]   more planned out, more structured in nature.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.000]   But yeah, for all your listeners, I would say,
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.700]   if 12 weeks to engage in a process of, you know,
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.720]   trying to change and adapt your body
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:22.160]   or expose yourself to something is more than sufficient
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.960]   to see if it's gonna be the right approach for you.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:29.920]   And I think, you know, the individual interpretation
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.560]   is always has to be considered.
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.400]   And I think that's where it comes back
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.400]   to be a thinking man's athlete
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.800]   or be a thinking man's trainer,
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.640]   like someone that's going through exercise.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.880]   You have to consciously understand
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.580]   where your body's at any moment in time.
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:47.000]   You know, you've gotta be real with yourself.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.580]   You can create a journal, create a log of your training,
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.880]   create a log of your feelings, your subjective feedback
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:54.720]   of, you know, how you felt, your mood, your sleep.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.960]   - Do your athletes do that?
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:58.120]   - Yeah, yeah, we try to promote that
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.520]   because again, that's part of this process, you know.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.460]   Might be 12 weeks for you,
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:06.100]   but I might get the same responses in eight weeks, you know.
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:10.400]   And I think that's another critical theme here
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:15.280]   is that, you know, we could put 15 guys on the mat
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.500]   and give them the same workout
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:20.400]   and there's gonna be 15 different responses
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.920]   to that same workout
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.880]   because the human organism is so complex
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.720]   and in nature that it's gonna adapt differently.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.400]   You know, some people will tolerate it.
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.120]   Some people are gonna be challenged by it.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:33.000]   Some people have got a metabolic makeup
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   that's gonna promote it.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.240]   Some people are metabolically challenged by it.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.800]   You know, there's just so many different things
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.780]   that we have to consider.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:41.800]   And that's what we try to do here.
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.320]   It's the cross we bear is that we try to understand
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.980]   on an individual level how to optimize athletic performance.
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:48.960]   - No, I think it's terrific.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.940]   And, you know, the athletes here are so fortunate
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:53.380]   to have this and most people out there,
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:56.100]   you know, I've certainly been trying to encourage people
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.900]   to learn some science and some mechanism
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.060]   and become scientists of their own pursuits,
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:03.340]   whether or not skill learning or athletic pursuit, et cetera.
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:07.400]   As a sort of a final question,
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.020]   what are some things about the UFC
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.700]   or something about the UFC that perhaps people don't know
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.420]   in terms of its overall mission
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.900]   or what you guys are trying to do here?
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:17.600]   I mean, I think I've become a fan of MMA
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.780]   and I am more and more as time moves on.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.140]   Some people might be in MMA,
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.500]   some people not into watching MMA,
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.340]   but what are some things that the UFC is interested in
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:30.860]   and doing that most people might not know about
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:33.060]   and certainly I might not know about?
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:36.320]   - Yeah, I mean, I think, you know,
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.380]   we try to be cutting edge.
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:41.260]   We try to be super progressive.
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.940]   You know, we think we've got an amazing platform here,
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:45.540]   particularly at the Performance Institute
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:46.720]   to do some really cool things
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.620]   that can inform many different people
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:51.900]   and that doesn't just mean the 600 or so athletes
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:53.980]   that are on our global roster.
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:57.060]   What we're trying to do is influence, you know,
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:00.800]   global community around optimizing human performance.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.600]   So, you know, any moment in time,
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.580]   we're engaging in different technologies
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.700]   with different vendors, different partners,
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:09.180]   you know, exploring opportunities to, you know,
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:12.580]   learn more, share data, understand what's the best mechanisms
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:14.780]   for, you know, interpreting your body,
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:17.020]   interpreting how your body's responding to training,
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.100]   interpreting, you know, your nutrition
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:19.940]   or whatever it may be.
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:23.900]   We get, we're in a really privileged position to do that.
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:26.580]   But we've also, you know, hence you've been here today,
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:29.040]   you know, we're also trying to venture
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.860]   into some really cool areas of science and research
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:34.540]   that's got applicability that you can take
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.980]   from high-performance athletes and apply, you know,
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:39.660]   to yourself, to, you know, Joe Blow walking down the street,
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:42.740]   you know, out there that is really interesting.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:45.100]   And that's everything from, you know,
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.140]   whether it's CBD and psychedelics
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:50.240]   through to different technologies for, you know,
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.060]   thermal monitoring and Bluetooth heart rate monitoring
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:56.600]   or whatever it may be through to data management, et cetera,
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.180]   and anything in between.
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:01.020]   We've got some great partners on the nutrition side,
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:03.460]   on the psychology side, on the data side.
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:07.300]   And I think, you know, we always try to just push the envelope
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:08.140]   a little bit more.
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:10.680]   I think we keep our core mission with our athletes,
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.380]   but I think a lot of what we do, hence your podcast,
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.400]   and you know, like an amazing platform,
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.580]   you do such a great job of it,
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:21.060]   that, you know, we can all learn and take from, you know,
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:23.420]   the elite and interpret how it might help us
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.180]   and just in the general population.
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.540]   So I think that's, you know,
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:29.560]   that's our North Star is to provide our athletes
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.620]   the best integrated service of care.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:35.120]   But we also want to influence, you know,
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.660]   just the global community and put the UFC
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.700]   at the forefront of that.
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:39.520]   - That's great.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.440]   Well, you guys are certainly doing it.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.540]   We can't let the cat out of the bag just yet,
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:45.580]   but the things that we're gearing up to do
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:48.700]   with my laboratory and the work together,
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.140]   hopefully we'll be able to talk about that
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:52.660]   and share that in the year to come.
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:55.140]   But that's, we're very excited about that.
[01:26:55.140 --> 01:27:00.140]   And Duncan, look, you know, I have this filter that I use
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.100]   when I talk to people, academics or otherwise,
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:04.680]   which is, you know, some people, they open their mouth
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.720]   and it doesn't make much difference.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.740]   But when you speak, I learn so much.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.800]   I'm going to take the protocols
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.120]   that I've heard about today.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.680]   I'm going to think about how I'm training
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.140]   and how I could train differently and better,
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:19.920]   how I'm eating, how I could eat differently and better
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.340]   for sake of performance and just in general.
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:27.720]   Thank you so much for your time, your scientific expertise,
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.680]   the stuff you're doing in the practical realm.
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:33.280]   It's immense, so hopefully we can do it again.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.980]   - Yes, thank you, this has been a blast.
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.160]   I appreciate it and yeah, keep doing what you're doing
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.640]   'cause I know there's a lot of people out there
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.560]   that love the platform.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.840]   So thanks for the invite, it's been awesome.
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.960]   - Thank you, thanks so much.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.060]   Thank you for joining me for my conversation
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.800]   with Dr. Duncan French.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.680]   I hope you found it as insightful and informative as I did.

[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:17.460]   That's a terrific way to support this podcast.
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:21.920]   We also have a Patreon, it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.760]   And there you can support the podcast
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.480]   at any level that you like.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:28.320]   Many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.740]   we discuss supplements.
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.180]   Supplements for sleep, supplements for focus,
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:34.320]   and for other health benefits as well.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.120]   While supplements may not be for everybody,
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.420]   if you're going to use supplements,
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:38.860]   you want to make sure that those supplements
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:40.780]   are of the very highest quality.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:44.420]   For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:47.860]   because Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:51.100]   and the amounts of ingredients listed on the label
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:53.140]   of Thorne supplements precisely matches
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.900]   what is actually contained in those capsules, bottles,
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.600]   and pills and powders and so forth.
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.740]   This is extremely important.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.500]   A lot of analyses of supplements and supplement companies
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:04.140]   have shown that what's listed on the bottle
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:07.460]   is often not what's actually contained in the bottle.
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:09.360]   Thorne's stringency is unmatched.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.820]   They've partnered with all the major sports teams,
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:14.340]   with the Mayo Clinic, and so there's a lot of trust
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:16.700]   in Thorne supplements for all the right reasons.
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.500]   If you'd like to try Thorne supplements,
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.240]   you can see the supplements that I take.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:25.240]   You can go to Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:28.000]   There, you can see the supplements that I take.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.220]   You can get 20% off any of those supplements,
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.220]   and if you navigate into the Thorne site
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:34.980]   through that portal, you can get 20% off
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:37.260]   any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:39.260]   I'd also like to mention that if you're not already
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.120]   following us on Instagram @hubermanlab,
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.100]   you might want to do so.
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:45.940]   There, I do brief science tutorials
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:48.960]   and offer science-based protocols for all sorts of things
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:51.700]   that are often separate from the protocols and information
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.780]   covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:56.560]   We're also on Twitter as Huberman Lab.
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.980]   And last and certainly not least,
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:00.780]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:03.360]   [upbeat music]
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.940]   (upbeat music)
