[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.960]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.760]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.520]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.080]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.200]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.840]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.320]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.400]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.680]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.680]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.880]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.160]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.120]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.080]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.160]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.780]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.260]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you to this episode,
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.920]   and I'm excited to answer a few questions
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.400]   that listeners like you have posed over the last six weeks
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.220]   and ask for some insight or for some,
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.000]   maybe not answers per se,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.120]   sometimes what people are looking for
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.840]   are another person's experience,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.200]   or some wisdom gained from the School of Hard Knocks.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.520]   And so that's what I'm gonna offer today.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.520]   I don't pretend to be the absolute expert
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.760]   on parenting, or classical education,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.080]   or homeschooling, or classical Christian homeschooling,
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.560]   or classical conversations and all its programs.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.880]   I can share with you the experiences that I have had,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.720]   that my family has had, the ups and downs,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.440]   the things that I have learned
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.860]   the easy way and the hard way,
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.320]   some wisdom that I have gleaned from friends
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.320]   and fellow travelers along the path of homeschooling
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.840]   through the years.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.960]   I'm glad to share all of those things with you.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.280]   I want you to know that for most of the questions
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.280]   that are posed, there's not one right answer.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.280]   And I know that somehow discouraging to some people
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.080]   to think that there's more than one possible route
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.460]   to a good outcome, but that's the truth.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.440]   As we move through life,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.440]   we have all experienced the fact that
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.000]   while we might want there to be one perfect answer
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.880]   that we could research and find and rest in,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.880]   many times there are a range of answers
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.720]   that are true, or that are applicable,
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.640]   or that fit our situation at any given time.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.600]   So I don't want you to be discouraged when I say
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.200]   that this is Ask Lisa,
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   and I am going to answer your questions,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.960]   but my caveat is that it's not the only answer,
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.600]   and it may not be the best answer for your family.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.720]   I want to tell you a little bit about myself
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.240]   for those of you who are new listeners,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.520]   or maybe those of you who are old listeners,
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.680]   but never knew my whole story.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.160]   I got involved with Classical Conversations,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.960]   believe it or not, 20 years ago.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.400]   When my girls were little, in foundations,
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.180]   we discovered, we found Classical Conversations
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.000]   through some friends who had stumbled on
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   to this amazing community of like-minded families
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.240]   who were pursuing the kind of education
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.840]   that I had been trying to create at home
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.840]   for my two little girls.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.620]   We actually heard about CC a year or so
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.840]   before we were able to join.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.080]   My husband is a pastor, and at that point,
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.720]   we were brand new church planters.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.360]   And so our desire was strong, and I had lots of time,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.160]   but we didn't have a lot of financial resources.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.960]   So the first year, we watched our friends
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.020]   become involved in this community
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.400]   that really looked amazing,
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.040]   but that we felt like we just couldn't afford financially.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.000]   It was not God's timing for us.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.120]   So we continued to do what we had done,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.520]   which I discovered was very classical.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.120]   But then we were able to join
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.920]   a Classical Conversations community
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.920]   when I accepted the call to be a tutor myself.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.600]   So that was our open door into CC,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.840]   and my girls both entered the foundations program,
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.860]   and we loved it.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.680]   They took to it, like fish take to water.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.400]   All that memorization was so much fun to them.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.760]   And having, my daughter said,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.160]   "It's the best of both worlds, Mama.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.840]   We are homeschooled, but we have a class.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.520]   We have friends."
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.800]   They had friends to be with one day a week.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.680]   And I had friends to be with one day a week.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.280]   And I had other students to pour into and love on.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.280]   And my girls had other adults who were pouring into them
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.020]   and loving on them.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.800]   And so we loved our foundations years,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.020]   and we stayed with the program.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.940]   My girls both graduated from Challenge Four,
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.900]   and I was a tutor of various levels
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.800]   and have held lots of positions
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.580]   within Classical Conversations
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.980]   way back when we had state managers.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.960]   There was a state manager for every state,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.140]   and I was blessed to serve as the state manager
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.420]   of North Carolina.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.540]   And I loved that.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.940]   I loved seeing communities all across our state grow.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.100]   What I really loved, though, was encouraging parents
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.100]   that they had what it takes to homeschool their children,
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.340]   that if God had given them the call,
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.140]   that God would equip them to do it.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.740]   And so I loved pouring encouragement into families,
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.420]   moms and dads and students.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.220]   And so in my next CC job,
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.100]   I got to do that sort of full-time.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.100]   I became the practicum guru for all intents and purposes
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.740]   for about seven or eight years for Classical Conversations,
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.020]   designing our summer practicum program
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.200]   and the training that went into equipping facilitators
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.540]   and speakers to lead those great conversations for families
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.900]   as we all grew in our understanding of the classical model.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.220]   And so the whole idea of being able to inspire,
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.220]   encourage and equip families really became my passion.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.860]   And so my responsibility with CC has continued to grow
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.540]   and change and evolve as Classical Conversations
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.700]   has continued to grow and change and evolve.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.700]   And I now serve as the Director of Program Development
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.580]   with CCMM, so with Classical Conversations Multimedia.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.580]   And I have been utterly blessed to be the podcast host
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.180]   of The Everyday Educator for more years than I can remember.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.420]   So I love podcasting
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:55.540]   because it gives me a chance to keep speaking to families,
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.460]   to keep speaking to parents who have questions about,
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.380]   "Can I do this?" or "How should I do this?"
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.780]   or "Now I have this problem," or "What about this resource?"
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.780]   And so I have absolutely loved spending time with you guys
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.260]   every week for the past eight or 10 years,
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.380]   talking about what makes our heart beat,
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:25.100]   our kids and our education of our kids
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.460]   and growing as lead learners in our homes
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.460]   and developing family rhythms of learning.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.940]   One of the projects that I have been able to spend
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.780]   a lot of time on in the last four or five years
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.100]   was Scribblers, the Scribblers resource.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.660]   I was one of the principal writers of Scribblers.
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.020]   And so we're gonna talk about some of those verbs,
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.860]   some of what we call the Scribblers verbs
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.940]   that will help us to assess are we doing enough
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.740]   and has it been a good day?
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.140]   Because y'all, sometimes you get to the end of the day
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.780]   and you think, "Really, what did I accomplish?"
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.780]   Yes, everybody's dressed mostly and nobody's bleeding,
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:17.260]   but did we really do enough to say we had school today?
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.820]   We're gonna talk about that.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.180]   We are gonna talk about that.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:25.020]   I have about seven questions that people sent in
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.820]   over the last six weeks that we will address.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.700]   And hopefully we will do another episode
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.100]   of Ask Lisa sometime soon.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.620]   But I also hope to do a round table discussion
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.580]   of moms and fellow homeschoolers,
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.580]   dads, fellow homeschoolers that will represent
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.580]   all of the stages of our family.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.580]   So there'll be a voice that represents where you are
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.820]   in your homeschool journey,
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.820]   not just a voice that represents where you will be
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.100]   in five or 10 years or where you were
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.940]   three or four years ago.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.220]   So keep listening.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.700]   You guys are an awesome community
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.900]   that is an encouragement to me.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.740]   It encourages me to know that there are moms and dads
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.740]   who are still super eager to be the lead learners
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.300]   and the best educators of their children at home.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.140]   So anyway, let's jump in.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.500]   The very first question that I have came from a mom
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.100]   who has kids two years old, seven years old,
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.620]   and 10 years old.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.660]   Okay, let's pause for a moment.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.140]   Man, those are busy years.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.020]   Those are busy, intense years.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.020]   So mama, let me just say right now,
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.900]   you are doing a noble task.
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.900]   Give yourself some credit for taking up the challenge
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:10.140]   of homeschooling and potty training
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:15.140]   and manners training and preteen years.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.020]   You're doing it for years all at once.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.980]   The Lord is here for you
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.300]   and your community is here for you.
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.020]   Her question, her comment is,
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.860]   "The hardest thing about homeschooling is consistency."
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.420]   She said, "Nothing," well,
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.420]   and she says, "Nothing is consistent except community day."
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.180]   So let's take a step back.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.380]   Everybody take a step back.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.220]   If you're worried or anxious about something,
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.260]   I know I do this, I tend to speak in a hyperbole.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.540]   So she says, "Nothing is consistent
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.100]   except for community day."
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.020]   Mom, I want you to give yourself some credit.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:02.020]   I bet there are other consistencies in your family's life.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.260]   And it's easy to see all the ways
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.900]   that we don't quote unquote measure up.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.460]   And all the things that we feel like are lacking
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.100]   in our parenting or our schooling
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.860]   or the way we structure our days with our students,
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.700]   with our children.
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.660]   But give yourself some credit.
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.660]   She said, "I want to know what to do."
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.460]   So here's the question, should I structure my days?
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.900]   Should my days have lots of structure?
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.500]   Should my days have less structure?
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.980]   Maybe I have so much structure built into my day
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.300]   that there's no way that my family
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.620]   is gonna follow that schedule.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.460]   If you have every 15 minutes
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:54.460]   or even every 30 minutes of your day planned out,
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.780]   I's dotted, T's crossed,
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.100]   that's gonna be tough with a two-year-old, right?
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.860]   That's gonna be tough with a seven-year-old.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.100]   It may be tough with a 10-year-old
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.900]   depending on the personalities
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.940]   and needs of your specific children.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.500]   And here's the truth,
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.820]   the personality and needs of you yourself.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.820]   And maybe you are not one who does well
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.900]   with same old, same old.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.620]   Maybe routine is just your fast track
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.660]   to I'm over it or I'm bored
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.780]   or I feel trapped.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:40.580]   Maybe one of your children needs to mix it up.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:45.580]   Maybe what you need is a rhythm
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.100]   instead of a schedule.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.700]   The first thing I think that you probably need to do
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.580]   is take an honest look
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.660]   at your family's biological rhythms.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.820]   Are you early risers or late risers?
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.060]   What is your spouse's work schedule like?
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.500]   Do they work nights?
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.060]   Do they work second shift?
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.060]   Do they work a typical Monday through Friday
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.580]   during the day?
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.580]   Does your family travel a lot?
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.700]   Do you have older family members who live with you
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.460]   who require care or a different schedule
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.820]   from your children and you?
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.380]   Those are some things to think about.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:35.380]   I think that most children do well
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.020]   when they know what to expect.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.820]   That's not the same thing as having every 15 minute,
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.820]   every 30 minute hard block schedule.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.980]   But when children know what to expect,
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.900]   when I get up in the morning, we always,
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.580]   and this is just as a for instance,
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.620]   when I get up in the morning,
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.780]   I always snuggle in bed with my mom.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.220]   I always read a book and then get up
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.540]   and get dressed and make my bed and have breakfast.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.700]   Always after breakfast,
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.740]   and see there are no times associated with this, okay?
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.700]   After breakfast, we always clear the table
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.020]   and snug up on the couch and we read our Bible
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:32.020]   and we read a story and we say our Bible verse, you know?
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:37.220]   After our read aloud time, we do math together.
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.580]   And maybe that is you play math games.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.260]   Maybe that is you use pattern blocks.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.260]   Maybe you use, you go through the math map booklet
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.180]   with your two older children
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.660]   while your little one plays with blocks
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.020]   or shape sorters beside of you.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:06.060]   Maybe after math time, we always go outside
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:11.060]   or maybe every Tuesday after math, we go to the library.
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:17.580]   We have lunch and after lunch, I work on memory work
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.100]   or if you have an older child,
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:27.100]   I work with my mom on essentials or I have reading time.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:35.860]   If your child, if you and your child know the rhythm,
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.700]   then everybody knows what to expect.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.420]   It's not so rigid as in every 15 minute,
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.180]   every 30 minute schedule,
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.880]   but it gives you enough structure
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.500]   that you can fit all the big pieces
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.460]   that are important to your family in
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.380]   and everybody knows what to expect.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:07.820]   In Scribblers, we offer the idea of arranging your day
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:16.580]   around the Scribblers verbs.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.200]   For families with young children,
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.600]   what you want to be sure that you do
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.680]   is be together every day,
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:32.540]   piquing their curiosity, chasing down wonder,
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.400]   reading and talking as a family.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.400]   And if you can get to the end of the day, we say,
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   and you have prayed together, played together,
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.340]   read together, explored together and served together,
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:56.380]   it has been a good day.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:01.380]   And so you could arrange the rhythm of your day
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.700]   around the Scribblers verbs.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.520]   Every day, you need to pray together.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.380]   You need to have a devotion, a spiritual time.
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.920]   Maybe you will sing a hymn.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.120]   Maybe you will memorize scripture verses together.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.860]   You need to pray together.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.940]   You need to play together.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.920]   Play is the work of childhood.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.580]   That is actually how children learn best
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.900]   while they are having fun, while they are doing something.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.680]   And most children like to be active when they play.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.380]   So play blocks with your children.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.980]   But as you build, maybe you are creating patterns.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.580]   Maybe you are naming squares and circles
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.400]   and rectangles and triangles.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.720]   And maybe you'll discover
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.780]   that when you put two triangles together,
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.600]   you can make a square.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.660]   Or when you put a bunch of triangles together,
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.520]   you can make a different shape.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.520]   So you play together, read together every day,
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.400]   read all kinds of things together.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   That will allow your children to see the beauty of words
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:14.620]   in stories and short books and poems
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:19.780]   and song lyrics, all kinds of reading.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.900]   Read together every day and help your little children
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.100]   begin to learn how to read
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.580]   so that they can read by themselves as well.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.940]   So read together every day.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.260]   Explore together every day.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.580]   You might explore a topic that you've read about.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.260]   You might explore your backyard.
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:48.260]   You might explore what different baking ingredients do
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260]   when you cook in the kitchen.
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:55.260]   You might explore a science museum in your town.
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.020]   You might explore the heavens at night
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.580]   as you look at the stars.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.820]   Let your child be the guide.
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.580]   Let the foundation's memory work be the guide.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.580]   Explore more deeply some of the people or places
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.660]   or organisms that you encounter in the memory work,
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.180]   but explore something every day
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.700]   and then serve together every day.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.060]   Most of us have chosen to homeschool our children
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.580]   because we want to raise them in the nurture
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.480]   and admonition of the Lord.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:34.480]   We want them to have hearts full of mercy
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.140]   and love and kindness.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.980]   And one of the best ways to teach our children
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.620]   to be good citizens of the world
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.420]   and good citizens of heaven
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.140]   is to teach them to be kind to one another
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.180]   and to serve one another.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.900]   And it begins at home.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.900]   So even your two-year-old can serve his or her brothers
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.220]   and sisters.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.660]   And as your children get older,
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.620]   you go farther outside of your home
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.880]   to serve your neighborhood and your church family
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.180]   and your extended family in your town
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.860]   and maybe your state.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.300]   And I know lots of families
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.020]   who as their children approach the teenage years,
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.540]   do family mission trips together, even overseas.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:24.260]   So you could have the rhythm of your day
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.820]   based around the Scribbler's Verbs.
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:35.500]   Think about the first thing to do
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.060]   is to think about what it is
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:45.060]   that you are trying to do with your homeschool.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.260]   What are you trying to teach your children?
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.540]   What is important to you as a family?
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.240]   And then everything you do should serve that purpose.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.780]   I think that probably consistency
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.620]   has a different definition for all of us,
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.580]   but I suspect, Mom, that what you're looking for
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.400]   is something that you and your children
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.660]   can come to rely on,
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.660]   something that is reassuring in its rhythm.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.220]   So decide what are the important aspects
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:28.220]   of homeschooling for you every year,
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.540]   every month, every week,
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.180]   and then work back into the everyday.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.460]   And maybe the way to consistency for you
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.160]   is not a schedule, but a rhythm.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.180]   All right.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.360]   Next question.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.060]   This was an interesting question to me.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:55.740]   How many CC families supplement
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:00.420]   language arts and math in the Foundations years?
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:06.620]   Well, I can remember when I began as a practicum speaker
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.380]   almost 20 years ago.
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.740]   I remember telling people,
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.620]   Foundations is wonderfully amazing.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.260]   It is so illuminating.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.900]   You and your children are gonna explore the world
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.820]   through the Foundations memory work.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.820]   It is absolutely mind-boggling
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.940]   the amount of stuff that you're gonna know.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.340]   But you still need,
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.760]   in addition to the Foundations memory work,
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.760]   a language arts or a learn-to-read program
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:46.020]   and a practice math computation program.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.140]   And people will say, "What's the best one?
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.580]   "What's the best one for my family?"
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.620]   That, my friends, I can not answer for you
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.620]   because the answer for both of those
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.700]   is the one that you and your family will do regularly,
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:08.780]   that you will hold onto.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.460]   Because both learning to read
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:17.460]   and learning to be fast with your math facts
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.920]   is dependent on everyday practice.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.760]   So you need a reading program, moms and dads,
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.140]   that you can handle, that you can figure out,
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.740]   that you can and will happily use,
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.280]   and that fits the learning style of your child.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.860]   And you need a math program
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.940]   that won't prompt everybody to tears or mutiny
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.900]   because to become proficient in mathematics,
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.180]   in arithmetic especially,
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.900]   what you need is everyday practice and familiarity.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:58.380]   You need to get super over-familiar
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.980]   with some of the math facts
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.260]   and with how to add and subtract and multiply and divide
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.420]   and recognize shapes and time and money
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.500]   and that kind of thing.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.260]   So from my experience,
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:18.140]   every CC family supplements the language arts
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:23.140]   and the math curriculum in the foundations years.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.860]   There are lots of programs out there.
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.860]   I will tell you that a phonics-based reading curriculum
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.460]   has been proven to be the best
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.580]   for students who are learning to read.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.140]   That is a very classical way to read.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.380]   And if you get a hold of the Scribblers curriculum,
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.940]   which is designed for students
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.740]   that are three to eight years old,
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:55.860]   there is an entire section with phonics games
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.560]   and activities and learning to read activities.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.560]   So it's very important that you and your beginning readers
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.460]   have a learning to read program.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.660]   There is of course more to reading
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.740]   than just learning to decode sounds and letters.
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.200]   You want to teach your children to read for pleasure
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.580]   and to read for information.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.140]   So reading comprehension is also something
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.700]   that you want to practice.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.980]   Most of the reading programs that you will find
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.420]   will help you, will encourage you in that desire.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:43.060]   But I will tell you also that just reading aloud as a family
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:48.060]   will fan the flames of reading comprehension
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.740]   and interest in the written word.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.420]   So far as math goes, you really, really need to find
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.260]   a math program that you guys will do
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.540]   fairly happily, very routinely.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.900]   The Math Map is awesome.
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.820]   You can look on CC Connected and get examples
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.280]   from the Math Map, Young Ages.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.420]   This is a very classical curriculum
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:21.380]   where children become familiar with shapes
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:26.220]   and vocabulary and content before they are asked
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.700]   to manipulate numbers and concepts.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.820]   It is very classical, it's very different.
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.860]   It is very conversation-based.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:39.300]   And for me, the best teaching that you will do
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.980]   with your little children involves you as the mentor
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.420]   and them as the learner.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.740]   And believe me, as they get older,
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.020]   sometimes those roles flip and they become the mentor
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.540]   and you become the learner as they move
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.900]   through middle and high school.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:01.900]   But classical learning is all about the give and take.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.860]   It is all about a conversation and exploring together.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.580]   So find a reading program and find a mathematic
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.340]   and arithmetic program that you and your children
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.460]   will enjoy together.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:20.180]   All right, next question.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.220]   This question is very interesting to me.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:32.220]   This is a challenge family, a family who said,
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:37.500]   what do you do, how do you handle challenge discussions
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.500]   with families that are uncomfortable with parts of history?
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:48.700]   Now, I really wish that I had the questioner here
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.420]   so I could ask some clarifying questions.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:56.380]   I'm wondering, are these discussions at home
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.020]   or in community?
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:03.020]   I am suspecting that we're talking about conversations
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:09.860]   and discussions within the Challenge Day community
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:16.740]   for families that are uncomfortable with parts of history.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.100]   Now, I'm not sure, I'm making assumptions again
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.660]   on which parts of history
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.220]   the family might be uncomfortable with.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.580]   But here's what I would have,
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.260]   here's what I have to say in a general way.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:39.260]   These are challenge discussions and the most,
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:44.380]   the absolute most beautiful part of the challenge program
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.780]   for my family was that my girls learned
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:55.980]   how to explore ideas and different positions
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:03.300]   on issues respectfully, thoughtfully,
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:13.340]   offering mercy and grace to their classmates
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.620]   who had different perspectives.
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:21.620]   They learned how to listen twice as long as they spoke.
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:28.580]   They learned how to keep asking clarifying questions
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:33.580]   till they got to the kernel of difference
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.700]   when they were discussing, when they were coming at an issue
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.960]   and arriving at two different conclusions.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.260]   Challenge communities are beautiful places
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:52.260]   where our students are taught
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:58.780]   to love their neighbor well
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.380]   by listening and trying to understand.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:07.740]   There are very few issues that are off limits for discussion
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:13.740]   but every opinion that is voiced
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.740]   is worth examining and discovering truth.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:26.360]   And so I think that the first thing,
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:32.820]   if my family was uncomfortable with a way
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.820]   that a piece of history was being presented in class,
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.820]   I think that I would talk to the director
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.660]   and make sure I would talk to my student first
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:50.660]   and say, are all sides of the issue being brought forward?
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.340]   Are all sides being presented?
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.140]   And if my student said, well, no,
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.340]   everybody seems to think this one way
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.340]   and it's not my way, but that's the only position
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.100]   that is being brought forward,
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.180]   then I would have to say to my student, let's pray
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.540]   and think, let's pray through this
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.820]   and let me help you figure out ways
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:20.700]   to bring the other position, the opposing position
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.460]   or a different viewpoint, or at the very least,
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.620]   some clarifying questions that could be put forward
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.620]   to help us all look at an issue in the broader sense.
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:41.060]   Realizing that there might be another side to this issue
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:46.060]   or that these events might have had,
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:52.980]   it might look different from somebody else's perspective
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.500]   or from the other side.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.980]   So I think I would talk to my student
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.020]   and I would also talk to the director.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.620]   I would want to know what is it
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.160]   that's bringing the discomfort?
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   Is it that one side is being ignored
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:17.060]   or is it that one person
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.060]   or one group's position is being shunned or belittled?
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.980]   That's hard for me to imagine,
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:29.020]   but that should not happen in the challenge communities.
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:36.580]   I think exploring and sharing and researching and thinking.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:41.680]   The beauty of classical conversations
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   is that our students are taught to examine an issue
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:51.200]   from all sides and in its totality,
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   even things that are uncomfortable.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.160]   Here's the truth.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.000]   The Lord does not want us to be ignorant
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.320]   and God is big enough for all of our questions.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   As long as we are looking for God to show us,
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.240]   to give us light and illumination,
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.720]   I think that there is very little
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.080]   that our challenge students can't explore together.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:22.420]   I think that CC wants our students
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:30.080]   to examine all sides of all issues
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:35.920]   so that our students have practice thinking well,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.680]   reasoning their way to truth,
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:44.680]   not just appropriating what their family has always believed
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.600]   or what the loudest voice in a group is saying
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.800]   or the most persuasive person.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.240]   There needs to be room for all questions
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.320]   to be searched out and researched and thought about
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.680]   and weighed and logically examined.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:07.680]   And there is respect for all earnest seekers
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:13.360]   within our classical conversations communities.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.840]   So bottom line, first line is to talk to your student.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.280]   Is it uncomfortable because you're ignored
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.420]   or because you don't know how to bring up your disagreement?
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.080]   And then talk to the director.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.080]   How can we foster a true questioning, weighing,
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:37.480]   looking at all the options atmosphere for our students?
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.640]   All right, somebody wrote in and said,
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.760]   okay, how do I deal with this?
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:48.760]   CC looks absolutely amazing, but it's so unfamiliar.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:54.320]   How do I take the leap in faith?
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.280]   You know what?
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.240]   That is a question that everybody has,
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.840]   that everybody has had.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.640]   We've all gone to an information meeting
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.960]   or almost all of us have gone to an information meeting
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.940]   or we've listened to a friend wax eloquent
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.680]   about how great CC is and it does sound great
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.560]   and it looks amazing on paper.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.600]   And if you ever go to a practicum
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.760]   and listen to a panel of challenge students,
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.580]   you just think, I don't know what Kool-Aid
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.720]   they have been drinking, but I would like to buy some
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.500]   and give it to my children every day
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.640]   for the rest of their lives.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.880]   I want my children to be able to speak well
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:38.400]   and think well and answer well and enjoy learning
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.420]   and enjoy talking to people about what they're learning.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.800]   So yes, it does sound amazing.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.600]   How do you screw your courage up to do it?
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.960]   You just have to leap.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.440]   You just have to try it.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.080]   Here's, I wanna go back to one thing that I said earlier.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.900]   The first thing to me,
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:03.120]   when you are trying to decide what to do
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.480]   with these awesome, beautiful humans
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.920]   that the Lord has given you, your children,
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:14.760]   you have to prayerfully consider
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.760]   what is it that we as a family believe about the Lord?
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.280]   What is it that we believe about our children individually?
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.880]   What do we believe is God's mission for our family?
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.400]   What do we believe about the position of education
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.400]   as it impacts our family and our family's mission?
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:44.440]   You have to know those things in order to start well.
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:50.780]   Because sometimes once you get started,
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.060]   things are gonna be hard.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.500]   And if you don't know why you started,
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:59.300]   and if you're not sure that this was a good, right path
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.100]   that the Lord had led you to,
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.460]   you're gonna be tempted to quit.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.700]   Not just quit classical conversations
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.380]   or classical education.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.260]   You're gonna be tempted to quit whatever you start,
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.540]   whatever kind of homeschooling you start,
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.460]   or even homeschooling because it is going to get hard.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:21.460]   And on hard days, you need more to fall back on
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.420]   than I thought this was gonna be fun,
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.260]   or I thought this was gonna be easy,
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.420]   or I thought this would be more convenient
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.300]   than sending them to school.
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:40.200]   You will find 50 ways to second guess yourself on that
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.340]   the first month that you're homeschooling.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.860]   All of that stuff.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:48.500]   But if you believe that God gave you your children
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.660]   and He is calling you to raise them
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.300]   and educate them at home
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.540]   so that you can make sure that your child
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.940]   knows the Lord deeply,
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:06.940]   and that He sees this world that the Lord created
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:12.100]   and understands how beautiful and good it is,
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:16.660]   and how intricately it fits together,
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.820]   and how the Lord is calling them
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.540]   to be a steward of His Word
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.940]   and a steward of His world,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   if you are convinced that this classical education
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.760]   is the way God's calling you to raise your children,
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.660]   then even when the day gets hard or long
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.220]   or discouraging or frustrating,
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:45.500]   you'll keep going because you will know
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.540]   that you are marching toward the goal
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.200]   that God called you to.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.980]   It is amazing.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.820]   CC is amazing.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.140]   And it is, for most of us,
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:01.720]   it was very unfamiliar when we started.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.940]   The whole idea of memorizing so much material
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.860]   when they're young is not something
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.240]   that most of us grew up doing.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.180]   I will tell you from experience,
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.620]   it is a blessing beyond all reason.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:22.900]   My children memorized and memorized and memorized,
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.540]   but then as they got older,
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.420]   they had so much good stuff to think about
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.700]   and to put together in ways that helped them
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.980]   understand the world that God had created
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.520]   and that He was calling them to participate in.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.640]   All of the emphasis on public speaking
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.340]   is very off-putting to some of us
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.960]   who never had to do that when we were little
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.660]   or older and don't like to do it now.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.740]   And we've got four and five-year-olds
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.860]   who stand up and give a presentation every week.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.700]   Listen, it is a blessing beyond compare
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.300]   to raise a child who knows how to think,
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.160]   who knows how to organize their thoughts
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.180]   so that they can communicate persuasively
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:17.140]   and in an interesting and natural way
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:22.140]   with somebody else on almost any topic that you hand them.
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.620]   It is a beautiful equipping thing.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.120]   One thing I would ask for you,
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.420]   and when you're trying to decide,
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.700]   this is so new and it's so different.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.100]   Can I even do this?
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.020]   Think about for yourself,
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.220]   how do you approach most new things?
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:44.540]   How do you get used to the new thing?
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.020]   Do you need a buddy to walk arm in arm with you
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.780]   and pull you forward or push you from behind
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:52.820]   when the going gets rough
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.860]   or just be there to experience it with you?
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.580]   That's what community is all about.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.340]   Join a classical conversations community.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.860]   You will have a room full of buddies
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.140]   who are walking the same path
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.380]   and sometimes stumbling over the same ruts,
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:15.380]   but sometimes leaping over the same hedges that you are.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:21.120]   Homeschooling with a friend is so much better
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.100]   than going it alone,
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:27.660]   no matter what method of homeschooling you take.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.660]   Community is a blessing.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:35.020]   Find a community and dive in,
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.540]   but make the commitment that you're going to stick with it.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.740]   You need to stick with it long enough
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.500]   to begin to see the fruit.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.940]   It might be very different
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.820]   from what your children are used to doing too.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.300]   And some kids love it right away
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.180]   and some kids are a little slower to warm up
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.220]   because it is so different.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:00.700]   But every child loves time with his family.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.220]   Every child loves time with his parent.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.860]   And if you will pour into your child
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:11.860]   and use the classical conversations curriculum
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:16.900]   as a springboard to deeper conversations,
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.940]   not only will your child grow,
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:23.280]   but your family relationships will grow as well.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:28.140]   All right.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:32.260]   This is an interesting question from a challenge mom.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:37.260]   She said, "My teenagers always finish their work early.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:42.340]   How can I fill their time?
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:45.480]   What do I need to add to fill their time?"
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.400]   Now, I have to tell you the truth.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.020]   This flabbergasted me when I read it.
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:53.860]   My kids did not always finish early.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.980]   It didn't take them forever in a hundred years,
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:01.660]   but they were not early finishers necessarily
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.220]   of the challenge material.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.560]   Here are a couple of things that I have to suggest.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:12.740]   In the challenge guides,
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.320]   there's a range of work.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.940]   They're the things that you are expected to do every week
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:24.520]   so that you are prepared to participate
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.360]   in class discussions.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.980]   And then there are extra,
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.440]   there's like the extra mile you could go.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.560]   There are, for instance, in American documents,
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.880]   there are documents that you're supposed to annotate
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.320]   each week so that you can have a true discussion
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.880]   with your classmates when you come to class.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.760]   Everybody's read the same thing.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.280]   Everybody's kind of chewed it up and digested it.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.240]   We've got something to talk about.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.020]   But there are always additional documents
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:59.840]   that you can work on with your student at home
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.340]   if your student is finishing earlier.
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.720]   Things that will help them see maybe even more
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.800]   of the fabric of the founding fathers
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.000]   and the founding American documents.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.920]   So there's usually more that you can do.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.360]   You can encourage your teenager to review.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.480]   I know no teenager that I know likes to review,
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:28.480]   but just like intensity, duration over time
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.560]   is what brings mastery in memorization.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.280]   It's what brings mastery and understanding
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.840]   of more complicated concepts as well.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.840]   So help your kids to not despise going back to review
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:49.400]   and seeing if they can find new connections
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:53.160]   between what they talked about and read about
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.040]   and studied last week and what they're learning this week.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.520]   Another thing that your older teenagers
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.040]   or teenagers and older students can do
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.720]   is help their younger brothers and sisters
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.760]   and help review foundations with the younger kids.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.960]   One of the coolest things that I have noted
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:15.400]   is that when I had my older daughter
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.800]   review with my younger daughter,
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.520]   I would sometimes overhear her say,
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.200]   oh, be sure you've got this.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.120]   Be sure you do that Latin memory work.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:29.040]   Man, you're gonna have a much easier time with Latin
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.040]   if you get these endings down now.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.800]   Or they will be reviewing history sentences and say,
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.200]   oh my gosh, you're gonna learn more about this.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.360]   Let me show it to you on this map.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.760]   Look how close this country is to this country.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.400]   Here's how they're related.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.720]   And they begin to share and they begin to become rhetorical
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.960]   with some of the information
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.440]   that they themselves have studied.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.160]   That's a lot of fun too.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.160]   You may, your student may be ready to consider CC+
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.640]   that what we used to call dual enrollment
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.000]   is concurrent enrollment.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   They may be able with a few tweaks to their CC curriculum,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.680]   be able to get college credit for some of the work
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.720]   that they are doing in their challenge classes.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.440]   CC+ would be a great thing
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:25.480]   for these Finnish early teens to look into.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:30.680]   But you know what, do you know what you could do?
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:35.680]   You could encourage your teenager to find a hobby,
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:41.240]   a new hobby, a new skill that they would like to practice,
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.600]   to get better at, to explore.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.920]   Something that they've always been interested in
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.920]   that never makes it into your curriculum for the year.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.480]   Let them do some reading.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.400]   Let them do some volunteer work.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.400]   Let them go work at a science center or an observatory
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:11.160]   or a hospital or a retirement center or a farm.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:18.960]   Let your child get some real life hands-on work experience
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:26.240]   to go along with their thinking, their pondering,
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.040]   their philosophizing, their big ideas
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   that they do in class and at home and by themselves.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.440]   Give your child time to volunteer,
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.400]   help them add an interest or get a job.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.040]   These are all good things to do with your teenagers
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.560]   who are finishing early.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.120]   (mouse clicks)
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.440]   All right.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:57.120]   And my last question, how do we know?
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.320]   Somebody has asked this,
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:02.600]   and this is actually one of the easiest questions to answer,
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.360]   but it is something that we all want to know.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:11.360]   This question is, how do I know what else to buy
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.480]   besides a foundations guide?
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:20.480]   Besides a foundation, when you go to a book fair,
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.440]   there's a bajillion good things,
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.920]   and you just think, what is it that I need to buy?
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.480]   Or when you go to a classical conversations
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:34.480]   information meeting and you come home absolutely jazzed up
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.040]   and you've signed up and you're so excited
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.960]   about this new adventure you're gonna have,
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:43.440]   and then you think, but what do I need to get started?
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.040]   Everybody just talks about stick in the sand
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.040]   and come to community and memorize the timeline,
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.760]   but surely I need books, what do I need?
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.280]   How do I know what else I need to buy?
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:01.120]   Here is the best resource that a CC parent can have.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.000]   It's the catalog, this classical conversations catalog,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.040]   and you can get that sent to your home.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.680]   In the catalog, there is an insert
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.880]   in the middle of the catalog.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.640]   This year, it is between page 82 and page 83,
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:23.920]   and it calls it a program shopping list,
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.080]   but I like to think of it as a resource.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:33.080]   It is arranged by program,
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:38.080]   so there is a list for the foundations community,
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:42.920]   for scribblers at home, for the essentials community,
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   and every level of challenge from A to four,
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:54.720]   and even some resources for the CC plus college credit
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:59.520]   for challenge program that I was telling you about.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.880]   So this person is specifically asking,
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:04.520]   what else do I buy for foundation?
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:09.520]   So on this page, between page 82 and 83 in the catalog,
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:13.360]   it tells you that highlighted resources,
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.680]   so they are highlighted in gray,
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.040]   highlighted resources are required,
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.760]   and the non-highlighted resources are just recommended.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.480]   So highlighted is what you have to have
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.720]   in order to really do the program at home,
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.480]   and the non-highlighted ones are resources
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.480]   that will help you explore more or in a different way.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:48.480]   So it's divided into categories.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.240]   First thing, so Cultivating Classical Leaders.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:57.240]   These are awesome books for parents of foundation students
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:02.160]   or parents who are just beginning with classical education
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.920]   to grab a hold of.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:08.080]   Things like "Classical Christian Education Made Approachable"
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.680]   is a really short book.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.440]   It is really, really easy reading.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   You can read it in one sitting.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.200]   It'll take you about an hour and a half, two hours to read.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.520]   It gives you a great blueprint
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.720]   of a classical Christian education
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.120]   and how you can do this at home.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.120]   Then there are other books
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.680]   like "How to Develop a Brilliant Memory,"
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.560]   books that parents might want to read in their downtime,
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.240]   but then it tells you what you'll need in community.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.800]   There are two resources highlighted,
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.080]   and then memory work flashcards are just recommended.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.560]   These are things that you could use
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.760]   to practice your memory work,
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.000]   or you can make your own flashcards.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.720]   So the highlighted resources
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.920]   are the things that you have to have,
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.160]   and the unhighlighted resources
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:05.160]   are the things that you could use to explore more
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:09.120]   or to support your program in a different way.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.680]   So it goes through all of our strands.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.000]   So the logic strand, that's your math,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   that's what you would need,
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.840]   and none of those on the foundation's community list,
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.200]   none of those resources are highlighted
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.600]   because you do not have to purchase any of those
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   in order to be part of a foundation's community.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.000]   But remember early on,
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.600]   we said everybody needs a math curriculum,
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.200]   a math program that they're gonna work.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.600]   So in that section,
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.360]   there are some great suggestions
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.760]   for families to use to do math at home.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.880]   Then there's a research section.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.040]   This is kind of like our science stuff,
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.880]   the explorations.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.800]   The only thing highlighted in there
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:03.680]   is 201 Awesome, Magical, Bizarre,
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.920]   and Incredible Experiments.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.560]   This is a fun book that you and your kids can use
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.440]   as the basis for how you're gonna explore
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.440]   God's world together at home.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.520]   There are other resources there that are recommended.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.200]   They're not required.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.800]   Things like the Acts and Facts Science Cards,
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.280]   which have beautiful artwork,
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.160]   beautiful pictures on the front,
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.920]   and more information that will allow you
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.520]   to explore with your child on the back.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.720]   There are books like Lyrical Life Science,
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:41.920]   different volumes of lyrical life science.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.360]   It comes with a CD.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.240]   These are, this is memory work,
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.200]   information set to music,
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.840]   all different types of music.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.240]   If you're a musical family
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.880]   or your child is an auditory learner,
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:59.280]   this would be a fun way to learn about mammals
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   or ecology or the human body,
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:05.240]   but it's recommended, not required.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.200]   And then there are some readers
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:10.720]   that are delightful for that morning read aloud time
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.560]   that we talked about earlier
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:16.120]   called Exploring the Heavens with Uncle Paul.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.280]   And some of those resources,
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:22.040]   the Science Cards, the Lyrical Life Science,
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:26.200]   the Exploring with Uncle Paul,
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:29.720]   those are listed by cycle.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:33.280]   So in Foundations, we have three cycles
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.520]   that repeat over and over and over again.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.520]   This coming fall, we will be in cycle two.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.960]   So in the catalog, in this year's catalog,
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.040]   when you see, for instance,
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:50.760]   all three of the Exploring with Uncle Paul books listed,
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.920]   the cycle two is bolded
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.840]   so that you will know that's the reader
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.240]   or the book or the set of cards
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.720]   that is most closely aligned
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.080]   with the cycle we're going into this fall.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   So only one required in the Research section,
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.200]   but a lot of recommended
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.680]   and the ones that will most closely follow
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.400]   the upcoming cycle are bolded.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:25.920]   There's a Reasoning strand.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.640]   This has things like art and music, all right?
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.720]   So the highlighted resources for reasoning
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.960]   include Discovering Great Artists,
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:40.440]   Drawing with Children, and Classical Music for Dummies.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   So our children in Foundations will do Music Theory,
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.160]   Ten Whistles, and Music Practice,
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:52.600]   and Art as part of their Foundations years.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.680]   And so those are the resources
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:59.040]   that parents will want to have at home.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.160]   And then there are some other,
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.120]   there are Artists, Acts and Facts,
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.640]   Artists and Composer cards also
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:08.920]   that are recommended that you can use.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:13.920]   And the Set 2 will align most closely with Cycle 2,
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.640]   so that's bolded, okay?
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.480]   There are other resources
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:23.280]   that you might love to have at home
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.080]   that your child might enjoy
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.320]   that have to do with Geography.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:32.320]   There are Trivium Tables, Geography.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.920]   There are Placements for Geography.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.200]   These are fun things to have,
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:43.280]   not required, just extras.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   In that same Debate section
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.680]   of the Foundations Community List,
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:53.160]   you'll see the Classical Acts and Facts History cards.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.760]   These are beautiful.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.360]   And I will tell you,
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:01.360]   this is the resource outside of the Foundations curriculum
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:07.720]   and the 10 Whistle that most families purchase.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:11.640]   The Classical Acts and Facts cards
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.840]   align with the timeline
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.800]   that children memorize in Foundations.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.880]   They are beautiful cards,
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:22.640]   a gorgeous piece of artwork reproduced on the front,
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:27.000]   and a very informative backside
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.320]   that has a map and a timeline
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:34.040]   and paragraphs of information
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.640]   that you and your child can explore together.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.840]   And those are the Classical Acts and Facts History cards
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.120]   that are referenced from Scribblers
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.880]   all the way through Challenge.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:49.000]   So this is not a resource
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.200]   that you're gonna be done with right away,
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.600]   or in one year, or even in six years.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:58.760]   You're going to use it all the way through high school, okay?
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:03.360]   There are other really great readers
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.800]   listed on the Foundations Community page
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.200]   that you will want to look at.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.760]   We have Senators of Rome,
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.400]   Emperors of Rome, Kings of Rome.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.200]   And then there are readers
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.360]   that are great for morning time.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:23.240]   And the one that most closely aligns with Cycle Two
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.880]   is highlighted there under the Grammar section.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:30.920]   And for Exposition, our beautiful
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.840]   Echoes Storybook Readers.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.560]   These have got stories
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.840]   and fables and poems
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:44.240]   from all around the world and all across time.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.440]   These are beautiful books, beautiful stories
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.840]   with really great illustrations.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:53.880]   Old World Echoes is the Cycle Two specific.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.600]   It goes most closely with Cycle Two.
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.920]   So that one is bolded on your Foundations Community page.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.800]   They're in the catalog between page 82 and 83
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.160]   of the 2025 catalog.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.120]   So that's how you know what else to buy.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.640]   Now, another way that you can explore
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.960]   which of those recommended resources
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.440]   you might really receive the most benefit from,
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.920]   ask another family member, ask somebody in your community.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.440]   Have you used this resource?
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.040]   What did you guys do with it?
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.480]   How helpful was it?
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.320]   What did you love about it?
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.960]   Which resource sat on the shelf
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.240]   and which resource did you use the most?
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.800]   And how did you use it and why did you love it?
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.800]   I've gotten really great ideas from friends
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.560]   who it turned out were using, say, the timeline cards
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.040]   in ways I had never thought of before.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.440]   And so that availing yourself
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.840]   of the experience of your community
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.160]   will give you even more reasons
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.840]   to value some of these recommended resources, okay?
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:11.120]   As always, your director is also an invaluable resource
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.240]   for determining how your family
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.880]   can get the very most out of the program, okay?
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.840]   Guys, I have enjoyed talking to you so very much today
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.680]   and answering some of your questions.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.160]   I hope that you will feel free
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.200]   to send more questions another time
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.200]   and we'll do another Ask Lisa and ask other people too.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.600]   How about that?
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.080]   As we go, I want you to know
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.560]   that we have great things coming up in the spring
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.040]   and all through the year with Everyday Educator
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.880]   and with Classical Conversations.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.000]   You might even wanna go ahead and mark your calendar
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.040]   for our National Events Weekend.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.680]   It's coming up in May,
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.960]   May 2nd through the 4th in Southern Pines.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.840]   And so you look,
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.760]   some of the major events will be National Conference,
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.120]   National Commencement,
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.880]   and the National Memory Master Championship.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.400]   So make your plans,
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.680]   go to classicalconversations.com
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.960]   and you can find more information
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.800]   about our National Events Weekend.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.520]   I'll look for you there.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.960]   Thanks, and I'll see you next time.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.620]   you
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:41.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
