[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.620]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.500]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.620]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and today we have something
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.040]   a little different in store for you,
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   and I think it's pretty awesome.
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.320]   So it all started when I thought about doing an episode
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.440]   about how to optimize the entire home buying experience.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.540]   And I mean all of it, agents, listings, diligence,
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.380]   inspections, financing, offers, and everything in between.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.780]   So while I've gone through this process twice,
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.100]   I wanted to make sure we had it all covered,
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.180]   including what you might do differently in today's market.
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.220]   So I reached out to David Green and Rob Abasolo,
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.260]   who hosts the number one real estate podcast out there,
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.740]   Bigger Pockets Real Estate,
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.540]   which I've listened to on so many occasions.
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.700]   They are 10 times more knowledgeable than I am in the space.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.180]   David is a real estate investor
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.020]   with over a decade of experience.
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.340]   He's bought, rehabbed, and managed more than 50 properties.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.380]   He runs an award-winning mortgage company
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.220]   and a top-producing real estate agent team.
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.020]   Rob is also a real estate investor
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.700]   and a 12-time Airbnb super host
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700]   who is often called the king of short-term rentals.
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.820]   Between the three of us, we should leave no hack unturned,
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.460]   but please reach out to me if we do
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.420]   so I can make sure to share it on an upcoming episode.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.660]   And one more thing.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.580]   This episode isn't just coming out on all the hacks,
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880]   but we broke it down into a three-part series
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.860]   on the Bigger Pockets feed as well,
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.140]   which is helpful context
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.340]   for the way we interact on this episode.
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.900]   And while you might not need to listen
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.260]   to the conversation twice,
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.220]   you should definitely check out their show.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.780]   It is so fantastic.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.380]   And with hundreds of episodes,
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.740]   I think they've covered just about every aspect
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.260]   of real estate possible,
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.580]   from buying, to investing, to house hacking,
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.020]   to short-term rentals, and a lot more.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.540]   We'll make sure to mention a few relevant episodes today
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.500]   and link to them in the show notes as well,
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.940]   or you can just search wherever you're listening to this
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.700]   for Bigger Pockets Real Estate.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.320]   But without further ado,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.540]   let's jump into today's conversation right after this.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.540]   I wish I could say I'm eating a fully balanced diet
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.860]   every day, but the reality is that I'm not.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.100]   So I love having an easy way
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.300]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.020]   which is why I always kickstart my day with AG1,
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.940]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.220]   AG1 has been in my routine for over a year
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.960]   because just one daily serving
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.980]   gives me the comprehensive foundational nutrition I need
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.820]   and supports energy, focus, strength, and clarity
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.620]   with 75 high-quality vitamins, probiotics,
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.460]   and whole food sourced ingredients.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.540]   So it can completely replace your multivitamin,
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.100]   probiotics, and more.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.940]   Every morning, I mix it up with some water,
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.600]   add a few ice cubes because it's so good cold,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.360]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.880]   and energized for the day,
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.260]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.580]   I also love that AG1 is raising the standard
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.640]   for quality in the supplement category
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.420]   with less than one gram of sugar, no GMOs,
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.160]   no nasty chemicals or artificial anything.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.540]   So if you're looking for a simpler,
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.460]   effective investment in your health,
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.140]   try AG1 and get five free AG1 travel packs
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.540]   and a free one-year supply of vitamin D
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.060]   with your first purchase.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.580]   Go to allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.580]   That's allthehacks.com/AG and the number one.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.220]   How the turntables have turned.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.180]   Chris, welcome to our show,
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.540]   and I will just go ahead and welcome myself to your show
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.780]   to save you the time there.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.920]   We've got a cool little crossover event going on here today.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.980]   For those who are unfamiliar, my name is David Green.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.000]   I'm a former police officer who became a real estate investor
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.480]   and is now a real estate broker.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   I have a mortgage company called The One Brokerage.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.940]   I run a real estate team.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.280]   I buy rentals, I write books,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.860]   and I host The Bigger Pockets Podcast.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.440]   And I'm Rob Abasolo.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.680]   I am the co-host of The Bigger Pockets Podcast.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.720]   I have a goofy YouTube channel called Rob Built
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.680]   where I teach people how to invest in real estate,
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.400]   short-term rentals, tiny homes,
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.840]   and I'm a former ad man, if you will,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.080]   just like the Mad Men, the TV show is basically me.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.520]   I was a copywriter and I quit all that corporate dreams
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.360]   about two years ago to focus full-time on real estate
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.280]   and documenting the journey.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.380]   So let's jump in.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.480]   Someone wants to buy a house.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.160]   I always tend to ask people,
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.880]   before you're even thinking about this,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.920]   why are you doing this?
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.800]   So I'm curious if you guys have any frameworks you use
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.960]   for thinking about why you would buy a house,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.520]   what's important to you.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.800]   It doesn't even make sense
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.160]   before we jump into optimizing the entire process.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.920]   Well, I mean, there's a lot of reasons
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.180]   to get into real estate.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.760]   I don't think that there's any one particular reason.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.080]   Some people get into real estate accidentally
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.640]   where they buy a house and they live in that house.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.040]   And then one day they decide to buy another house
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   and move into that house.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.120]   And then they have to decide,
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.840]   should they sell or keep the home?
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.680]   And then they become a landlord and then decide,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.240]   oh, hey, the cashflow from this is great.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.600]   And then they buy more houses.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.840]   Some people buy a house and then house hack
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.680]   and rent out rooms and their home to subsidize
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.520]   their mortgage.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.440]   And then there are also the other side of it
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.720]   where people work nine to five jobs
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.400]   and maybe they're not making enough money
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   at that nine to five job
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.560]   and they want to create supplemental income.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.640]   So they get into real estate
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.200]   to help create monthly cashflow,
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.360]   or maybe they just want to eventually replace
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   their nine to five income with real estate.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.400]   So for me, that was really why I got into it.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.720]   I had a pretty stable career in advertising,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.000]   never really felt like I was making enough money.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.680]   And so my side hustle became real estate
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.880]   and I just started buying more properties
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.000]   as a way to make more money to supplement
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.480]   what I didn't feel like I was making at my career.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.320]   What about you, David?
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.160]   What do you think?
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.600]   - You know, there's a lot of practical reasons
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.120]   why you want to invest in real estate.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.640]   Even the casual observer sees home prices
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.440]   getting higher and higher and higher.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.880]   You watch the HGTV shows that show
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.480]   how people can make money in real estate.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.400]   It's kind of understood that it works,
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.040]   but not everyone knows the brass tacks
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.840]   of why you can make money with real estate.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.360]   A lot of it are tax advantages, the tax code.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.360]   It's very forgiving for real estate investors
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.080]   and the money that you make from real estate,
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.960]   you usually pay much less taxes on
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.400]   than if you made that same money at a job
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.440]   because there's a little bit of risk
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.840]   that's going to be involved in it.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.240]   It's easy to leverage,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.160]   meaning I can buy a $500,000 house
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.600]   and put maybe 5% down on the loan.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.440]   So I've only put $25,000 of my money,
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.920]   but when that $500,000 house appreciates by 10%,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.640]   it goes up to 550.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.560]   My $25,000 just made me $50,000 of equity.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.760]   So it's like I've doubled my money relatively quickly
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.120]   where it's harder to invest in other assets
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.880]   where you can borrow money quite as easily.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   And then there's lots of ways
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.880]   that real estate makes you money.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.760]   You can buy it for less than market value.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.080]   You can't really do that with a stock.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.240]   You can't go get a deal on Tesla stock or Apple stock
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.080]   and find some way to get it cheaper.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.920]   You can add value to the property.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.800]   You can make it bigger.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   You can make it nicer.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.640]   You can fix it out.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.200]   You can change its use so that it can be rented to people.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.840]   That creates actual equity,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.120]   which you can't do with a stock.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.960]   There's nothing I can do if I buy Tesla stock
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.600]   to make that company worth more.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.280]   And then like Rob mentioned, it actually generates revenue.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.520]   You can rent out spaces in that home.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.000]   And when you do that correctly,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.480]   you earn more money every month
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.080]   than what it costs to own the real estate.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.280]   And that difference is what we refer to as cashflow
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.160]   and that can replace active income.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.040]   For anyone listening from all the hacks
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.000]   that hasn't really got into real estate investing,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.600]   you guys have done a great job.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   I'm gonna throw out an episode
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.400]   that is about getting started with just $10,000.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.160]   I think it was episode 730
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.800]   'cause I tried to take some notes ahead of time,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.480]   but that was excellent.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.640]   I will say the goal of this conversation
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.600]   is to kind of walk through the home buying process,
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.040]   whether you're trying to invest,
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.000]   whether you're just trying to buy your primary residence,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.160]   whether you're buying even a vacation home or something.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.600]   So if you're listening and you're thinking,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.160]   "I don't know if I'm ready for real estate investing,"
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.640]   one, maybe you should be.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.320]   And two, this is gonna be applicable to anyone,
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.720]   no matter what type of home you're buying,
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.760]   hopefully is what we can get to.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.640]   So I don't know, that's a little bit of the why.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.200]   For me, I've never actually dabbled too hard
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.920]   in real estate investing outside of index fund REITs,
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.560]   but I've gone through the home buying process
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.900]   as a primary residence,
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.220]   and I actually own a fractional vacation home.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.000]   So I own 1/8 of a home through a program called Picasso,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.520]   where we bought 1/8 of a home up in Napa.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.360]   It's kind of interesting 'cause you can kind of invest.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.000]   It's kind of a lot better, in my opinion,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.680]   than a timeshare or anything like that.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.520]   So that's been great.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.600]   So that's my experience.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   And I've kind of optimized little pieces of it
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.780]   along the way, but nothing like what you guys have.
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.080]   So I'm excited.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.240]   Curious, Chris, how well have you done?
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.000]   I think you said you bought a primary residence
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.080]   that you live in, right?
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.660]   Yep, I've done that twice now.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.580]   Has that investment, if you just looked at it
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.040]   from a pure investment perspective,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.480]   outperformed some of the other things you've invested in?
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.080]   The first time around, yes,
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.640]   but I had the fortunate luck of buying in the Bay Area
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.160]   at the bottom of the worst real estate crash.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.320]   So I got quite lucky by timing.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.160]   Didn't know it was gonna do as well as it did.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.440]   The most recent one, I don't think it's been long enough
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.920]   to see anything major differences yet.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.160]   But the first one, if you layer in taxes
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.840]   and leverage, yeah, it was a great investment.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.240]   But it's hard with an N of one in a market
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.200]   that blew up like crazy to feel like I know too much
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.840]   based on one success story.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.760]   That's how it works though, honestly.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.080]   It really does work like that sometimes for people
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.240]   where for me, I think every real estate investor,
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.280]   they all have this big lofty dream of becoming a millionaire
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.960]   and it's super achievable because you can buy
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.900]   five properties that appreciate
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.880]   over the course of five, 10 years,
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.760]   and you could just have a million dollars in equity
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.200]   and it wasn't necessarily because you were a genius
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.280]   or because you had the most, I don't know,
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.920]   I already said a genius strategy, right?
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.560]   But it happens because you just did it
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.320]   and you kept doing it and you keep doing it consistently.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.480]   And that's really the secret sauce.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.960]   So yeah, maybe it was by luck that you bought that house
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.800]   or in that market.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.120]   But what a lot of people end up doing is when that happens,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.000]   they get a taste for it and then they keep just buying
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.480]   and buying and buying and buying.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   And I think if you do that consistently,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.480]   no matter what, you'll always look like a genius
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.880]   30 years from now.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.880]   - Yeah, I mean, we could have a much longer debate
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.760]   in a future date about debating that strategy,
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.960]   putting it in a stock market,
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.040]   all these other investments.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.500]   But I think whether you wanna build a portfolio of 20 homes,
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.960]   whether you wanna buy multifamily homes,
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.800]   commercial properties,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.120]   or you just wanna buy a primary residence,
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.340]   at the end of the day, you gotta find a home,
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.180]   you gotta buy the home,
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.540]   you gotta decide if it's a good deal,
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.460]   you gotta close on it,
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.920]   you gotta fund the purchase
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.040]   unless you wanna buy it with cash,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.880]   which I'm guessing most people don't.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.240]   So maybe let's jump into that process
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.200]   and kick off with just someone who's like,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.920]   "I'm not really sure what I'm doing."
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.880]   You've been an agent.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.880]   Let's talk a little bit about that process
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.000]   of partnering with someone
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.920]   to help you go through this process
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.000]   instead of just trying to wing it on your own
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.560]   and when that makes sense or maybe when it doesn't.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.240]   - Yeah, and if you're gonna buy a property,
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.080]   you don't know much about it,
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.880]   you definitely wanna use a real estate agent
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.840]   in the beginning.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.720]   And when you're buying,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.440]   here's something people don't realize,
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.480]   you don't have to pay your agent.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.480]   If you're buying a house off of the MLS,
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.760]   this would be any property you see off Zillow or Redfin,
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.940]   something like that.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.080]   The seller has already predetermined
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.360]   a certain amount of money.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.480]   They are going to pay the buyer's agent
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.240]   for bringing you to the property.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.920]   So you have a lot of questions,
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.680]   there's paperwork you're not going to understand,
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.120]   you don't know what the process is, it's intimidating.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.600]   You find a real estate agent and I'll add,
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.440]   they're not all the same.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.840]   There's good agents and bad agents,
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.440]   there's good lawyers and bad lawyers,
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.480]   good doctors and bad ones.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.960]   You really wanna find somebody who's good at what they do.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.240]   They can take a lot of the fear that you have
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.080]   right out of it.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.800]   I mean, it's amazing when you take this scary process
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.040]   and there's a person that, like me,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.200]   that does this so often, it's boring to me.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.440]   Like, "Oh, another one of these.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.420]   "I've walked this path so many times."
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.000]   It's definitely not scary.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.500]   So that's something that every person
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.500]   who wants to buy a home should know right off the bat.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.700]   Find a buyer's agent.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.180]   They're gonna answer a lot of the questions
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.840]   that you're gonna have and they're going to protect you
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.380]   in ways you didn't even know
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.820]   that you needed to be protected.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.700]   And maybe we can go through
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.780]   what the actual escrow process looks like
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.180]   or the process from start to finish
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.300]   of what to expect when buying a home if you'd like.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.060]   If you're a little bit more experienced,
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.660]   you bought homes before,
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.940]   one thing that people will look at,
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.860]   especially in a competitive market like ours, Chris,
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.260]   we just realized that we're neighbors.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.360]   We live pretty close to each other.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.900]   Probably I can power in some change away,
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.440]   is you can go directly to the listing agent
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.540]   and you can say, "Hey, I will let you represent me
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.720]   "on this deal, but I'm gonna need some kind of an advantage.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.540]   "I need you to get my offer accepted over the other people,
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.660]   "or I'd like a little bit of a discount on the price
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.500]   "if you're gonna need to represent me here."
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.460]   So there are people who buy a lot of real estate
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.800]   that has said, "Hey, I don't think I need
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.620]   "my own buyer's agent necessarily.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.460]   "I still need someone to handle the paperwork."
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.220]   But they go right to the listing agent
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.220]   and they look for an advantage.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.620]   And that is pretty popular in the Bay Area
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.060]   where most listings are getting
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.780]   several offers on all of them.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.900]   - Actually, I have bought two homes in the Bay Area
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.140]   and both times I've used the seller's agent.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.560]   So we can talk about that a little bit more
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.820]   'cause I have some thoughts about it,
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.940]   but maybe rewind a little.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.140]   You said it's important not all agents are the same.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.580]   You gotta pick the right one.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.200]   Obviously not everyone lives in the Bay Area,
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.940]   so you're not gonna be the perfect agent for everyone.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.980]   How does someone find that perfect agent?
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.060]   - First thing to look for,
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.060]   find a person that sells a lot of houses.
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.020]   Lot of agents don't.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.260]   In fact, most agents don't.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.740]   I'd say 90% of agents sell a couple houses a year or less.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.040]   And it's unpopular to say this.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.380]   The agents get angry 'cause they're offended right now.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.180]   Like, "Just because I only sell two houses a year
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.220]   "doesn't mean I'm not good."
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.380]   Okay, I know.
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.060]   However, tell me anything that you do twice a year
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.580]   that you get really, really good at.
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.140]   In general, that's how life works.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.360]   If you snowboard twice a year for your whole life,
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.020]   you never really get that good at snowboarding.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.540]   Or it takes you 20 years before you're as good as somebody
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.320]   that just snowboarded every weekend
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.840]   for the whole first year that they got into it.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.380]   Repetition really does develop mastery.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.580]   I talk about that in the Burr book that I wrote.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.660]   So the first thing I look for
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.740]   is an agent that sells a lot of homes, period.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.100]   The next thing I want is an agent
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.100]   that owns real estate themselves.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.940]   At minimum, they gotta own their own house.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.620]   But ideally, I want them to own investment property.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.980]   It gives a completely different perspective
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.420]   when you've bought a home and you believe in it
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.020]   and you just get a different set of goggles
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.380]   to look at real estate through.
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.420]   I don't have any kids.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.240]   I love kids.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.740]   We were talking about that before the show.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.560]   But each of you as a dad, I am sure,
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.360]   sees something different when you look at a kid than I do.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.780]   I don't immediately freak out
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.780]   when they start putting something in their nose.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.000]   I haven't had enough experience
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.700]   of seeing how that could go wrong.
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.540]   Rob has seen some of that.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.540]   So he's gonna have a much different emotional response
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.400]   to that marble or that Play-Doh
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.500]   getting a little bit close to the nostrils.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.380]   Real estate agents that own real estate have that sixth sense.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.240]   They can recognize that's a bad neighborhood,
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.580]   that's not the right tenant,
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.920]   that's not the right floor plan,
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.980]   that's not the right structure.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.940]   You really wanna go to this house
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.060]   that may not look as pretty in the pictures
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.060]   but will be a better deal.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.140]   The third thing that you wanna look for
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.740]   is an agent that understands
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.620]   the financial component of real estate.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.260]   Many real estate agents are geared
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.120]   to cater to their clients' emotions.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.100]   They wanna be liked.
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.180]   They're very high as an eye on the disc profile.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.040]   This is how they make their money, by being likable.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.580]   Most people reach out to the agent
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.500]   who's the nicest, the friendliest, the warmest.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.200]   That doesn't mean they're the smartest.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.500]   So when you're having conversations,
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.780]   I always wanna hear agents that are approaching real estate
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.220]   from a financial perspective.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.580]   I wanna hear them telling me,
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.580]   "This is the part of town that's being redeveloped.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.760]   "This is the next up and coming area.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.020]   "This is where all the money is going into.
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.240]   "This is a property that would function as a rental
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.600]   "if you moved out."
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.480]   Even if that's not necessarily what you're looking for,
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.820]   you just wanna buy a home.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.780]   If your agent sees things that way,
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.740]   it is very good to hedge your bets in the future
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.260]   'cause you never know when you have more kids,
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.780]   need more bedrooms, get a new job,
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.260]   wanna move for some reason.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.980]   You don't wanna be locked into a situation
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.140]   where it's hard to sell that home
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.740]   or it can't be used as a rental property
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.740]   if you wanna leave it.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.100]   - David, let me ask you something.
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.860]   Does the requirement of having an agent
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.020]   that owns real estate,
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.500]   is that as important if you're just buying
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.380]   a primary residence?
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.820]   Do you weight that a lot heavier
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.700]   for people that are looking to buy investment properties?
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.500]   - No, it's the same for a primary residence.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.340]   Let me tell you why.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.020]   The first house I ever bought,
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.500]   my agent did not own any real estate.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.980]   And I bought this house in the very end of 2009.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.540]   Great time to buy real estate, like you were saying, Chris.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.780]   My agent did not tell me that the property taxes
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.420]   in that area had special assessments assigned to them
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.720]   and were much higher than the normal property taxes.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.080]   In fact, they ended up being about $250 a month higher.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.820]   So I was expecting 300, they were 550.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.380]   Now, I was buying this as a rental property,
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.140]   but even if I had bought buying it to live in,
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.260]   and again, I remember at the time,
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.300]   the total mortgage was like $1,300.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.500]   So bumping it from 1,300 to 1,550
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.980]   was a pretty significant chunk.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.380]   It's like a 20% increase almost in my overall payment
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.100]   because they overlooked that property taxes were higher.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.780]   Now, agents who own real estate themselves
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.620]   would be familiar with the fact
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.220]   that property tax bills come.
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.140]   There's more expenses than just your principal
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.620]   and interest on your mortgage.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.860]   They would see angles like insurance can increase
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.460]   in this area because it's in a flood zone.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.760]   I really think she missed it
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.260]   because she had never paid a mortgage on her own.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.940]   She never had her taxes and her insurance escrowed
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.580]   into her mortgage payment.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.000]   The next time I bought a house,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.940]   it was with an agent that had been selling houses
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.660]   for a very long time and sold a lot
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.220]   and owned a lot of real estate herself.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.660]   And as we went through the process, she educated me.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.380]   You don't wanna buy on that part of town
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.720]   because you're gonna pay extra money
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.020]   to get the better school districts.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.360]   You don't wanna buy over there 'cause the taxes are higher.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.640]   You don't wanna buy a house like that
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.820]   because with that kind of a roof,
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.660]   your insurance is gonna be a lot higher.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.380]   I learned so much about investing in real estate
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.700]   just from the person that was getting paid to help me.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.460]   It was like free advice and free knowledge
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.100]   and it really gave me a different perspective
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.760]   of what to look for and what to avoid.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.600]   - I love it.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.460]   When it comes to optimizing the home buying experience,
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.540]   I can't think of a better example of me doing this myself
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.820]   than when we thought about buying a vacation home.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.080]   Now, I've long thought that buying a second home
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.980]   was a terrible financial decision
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.300]   because the sheer fact that it's a second home
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.000]   means there's no way you're gonna be spending
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.100]   the whole year there,
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.540]   which means you're either paying for a house to sit empty
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.180]   or you have to manage a rental property,
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.900]   which I just don't wanna do.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.700]   So how do you optimize that?
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.600]   Well, instead of buying the whole home,
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.820]   we just bought 1/8 of a home for 1/8 the price
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.420]   and we did it all through Picasso,
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.100]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.140]   So how does it work?
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.500]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.080]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.060]   creates an LLC for each home,
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.660]   and you can buy as little as 1/8 of the property.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.960]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.860]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.180]   handling design, cleaning, maintenance,
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.340]   bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.060]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.100]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.940]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.860]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.340]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.660]   We love our Picasso.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.980]   I think you will too.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.940]   So for a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.820]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.060]   where our listeners will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.600]   which means you can see new listings
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.580]   before they go live on the website
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.700]   and get up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.940]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.360]   P-A-C-A-S-S-O.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.500]   I have so many exciting projects happening right now.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.140]   I launched the All The Hacks membership,
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.700]   I'm working on a book proposal,
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.700]   and that's on top of running the podcast and newsletter.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.060]   Even just a few years ago,
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.260]   I would have been running all that
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.500]   with some combo of Google Docs, Office Files and Dropbox,
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.180]   a private wiki site, emails back and forth,
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.820]   and probably other things I can't think of
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.700]   because I forgot where they are.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.500]   I can't believe how crazy I ran things,
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.540]   but now pretty much every project we have for our family
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.300]   and All The Hacks is organized in Notion.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.020]   I love the product so much,
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.180]   which makes it so easy to be excited
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.060]   to partner with them on this episode.

[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.900]   and stop paying too much for them too.

[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.060]   - I just sent a link to you.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.020]   There's this guy in Northern California,
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.780]   maybe you know him, Stanley Lowe,
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.820]   number one agent in Northern California for 10 years,
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.140]   looks like and is commonly described in San Mateo County
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.380]   as like the Asian Elvis of real estate agents.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.140]   And so when you first said,
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.820]   "Look for someone who sells a lot of houses,"
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.180]   I know this guy, I get the flyers in the mail,
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.700]   like he sells all the houses, high volume, high throughput,
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.640]   not just low income property, all kinds of price ranges.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.460]   Does that mean that if I were looking for a real estate agent
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.460]   like, would he be the right guy?
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.340]   Should I consider him?
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.100]   Even though it might not feel like someone's personality,
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.340]   maybe that's not the personality I would want
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.460]   as my real estate agent.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.300]   But like, do the numbers speak more than a personality?
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.140]   How do you think about that?
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.660]   And if anyone's curious, greenbanker.com
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.920]   is this real estate agent's website.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.500]   - He's got it down, I will say that.
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.900]   I mean, the marketing, the cowhide blazer
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.220]   and the big circular glasses, I'm in, personally.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.460]   - That's funny, 'cause I'd be running the other way
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.020]   the minute I saw this.
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.900]   So he does sell a lot of homes, I'm sure.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.880]   And so he probably does have some experience.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.540]   My gut would tell me, as someone who has worked
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.260]   with a lot of clients and knows a lot of realtors,
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.420]   this is probably not someone
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.460]   who's actually going to be representing you.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.660]   He's going to have staff
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.000]   that are going to be handling a lot of it.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.900]   You're not gonna be talking to Stanley.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.900]   And he's going to likely make up
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.100]   for a lack of negotiation ability
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.380]   and focus on saving you money or making you money,
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.620]   if it's a listing, with his personality.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.020]   So he's a great marketer.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.100]   And the top producing agents are always the best marketers.
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.860]   This is a problem in our industry.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.960]   The best agents don't make the most money.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.540]   The ones that are best at getting the phone to ring
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.900]   make the most money, but that doesn't mean
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.160]   that they're the best when it comes to representing you.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.620]   - So you want someone that sold a lot of houses,
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.140]   but maybe you don't necessarily want the person
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.820]   who markets themselves as the person
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.540]   who sold the most houses.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.180]   So it's kind of that sweet spot
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.420]   of maybe like the 60th to 90th percentile,
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.740]   but not the very top.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.360]   - There's a lot of things people fall for.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.140]   I sell the most houses in this neighborhood.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.820]   Realtors will use that as a way of saying,
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.940]   "I'm the best. Don't fall for that."
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.720]   It makes sense to our perspective
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.560]   when we're listing the home,
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.020]   "Oh, you sell all the houses in the neighborhood.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.760]   You know how to get me top dollar."
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.780]   You just don't realize until you think about it,
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.220]   the buyers don't care.
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.120]   The buyers don't care who's selling that house.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.520]   They are never going to look at who the listing agent is
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.360]   when they're writing their offer.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.880]   They just care about the house.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.800]   The buyer's agent needs to know the neighborhood.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.480]   The buyer's agent needs to know the amenities.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.880]   When you're looking to buy somewhere,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.760]   you want an agent that knows the area very well.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.120]   When you're looking to sell,
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.100]   it will never matter how many homes
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.760]   in the area that agent sold.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.680]   In fact, the only reason they sell a lot of homes
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.080]   in the same area is they put their sign in all the yards,
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.320]   and then they go, we call it farming,
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.660]   knocking on all the doors and meeting all the people,
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.920]   getting their name out there.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.880]   They're just able to utilize a listing
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.240]   to build leverage to get more.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.880]   But there's no competitive advantage
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.560]   when it comes to representing a seller
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.880]   if you've sold other homes in the area.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.640]   I wanted to add one thing to that.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.440]   Well, A, it sounds like if they're putting signs
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.680]   in everyone's yards, sounds like they're good marketers,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.760]   which goes back to what you were saying.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.520]   But I did want to say that one really important piece
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.560]   to agents, just from a consumer side,
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.440]   and as someone that relies on agents pretty heavily,
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.540]   is them having a really thorough Rolodex
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.480]   of vendors that I can use to help me run my properties,
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.000]   whether I'm living in it or not.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.240]   If I'm buying a short-term rental, for example,
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.560]   I know I need a contractor, cleaner, landscaper,
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.480]   pool maintenance person, pest control,
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   and probably a plumber, electrician,
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.300]   and all that type of stuff.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.480]   So when I'm calling a realtor,
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.760]   and this goes into how many houses have they sold,
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.920]   if they've sold a lot of houses over the last five, 10 years,
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.080]   they probably have a pretty thorough Rolodex,
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.320]   I mean, outdated term.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.500]   If they use the term Rolodex, maybe they're not with it.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.120]   But if they have a very big contact list
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.640]   of all these different vendors,
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.800]   that's what I'm personally looking for in a realtor,
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.360]   because a lot of the times,
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.380]   I really need a firsthand referral
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.840]   to know that I can successfully either live in a property
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.060]   or execute a rental.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.360]   - Yeah, that Rolodex is interesting.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.200]   Something I never saw in the contract,
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.720]   but once you close, I was surprised
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   that even though it's not necessarily required,
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.320]   a good agent will spend so much time
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.480]   helping make sure the process from,
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.960]   I closed to, I moved in, I got the yard done,
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   I renovate, even renovated something.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.240]   They've been super helpful there.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.200]   We have a lot to go here,
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.440]   but I do wanna touch quickly on that negotiating piece
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.000]   that you mentioned earlier, David.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.420]   When someone's trying to get into this,
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.900]   what leverage or room is there for negotiating?
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.960]   I did what you suggested.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.680]   I went to the seller's agent and said,
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.040]   "Hey, I don't wanna mess around.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.100]   "I know I want this house.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.560]   "I don't need to go find another agent.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.980]   "I feel good in negotiating.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.720]   "Will you work with me?"
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.900]   It ended up being a great situation
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.680]   because that agent got more commission
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.200]   and was a little bit more biased
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.840]   towards trying to get my purchase over the finish line.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.600]   And in one case, rebated 1% of their fee back to me.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.600]   Are there other rooms for negotiation?
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.240]   Are there other tactics someone can use
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.400]   to get a better price or likelihood of getting accepted?
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.860]   Well, the first thing you have to do is define a win.
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.440]   So in a situation where the house is getting 10 offers,
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.240]   a win is just getting it at all.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.680]   There are times in the Bay Area or other hot markets
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.840]   with restricted supply and lack of inventory
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.080]   that you're just not gonna get a home, period.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.880]   It's incredibly hard to get in contract
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.680]   you're competing with so many people.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.760]   So in those situations,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.080]   you're not gonna get a discount from your listing agent.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.200]   You're not gonna get a better price on the home.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.760]   You just have to get it.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.260]   Now in other situations,
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.640]   which is what I try to target my clients into,
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.800]   I show them properties that less people are competing with.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.360]   The listing photos are ugly.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.520]   It's been in contract, it fell out of contract.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.200]   Now the days on market have ticked up
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.340]   and people aren't looking at it anymore.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.280]   I look for opportunities to help them get into a property
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.400]   with much less interest
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.880]   and then we can get them a discount on the price.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.160]   We can save them some money there.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.320]   A mistake a lot of people make
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.720]   is they go to the listing agent
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   of an incredibly hot property.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.160]   They ask for a discount from the listing agent
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.320]   and they go, "No, there's like 12 other people
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.400]   "that wanna buy this house.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.960]   "I can get my client a hundred grand more
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.100]   "going with a different offer.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.440]   "I'm not gonna discount commission just to help you get it."
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.360]   So that's a big piece is knowing
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.320]   when you have leverage and when you don't.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.280]   - I wanna talk about making that offer now, right?
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.960]   Like let's say someone's gone through this process,
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.040]   they pick their agent,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.440]   they've figured out what they're doing
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.040]   and they find a house and they're trying to decide,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.880]   is this a good house?
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.640]   So let's start with that before we get to the offer.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.240]   It's like you have a place in mind,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.080]   you're looking at this listing.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.640]   Maybe you do, maybe you don't have an agent yet,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.160]   but what are the things that are really important
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.940]   for someone to be paying attention to
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.200]   when they're looking at a listing
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.040]   either online or in person?
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.920]   - I like to find stuff that needs a little bit of work,
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.380]   a little TLC personally on my end,
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.200]   just because I don't really like paying the premium
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.880]   of someone else's fine-tuned work
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.520]   that I probably don't like anyway.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.240]   So I don't wanna go in and usually do like a full rehab.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.440]   That's not really my space,
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.480]   but I'm looking for something that I can really spice up
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.200]   with a nice paint job,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.700]   maybe doing a lighter cosmetic renovation,
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.800]   like changing out the floors or something like that.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   So I'm not necessarily looking for top tier,
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.400]   I'm just looking for something that I can come in
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.140]   and kind of add my touch to.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.160]   I don't really like paying
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.760]   for turnkey properties personally,
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.560]   but it all comes down to what your buy box is.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.480]   What about you, David?
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.760]   - In a hot market like where we are today,
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.200]   it's usually a good time to buy real estate
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.320]   because when there are more buyers
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.300]   than there are product to buy,
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.960]   the odds of prices increasing are favorable
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.400]   because you've got a favorable supply demand ratio there.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.960]   However, it becomes harder to get into the asset
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.200]   in those environments,
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.540]   which is why most people get discouraged.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.580]   There's also an element where people aren't educated,
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.600]   so they all chase after the same homes.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.880]   They want the ones with the best listing photos,
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.040]   the best locations, they're moving ready,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.760]   that gives you that emotional tingle that you just love.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.980]   You're just looking for something
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.560]   that other people are gonna pass up
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.180]   that you see the value in,
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.120]   that you're gonna put a little bit of elbow grease into.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.480]   Sometimes bad smells can really benefit you
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.320]   when you're trying to buy a home
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.560]   'cause it's gonna turn off a lot of your competition.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.520]   Ugly floor plans.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.400]   People don't realize it's usually not as expensive
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.160]   as you think to move walls around,
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.520]   but when it's got a closed off kitchen,
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.600]   you can't see what's going on in the family room.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.640]   The wife's thinking, I can't see what the kids are doing.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.480]   I just don't like it.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.400]   That's as far as they go.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.480]   They don't realize that you could spend $2,000
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.640]   and move a wall.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.520]   You can see everything that's going on there.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.960]   Then painting and flooring.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.160]   You can fix homes up for a lot less
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.480]   than what people think today,
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.200]   but you have to see the opportunity,
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.960]   not the move-in ready product.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.920]   - And so how does how long the house
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.200]   has been on the market play into this?
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   When you see something that's been on for a while.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.680]   - When a seller first puts their house on the market,
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.320]   they have all the leverage.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.640]   They have tons of interest.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.100]   People are going to look at their home.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.680]   Showings are being scheduled.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.080]   Agents are calling all excited.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.080]   We really love the house.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.160]   Do you have any other offers?
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.060]   It's this frenetic, crazy, emotional pace
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.400]   where the sellers are trying to think of
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.040]   how can I leverage this to get as much money as possible,
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.080]   which is really where I'm trying to guide my clients away.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.040]   I don't want you in that feeding frenzy.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.320]   If no one buys that house after 14 to 21 days,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.920]   interest is starting to slow.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.440]   By day 30, day 40, they're getting worried, okay?
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.800]   It's not who's the best guy that I can take
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.160]   that gets to take me to prom.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.120]   It's, am I going to prom at all?
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.080]   I just want a date.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.440]   Does anyone want to buy my house?
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.280]   I'm stuck.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.640]   I might not be able to move.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.080]   And I write about this in some of the books
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.920]   that I've published for BiggerPockets for agents.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.280]   There's this spectrum of fear and greed.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.600]   We usually all start off on the greed side.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.840]   And as you slide across, you end up in the fear side.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.120]   And you're worried, I might not sell the house at all.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.480]   So in most markets,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.480]   depending on what your average day is on market,
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   like this wouldn't apply in an area
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.920]   with $7 million homes that tend to sit on the market
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.560]   for six months before they sell.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.520]   But for your regular starter homes,
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.200]   they should be selling in less than 30 days
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.280]   in most markets in the country.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.520]   So the minute you get past that point,
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.800]   you're going to start seeing some worry in sellers
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.280]   and they will be open to more aggressive offers
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.440]   or terms that are more favorable to the buyer.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.000]   - What happens if you are in a hot market
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.520]   and let's say you've identified a neighborhood,
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.280]   you've looked, maybe a house comes on
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.360]   every two or three months,
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.560]   and you know like, this is what I want.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.960]   You say, the moment that house comes on the market,
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.680]   it's hot, it's the worst time.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.000]   Is there a way to find homes
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.840]   before they get on the market and buy them?
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.480]   Is that finding the right agent?
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.360]   Or how do you get what might be a hot home before it's hot?
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.240]   - Rob, what have you been doing?
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.880]   You've gotten a couple of deals this way.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.640]   - Let's see, there's the creative finance
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.880]   and the sub two deal, right?
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.280]   And that's effectively where you're cold calling
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.760]   a bunch of property owners and also wholesaling
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.680]   where you cold call property owners
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.320]   and basically try to buy the property directly from them
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.920]   versus going the realtor route.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.160]   That's a very popular niche within real estate.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.920]   But honestly, I think having a really big network
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.000]   of realtors that you're friendly with is super important
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.560]   and more than just having like a bunch of realtors
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.000]   in your network.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.600]   And this is sort of where the marketing thing
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.320]   kind of comes into play too.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.960]   But finding a realtor that's very good at marketing
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.760]   and having a vast network of realtor friends
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.920]   that can pass each other deals to you
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.080]   or pass deals to each other, that to me is super important.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.960]   Because if you find someone that's like a very new
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.160]   and very green in the industry,
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.800]   they probably don't have a lot of other
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.600]   real estate colleagues necessarily.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.680]   But if it's someone that's been working
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.320]   in the industry for a while,
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.400]   they have the opportunity to find all these deals
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.480]   before they ever hit the market.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.400]   So I have realtors that are texting me all the time
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.480]   that they're like, "Hey, my bud just sent me this.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.280]   "It's gonna hit the market next week.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.360]   "They're interested in selling it
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.640]   "before even going to market.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.880]   "Are you interested?"
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.680]   And I'll look at a deal much quicker,
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.400]   much faster and much more intentionally
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.640]   knowing that I've got first dibs on it.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.720]   - Do you think that applies for kind of consumer?
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.640]   If I'm looking to buy a home in a neighborhood,
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.040]   should I just talk to all the agents in the neighborhood
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.240]   and say, "Hey, I'm looking to buy a home.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.280]   "There's nothing on the market I want right now.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.560]   "But I just want you to know,
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.760]   "if you can find me something, I'm ready to go."
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.520]   And just talk to 10 agents.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.960]   Do agents like that kind of behavior or?
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.040]   - No, not really.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.720]   'Cause you kind of send the message
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.720]   that you're looking for an open relationship
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.240]   and they're wanting a committed relationship.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.400]   So it doesn't benefit me as an agent.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.840]   If you come and you're talking to 12 agents in the areas,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.400]   "If you find me the deal, I'll buy it from you."
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.680]   That sounds great, but I don't need to sell it to you.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.200]   If I get a listing, it's so hot right now,
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.080]   everyone's gonna wanna buy it.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.760]   I don't have to discount my commission.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.840]   There's people that would probably give me extra commission
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.120]   if they wanted to get that home.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.800]   Or I wanna be able to go to my seller
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.560]   and tell them I got 10 offers on their home
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.160]   and I wanna look like a rockstar to them.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.960]   So I don't think the go wide instead of deep strategy works,
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.640]   unless it's a buyer's market.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.040]   When you are in those situations
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.000]   where it's very difficult to find someone to buy a home,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.280]   we're talking 2010 when there was first sales signs
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.440]   everywhere, listings were all over the place,
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.520]   REO inventory was massive,
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.040]   but there weren't a lot of pre-approved buyers
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.880]   that were willing to step in and buy a house.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.880]   Then that strategy makes a lot more sense.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.880]   That's where you're reaching out to all these agents saying,
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.600]   "Hey, if you get a deal, bring it to me and I'll buy it
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.760]   because you're the prize in that situation."
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.160]   They need a buyer.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.000]   And you're basically saying,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.040]   "Listen, I'm one of the few buyers that's out there
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:09.880]   that could do this thing,
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.560]   but if you want my business,
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.320]   you're gonna have to make it worth my while."
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.720]   That works a lot better than in a market like today
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.560]   where you're just one out of a whole bunch of other people
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.400]   that are all struggling to try to get a house.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.440]   Yeah, I'm actually really glad you asked that, Chris.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.640]   And I'm glad you clarified, David,
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.480]   because Chris, for reference,
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.040]   I'm in about 16 different markets around the country.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.480]   So I actually have a massive network of realtors
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.600]   in different cities.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.120]   They're all very aware of exactly what I'm looking for.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.800]   So when they get a pocket listing or an off-market listing,
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.200]   they text me directly.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.520]   When I'm working in a city specifically
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.560]   or in a market specifically,
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.080]   I do want just one realtor.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.320]   And that's why I say,
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.800]   I want to find a realtor that's got a lot of realtor friends
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.400]   that can help find some of those off-market deals.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.840]   So it's about finding someone that's connected.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.080]   Is that as simple as just seeing whose name pops up
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.600]   in a neighborhood most for sale signs?
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.360]   Like who represented most of the sales
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.240]   or any other tactics for finding that super connected agent?
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.840]   I see why it would look that way.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.560]   But there are so many real estate agents, Chris.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.000]   The ones you see are the tip of the iceberg.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.240]   There's so many of them.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.440]   There's way too many agents.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.840]   We don't need this many.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.080]   It reminds me of a scene in "The Office"
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.440]   where Dwight and Michael are walking
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.280]   through a crowded room and Dwight says,
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.120]   "There's too many people.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.280]   We need another plague."
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.520]   There's just so many agents that have flooded
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.600]   into the real estate space.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.840]   Like people coming to California in 1849,
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.280]   thinking they're going to strike gold.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.320]   They're all fighting to try to get that seller
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.160]   to think of them.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.520]   It's just this massive marketing campaign
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.560]   that every agent is throwing themselves
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.000]   in front of people.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.880]   And now you've got investors that are also sending letters
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.920]   to those same people saying, "I want to buy your house.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.200]   I want to buy your house."
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.240]   Most home sellers know in general,
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.840]   they have what everyone wants.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.800]   Their home is valuable.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.080]   You're probably not going to put things in your favor
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.280]   by just talking to every real estate agents out there
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.400]   and saying, "Hey, I want to buy a house if you get one."
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.440]   Because if they can get a listing, it's guaranteed to sell.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:02.240]   There's no reason they're going to go to you particularly.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.800]   And then this is a very short question, but it's important.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.280]   How much does the brand behind the agent matter?
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.520]   Is it all about the agent or is it all about the agency
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.000]   they work at or the brokerage firm they work at?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.960]   The only people that think a broker matters is the broker.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.160]   Your clients never care who your broker is.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.640]   It's 100% the agent.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.000]   So if you're trying to find someone and they're like,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.800]   "Oh, you can work with my colleague on this."
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.480]   That's like red flag.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.320]   Big.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.720]   It used to be really useful, just a little history lesson.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.840]   Because there was a time where if you wanted to buy a house
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.280]   that RE/MAX was listing, you had to go to a RE/MAX agent
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.200]   at that office to buy that house.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.720]   So RE/MAX had their listings.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.880]   Coldwell Banker had theirs.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.400]   Century 21 had theirs.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.440]   And you would jump from broker to broker
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.960]   and look at their inventory.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.880]   When we created the multiple listing service,
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.480]   this was an agreement between all brokerages
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.800]   that they would all put their listings
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.480]   into one central location that everybody could see,
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.160]   which eventually morphed into the online listing portals
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.960]   that we all see when we're looking for homes.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.080]   That eliminated the value of going to an individual broker
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.880]   'cause now you can see everybody's inventory
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.160]   in the same place.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.880]   - And if people that you know had success
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.520]   using those online brokers that are like,
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.640]   "We're just gonna cut your rate
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.240]   "and give you huge discounts."
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.520]   I know Redfin does that.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.000]   Have you heard success stories there?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.080]   Is the savings worth it?
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.360]   - In our industry, Chris, I'm just gonna tell you
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.960]   the brutal truth.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.320]   I look for a Redfin agent
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.840]   to be on the other side of the transaction
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.800]   because I know I'm gonna destroy them in negotiation.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.060]   Because they don't make hardly any money on these deals.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.660]   They usually go there when they're desperate for food.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.640]   I'm starving, please Redfin give me some deals
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.200]   or whatever the discount brokerage is.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.840]   I have had massive success,
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.560]   particularly targeting listings that are Redfin listings
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.880]   because those Redfin agents are not all the time.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.640]   I'm sure there's gonna be a Redfin agent out there
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.320]   who's gonna say, "Well, I'm a Redfin agent and I'm good."
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.280]   Yes, they do exist.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.400]   But in general, any of those discount brokerages.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.600]   - I sell the most Redfin homes in this neighborhood.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.720]   - Yeah, in fact, that might even be an advantage
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.380]   to tell people to look for those
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.280]   because your agent is going to have a field day
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.320]   with their agent if you have a good one.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.840]   - Last tip, I got one more tip here.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.560]   If the listing says, "Run, don't walk."
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.000]   It's probably not that great of a listing.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.040]   - We were just talking about this yesterday.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.020]   Every listing agent is putting that their house
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.360]   boasts of five bedrooms, boasts of amazing light,
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.800]   boasts of a great view.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.760]   These houses are just boasting all over the place.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.000]   Bay Area real estate has become very arrogant.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.640]   They're very prideful homes.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.680]   - With the weather warming up and flowers blooming,
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.920]   it is the perfect time to take a fresh look
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.520]   at your financial planning.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.200]   If you've been meaning to get life insurance
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.560]   but have been putting it off, now is the time.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.040]   With Fabric by Gerber Life, it's quick and easy

[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.160]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.480]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive

[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.940]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.760]   not available in certain states,
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.360]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.140]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.660]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.540]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.620]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.560]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.500]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:03.220]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.040]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.900]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.300]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.260]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.740]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.820]   that you got through another week.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.940]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.480]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.240]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.340]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.980]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.560]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.540]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.580]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.420]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.500]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.120]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.580]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.660]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.520]   or go to drizzly.com.

[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.400]   Let's say we find this house,
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.860]   whether it's a hot home,
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.260]   whether it's the home you're not sure about
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.540]   and you wanna rehab a little bit,
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.820]   what do you do when you've got someone
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.140]   and you're like, "I want this home,"
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.740]   or at least I wanna consider it,
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.420]   and you're going through that diligence process
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.940]   of trying to figure out, doing inspections.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.460]   How do you optimize that part of the process
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.180]   to make sure you're getting the right home
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.000]   at the right price?
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.260]   First thing for uninitiated to understand,
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.020]   writing an offer is not a commitment to buy a house.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.020]   A lot of people get stuck dragging their feet.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:39.920]   They don't wanna write an offer.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.120]   They need time to think about it.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.500]   They need time to pray about it.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.760]   They need time to talk to their mom.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.060]   They need time to analyze it.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.620]   By the time they get comfortable writing an offer,
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.700]   someone's already bought the house.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.540]   This happens a lot of the time.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.820]   When you write an offer,
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.660]   most of the time you will include a contingency,
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.700]   which is an allowance to back out of the deal
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.620]   and recover your earnest money deposit
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.500]   if you find something you don't like.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.220]   The main three contingencies are inspection contingencies,
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.620]   appraisals, and loans.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:04.740]   So if you can't get your loan,
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.180]   the house doesn't appraise at value,
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.640]   or something is revealed when you're inspecting the home,
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.380]   which can, in most cases, literally be,
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.460]   "I looked at the front lawn
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.020]   "and I didn't like the way the grass looked
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.180]   "when I inspected it.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.100]   "I want out."
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.940]   You can use that contingency for just about anything.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.000]   It's okay to rush to put a house in contract
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.700]   and then slow down when you're in contract
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.180]   and order your pest inspection,
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.220]   order your home inspection,
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.300]   order your pool inspection,
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.360]   order your roof inspection,
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.300]   whatever it is that you're looking to do.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.780]   Take your time from that point,
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.260]   and if you decide you don't like the house,
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.180]   you want to back out, you can without penalty.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.740]   - What about hot markets where there's no contingencies,
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.560]   or people are saying,
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.500]   "We're not accepting offers with contingencies."
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.720]   Are there secret contingencies you can kind of put in?
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.700]   Are there ways to get out?
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.580]   Or what do you think about those?
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.380]   - Oh man, you're going for the good stuff here.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.260]   There's a couple, right?
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.060]   Here's a couple hacks that I'll share with you
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.740]   that normally you got to be my client
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.060]   if you want me to know this.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.820]   There's a rule in California
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.540]   that once you receive the disclosures on a property,
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.620]   you have seven days to back out after receiving them.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.620]   It gives you time as a buyer to review these disclosures.
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.420]   That is not a part of the contract that realtors use.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.460]   That is a state law that cannot be waived in a contract.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.340]   Many times, listing agents,
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.140]   because like I said, they're not all good.
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.300]   You get that discount agent,
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.300]   you get the person that hardly sells homes.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.140]   They're arrogant, like,
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.100]   "Oh, I'm going to sell this thing
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.380]   because everybody wants my listing."
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.240]   But they don't know those little rules.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.980]   So we've had times with our clients
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.820]   where the listing agent
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.420]   did not provide the disclosures up front.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.900]   They just didn't have their clients fill them out.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.060]   The clients didn't want to fill them out.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.780]   They didn't know why they were important.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.100]   If I see there's no disclosures,
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.860]   then they make me waive contingencies.
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.780]   I will put the house in contract,
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.940]   wait for them to give me those disclosures,
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.220]   and then the timeline starts.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.820]   Try to remember if it's three days or seven days.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.100]   I believe it's seven days.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.100]   Anyway, we then have a period of time
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.800]   to decide if we want to move forward on that house.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.240]   And we backed out and they said,
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.780]   "Well, you don't have an inspection contingency."
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.660]   We said, "Yeah, here's the disclosure law.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.020]   There's nothing you could do about that."
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.380]   That's one loophole that we've looked for.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.820]   - That's good.
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.380]   You dirty dog.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.980]   Everybody go back 30 seconds and listen to that again.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.820]   That is so good.
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.100]   I can see why you didn't want to necessarily
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.300]   say that on the podcast.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.540]   You don't want people to know.
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.620]   - That's exactly right.
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.420]   And so when I'm selling homes as a listing agent,
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.340]   we have our people fill these disclosures out.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.180]   And if you write an offer to buy the house,
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.580]   the first thing I do is say,
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.460]   "Review these before we even accept your offer."
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.540]   I want it to be signed that you've looked at them
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.160]   to start that timeline as fast as possible.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.760]   I also, it's why I want people to come to me
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.600]   to be their agent.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.180]   Because like I said, when you use an agent
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.580]   that doesn't sell a lot of homes, they don't know that.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:33.220]   And even more importantly, I know that they don't know.
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.900]   And when I sense that as the agent,
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.580]   that's where I start shifting everything
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.540]   to protect my client.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.580]   Another one that people don't think about,
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.940]   usually when you buy a house,
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.500]   you have a period of time to send in
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.620]   your earnest money deposit.
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.900]   So there are certain times where there's two houses
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:47.780]   and you like them both,
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.860]   and you don't know if you're gonna get one.
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.360]   So you write offers on both houses,
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.660]   and then you get lucky and end up with two of them.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.540]   What am I gonna do now, right?
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.140]   Well, if you don't send the earnest money deposit in
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.260]   and you cancel the contract,
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.460]   there's really no recourse that the seller has
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.200]   to come back after you and say,
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.660]   "No, you have to give me money for this."
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.420]   There is no money in the escrow to take out.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.540]   So when you're a buyer,
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.300]   either put a longer period of time
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.780]   before you have to put in your earnest money
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.580]   and use that time to do your inspections,
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:14.940]   do your praying, talk to your mom,
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.060]   go through your due diligence.
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.180]   Or in some cases, I will admit,
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.160]   I bought houses out of state and the listing agent
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.700]   and the escrow company literally did not ever check
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.840]   to see if I sent the earnest money in.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.940]   I've closed on several houses in Tennessee
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.220]   that I never sent the earnest money for the entire escrow.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.660]   And nobody even asked about it.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.700]   I just sent the whole money in to close.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.780]   And I was fascinated that that happened,
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.380]   but it probably happens in more markets than people think.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.900]   Or with agents that aren't experienced selling houses
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.100]   like this hypothetical Redfin agent we talked about
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.140]   that doesn't even know they're supposed to check.
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.940]   You might make it 10, 12, 14 days
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:53.140]   before an escrow officer realizes,
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.740]   "Oh, we don't have earnest money."
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.500]   And they contact your client about looking into it,
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.520]   which is plenty of time to get some of those inspections
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.220]   done without a contingency.
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.060]   - I love that.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.740]   And it's funny because I took that strategy
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.000]   we mentioned earlier where I used the seller's agent.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.700]   And in fact, we made an offer
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.380]   and they set disclosures like two hours
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.340]   before we made the offer.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.620]   It's like quick cursory glance.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.020]   Fortunately, everything worked out,
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.180]   but I did not get reminded by the seller's agent
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.060]   that I might have some time to back out.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.940]   And I think that's one of the risks
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.820]   when you use the seller's agent
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.160]   is that they might give you a little bit of the edge
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.320]   to try to get the deal done
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.780]   'cause they might make a little bit more.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.820]   Not at the risk of completely tanking
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.640]   the purchase price for their seller,
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.940]   but they're certainly not gonna try to come up
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.620]   with creative ways to save the deal and get you out.
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.700]   - Yeah, of course not.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.980]   Those bros ain't loyal, not to you.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.820]   - That's awesome.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.580]   Any other things when you're going through inspections,
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.340]   things that people often miss, things that you learn?
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.620]   I feel like every time, and it's only happened two times,
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.780]   but every time I bought a home,
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.900]   like 30 days later, I'm like, "How did I miss that?"
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.340]   Any tips for finding all the that's?
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.340]   - (laughs) Yeah, sure.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.580]   So I think one thing to keep in mind,
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.500]   and David kind of hit the nail on the head with this one,
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.500]   is if it's your goal to get into a property,
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.260]   get into escrow as fast as possible.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.300]   I typically run two sets of analytics,
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.980]   especially with rental portfolios.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.340]   I have my back of the napkin analytics,
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.280]   where I just wanna know, does this property feasibly work?
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.500]   If it kind of does, okay, great.
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.700]   I go into escrow,
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.960]   and then I run my deep dive analytics for that.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.420]   The reason I say this is because a lot of people,
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.220]   like David said, will spend so much time
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.060]   just getting analysis paralysis,
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.660]   and then they'll lose out on the deal.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.260]   One of those things that typically give me
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.900]   a lot of analysis paralysis back when I started
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.940]   was this little phrase in the listing that says,
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.500]   "As is, seller not willing to make any repairs
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.620]   to the property."
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.860]   And so that held me back from ever buying properties
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.100]   or ever making offers until I figured out
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.480]   that that really doesn't mean anything.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.980]   Really, you can buy a property as is,
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.420]   but David, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.360]   there's no actual legal paperwork that is signed
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.460]   that says that you can't actually ask for concessions.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.300]   'Cause what's happened for me 100% of the time
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.860]   is I'll make the offer on an "as is" house,
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.500]   and then I get the inspection report,
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.340]   and guess what?
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.140]   I asked the seller for $10,000 worth of repairs
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.860]   or a $2,000 credit or whatever, right?
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.820]   So just because something says "as is"
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.760]   doesn't necessarily mean that you have to take
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.700]   that at face value.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.560]   And that's something that I think a lot of people miss
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.500]   when they're buying their first or second or third property.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.100]   100% correct.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.220]   I laugh in the face of "as is."
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.580]   It means nothing.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:25.540]   Nothing!
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.780]   "As is" is a completely toothless claim.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.860]   When someone says, "I'm selling my property as is,"
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.700]   what they're saying is,
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.980]   "I don't want to make any further concessions."
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.100]   But no seller wants to make concessions.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.660]   It just doesn't matter anything.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.860]   The only time someone could say, "I'm selling a house as is,"
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.460]   is if you have no contingencies
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.980]   and your earnest money deposit is so high
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.760]   that you would not want to back out of that deal.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.420]   Because you could always back out of a deal,
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.940]   you'll just forfeit the earnest money
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.460]   and the seller will get to keep it.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.180]   So let's say, Chris, you asked earlier,
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.660]   what if you just can't get contingencies?
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.260]   And all the things we've mentioned,
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.740]   you don't have any wiggle room.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.580]   Well, what if you just make
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.500]   your earnest money deposit really low?
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.260]   Like, all right, no contingency, short escrow,
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.100]   I'll give you everything you want,
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.300]   $3,000 earnest money deposit.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.740]   You find something you don't like in the house,
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.420]   worst case scenario, you lose three grand.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.420]   No one loves it, but it's better than closing on a house
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.580]   that has a bunch of problems.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.820]   So don't ever believe "as is."
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.380]   Rob and I bought a house together, actually.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.180]   And he got to see behind the scenes
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:26.460]   of I was working the negotiation through our realtor.
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.500]   So it was like me telling Rob to tell our realtor,
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.660]   "Hey, say this."
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:33.420]   And he saw some of the angles and the experience
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.540]   that when you've been through these escrows, you develop.
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.540]   Sellers always start off with a hard stance.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.140]   "I'm not taking less than three and a half million."
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.540]   And then three weeks, four weeks later,
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.580]   all of a sudden, three million
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.100]   is starting to look like a possibility.
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.460]   "I'm not giving them anything."
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.060]   Well, we get these inspection reports,
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.500]   and hey, your pool's got some issues,
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.860]   your landscaping has some issues,
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.220]   your roof has some issues.
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.420]   It's going to be $75,000 worth of work
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.660]   that needs to be done.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.620]   You give them a week or two of sweating that out,
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.540]   they start to think a little bit differently.
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.500]   And so oftentimes when you're the buyer,
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.540]   you want to gather as much as you can
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:04.940]   about what's wrong with this property,
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:07.380]   present it to the sellers, and then wait.
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.260]   Let them marinate in their worry
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.580]   that you're going to back out of the deal
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.180]   or you're going to find something else,
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.820]   and they're going to have to give you concessions.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.500]   The knee-jerk response is almost always, "No,
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.860]   I will not do it."
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:18.980]   But if you wait long enough,
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.300]   those nos frequently turn into yeses.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.500]   So when I'm listing a house,
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.940]   I will have my client pay for a home inspection,
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.980]   which they never like doing because they're 500 bucks,
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:30.820]   but it saves you so much money, Chris.
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.820]   You would ask for other hacks when you're in escrow.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.660]   Anytime there's a inspection that's done,
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.940]   the perspective is as crazy as this is,
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.980]   is the buyer's buying a house in perfect condition.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.220]   And if anything's wrong with it,
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.180]   they deserve a credit or they deserve repairs.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.500]   They deserve something to put this house back
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.820]   into perfect condition.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.700]   Frequently, the house is in much better shape
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:50.860]   than other houses in the neighborhood,
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.900]   but they still use that inspection to get a discount.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.500]   Short answer is if you are buying a house
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.940]   and it's not a situation where they have another buyer
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.740]   willing to pay more than you in backup position
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.060]   who's gonna jump right in there, anything absent that,
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.500]   you can ask for credits.
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.140]   You can get a significant chunk
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.300]   of your closing costs paid for by the seller.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.340]   If you wait long enough into the escrow before you ask,
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.140]   almost regardless of the condition of the home.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.720]   So when I'm selling houses,
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.280]   that's how I get people to waive the inspection contingency.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.180]   You're gonna get a home inspection paid for.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.900]   We're gonna give that to the buyer up front.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.220]   We're gonna say, "Here's what it looks like.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.060]   Here's all the reports.
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.700]   If you don't like it, find another house.
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:25.660]   But if you want this house,
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:26.500]   this is what you're buying
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:27.860]   and you're gonna waive those contingencies."
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.660]   So when you're selling, that's what you wanna do.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.140]   When you're buying, you wanna avoid it.
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.280]   And then one practical thing to look for
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.660]   that everybody misses
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.900]   is what we call the sewer lateral connection.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.700]   So there is a sewer line that runs from your home
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.100]   out to usually the sidewalk
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.500]   where it connects to the city sewer line.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:47.740]   Those plumbing lines, if it's an older home,
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.000]   usually running through the front yard,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.260]   can become infiltrated by tree roots.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.400]   This is a crazy thing.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   But when the roots are just pushing against that PVC pipe
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.460]   for years, they will eventually push through there
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.940]   and then the roots will grow
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.980]   and these sewer lines can become clogged
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.740]   and they're very expensive to fix.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.340]   So one thing I tell every home buyer who's trying,
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.180]   like, "What could I miss?
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:10.300]   What's that thing that I might've missed?"
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.660]   Get that sewer line scoped by a plumber
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.860]   before you buy the house, during your due diligence,
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:16.580]   and make sure that there aren't any clogs
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.660]   'cause those things can be 10, 15 grand a fix
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.500]   when they get messed up.
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.180]   - Yeah, that did happen to me.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.800]   We did a sewer scope.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.960]   There was a problem with the sewer.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.480]   They sent out the plumber to "fix the sewer."
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.320]   And we asked for the sewer scope
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.800]   like an hour before closing.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.400]   And they're like, "Oh, we didn't do one."
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.040]   But everyone's hands were sort of tied.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.480]   It was December 31st.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.280]   We were all trying to close that year.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.960]   It was gonna mess everybody up.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.040]   So we were just like, "All right.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.120]   Well, I mean, if they fixed it,
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.960]   then in theory we should be good."
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   My wife moved in with our two kids.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.560]   And then that week,
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.880]   ramen noodles and poop show up in our bathtub.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.600]   And it was a whole thing.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.160]   And so lawyers got involved and it was a whole thing.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.160]   And basically what happened was the seller's agent
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.720]   lied to us about the repair
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.400]   and basically never even told the plumber kind of thing.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.120]   And so because we didn't get it re-scoped
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.880]   and while we didn't do it while they owned it,
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.480]   it became a whole problem for us.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.720]   So I would say from a sewer scope standpoint,
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.040]   if you do have to make repairs,
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.920]   make sure you pay for two sewer scopes.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.480]   - What do you guys think about inspections
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.720]   when the seller's already done the inspections
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.880]   and they're in the disclosures?
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.280]   I remember when we bought this house,
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.120]   the disclosures were like,
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.680]   "Here's the building report.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.960]   Here's the roof inspection.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.360]   Here's the termite inspection."
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.680]   They were all there.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.000]   Do you still recommend people go do them themselves also?
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:33.880]   - Usually not.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.560]   The fear is, well, that's the seller's inspector.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.440]   But the inspectors themselves are licensed professionals
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.320]   that don't really care who the seller is,
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.160]   who the buyer is.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.360]   They just wanna make sure they don't miss anything
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.760]   so they don't get sued.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.800]   So what I tell my clients
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.880]   when you're getting inspections someone else has done
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.440]   is call the home inspector
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.720]   and ask them, you can actually do that,
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.600]   especially if you're the one who pays for the inspection.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:54.520]   But even if you're not,
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:59.400]   "Hey, I see in your inspection line 9C2 shows this.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.080]   Is that something I should be worried about?"
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.600]   You get great information from home inspectors.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.560]   They give you the context that's often missing,
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.680]   especially 'cause when you're first buying a house
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.080]   or even if you've owned a lot of houses,
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.000]   Rob, you could probably admit,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.640]   we don't know what a lot of that stuff means.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.200]   You see a report and it lists something,
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.320]   you're like, "Well, is that a bad thing
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.440]   or not a bad thing?"
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.400]   Just ask them, "Do you see this very frequently?
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.000]   Oh yeah, every house has that issue
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.920]   with the trusses in the attic or whatever the cases are."
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.560]   No, that's very concerning.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.040]   That electrical system should not be wired that way.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.680]   I rarely ever see that.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.040]   That's a big problem.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.920]   So having those conversations with the person
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   that inspected the house and then specifically asking,
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.800]   is this a common problem or is this concerning to you?
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.760]   Or maybe when you looked at the house,
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.480]   what stuff from this report stood out to you
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.320]   in your experience?
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:45.480]   Now you're getting 20 years of experience
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.840]   so that home inspector's perspective benefiting you
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.600]   as a person buying the house.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.680]   I'm gonna rapid fire through a few things quick
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.760]   that I've done in this part of the process.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.320]   One, we did get an inspection
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.640]   that said that there were termites.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.760]   I got another inspection and found someone
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.920]   that was willing to crawl through a smaller hole
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.680]   than the original inspector was
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.600]   to figure out what was wrong and find local treatment
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.760]   that was gonna be less expensive.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.440]   So I think anytime an inspection reveals something
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.480]   that could be expensive,
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.480]   it could be worth doing a second one.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.080]   Another one is, I'm trying to figure out
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.200]   when we're trying to buy a home,
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.960]   what the person cares about.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.560]   Because sometimes there's sellers
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:22.320]   that really just wanna close fast.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.920]   Some want the most money.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.080]   Sometimes someone might just wanna make sure
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.960]   that the house is gonna be taken care of by a good family.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.680]   I find that if I could figure that out,
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.000]   either through the agent or some other way,
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.480]   maybe from some neighbors.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.080]   Sometimes we ask the neighbors about the sellers.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.800]   You could try to optimize what you're doing.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.080]   'Cause if you know what's important to them,
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.720]   if they care about fast close,
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.440]   then maybe that's the thing you optimize for.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.360]   My brother-in-law's tip was always,
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.920]   it's a lot easier to extend a fast close than you think.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.640]   So if you say we're gonna close in 30 days,
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.680]   you need to push it back by day 30.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.000]   It's a lot easier.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.480]   I'm gonna throw a couple little things
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.960]   that I've thrown in contracts
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.120]   or learned and regretted not doing.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.440]   I'm curious if there are any last things
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.520]   that you try to negotiate for.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.480]   For me, I always had this rule when I bought a car
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.800]   that's like try to get them to throw in the floor mats.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.920]   And for the home,
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.760]   I always love getting a little extra at the end of the deal
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.160]   because you're looking at a house
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.520]   that the cost to throw in a few things is so small
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.880]   that even if someone's not willing to negotiate,
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.920]   you could sometimes get it.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.920]   So we got all the lime trees
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.520]   that were technically staging included in our house.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.720]   There was a nice stage TV in the living room.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:24.720]   We got that thrown in.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.880]   So I always like to throw in a little bit
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.080]   of few small things that at the end of the day,
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:32.160]   no one's gonna kind of blow a deal up over something small,
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.200]   but it feels really good.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.880]   Every time we walk through our living room,
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.240]   I'm like, I didn't pay for that TV.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.720]   Like that TV was free.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.720]   Yeah, I paid for the TV.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:39.560]   I bought the house,
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.800]   but I feel like I didn't pay for the TV.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   And one that I've recently come across.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.480]   So depending on how much you care about privacy and whatnot,
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.600]   I'm now in a situation
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.960]   where I'd prefer the whole world doesn't know where I live.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.080]   So one thing that you can do in advance,
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.560]   because it's a lot of work if you don't,
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.040]   is put into the contract
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:00.160]   that the agent needs to remove all of the home data,
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.800]   photos, descriptions from the MLS.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.240]   Sometimes it can be a hassle
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.160]   to get them to go do it after the fact.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.520]   But if you don't want all the pictures
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.280]   of the interior house online,
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.680]   you can write that into a contract,
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.760]   which is something that took me time,
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.680]   but I didn't do it in advance.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.440]   And if you really wanna be private
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.880]   and you wanna buy a home in an LLC
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.680]   so that you kind of protect your identity where you are,
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.840]   you can't do that later.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.360]   Like the records will always be there
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.600]   if you didn't do that in advance.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.280]   So if you're in a situation where you think one day
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.120]   in the near future,
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.440]   you might not want people to find your address,
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.240]   buy the home in the LLC in advance.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.560]   Don't try to change that after the fact.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:34.720]   'Cause I have at least one friend
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.920]   who ended up just having to move
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.800]   because someone knew where his address was
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.960]   and there wasn't really anything he could do at that point.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.160]   So those are a couple of mine.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.120]   Any other small, quick wins
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.680]   that you can get when you're negotiating?
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.800]   We talked about seller credits.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.280]   I think it's important to note
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.800]   that you can have a little bit of flexibility
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:50.720]   with seller credits.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.400]   Like let's say you can't see eye to eye with the seller
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.040]   and they don't wanna give you a $5,000 seller credit
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.800]   to repair this one kind of thing
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.520]   that you think is a big deal.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.400]   You could, in theory, raise the price by $5,000
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.000]   and then have them give you a credit for $5,000.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.480]   And while they're not paying it for you,
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.320]   throwing that onto your mortgage
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.200]   is really gonna have a pretty minimal effect
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.320]   on your overall payment.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.720]   I mean, probably less than a dollar is my guess.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:15.560]   I don't really know.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.160]   But that's always something you can do too
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.760]   if you need to make a deal work
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:19.600]   and you're really like,
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.120]   "Hey, this $5,000 is gonna kill the deal."
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.460]   You can always add it to the price of the house
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.160]   if you feel like you're getting a good enough deal.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.120]   That's a good strategy,
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.840]   especially if you don't have a ton of capital.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.640]   In general, having 5, 10, 15 grand in the bank
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.360]   is more value to you than having 5, 10, or 15 grand
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.320]   added onto a $600,000 mortgage balance.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.880]   When it comes to extras that you mentioned, Chris,
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.880]   one of the best things to do is to have your agent
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.120]   ask the listing agent,
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.560]   "Is there anything that the sellers
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.400]   don't wanna have to move?"
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.040]   You wouldn't think that would be a common thing,
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.880]   but many times, sellers, their biggest concern is,
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.680]   "I don't wanna move all my crap."
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.060]   And if they don't wanna take the bunk beds with them,
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.200]   or they have some patio furniture in the backyard
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.800]   that they were planning on replacing
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.880]   when they got something new,
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.600]   or they don't really love their couch,
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:03.800]   it's not worth moving
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.180]   because they're gonna have to spend a bunch of money
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.920]   to get it from one place to another,
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.240]   they may be happy to leave it for you.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.780]   So just getting a list from them,
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.540]   or what are all the things you don't wanna take
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:15.000]   regarding furniture or stuff like that,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.720]   is something that you can get added.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.080]   Like what you mentioned, Chris,
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.600]   sometimes there's TVs that they were just gonna get
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.240]   a new TV when they got to the new house,
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.800]   and you can have that added,
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.520]   and just end up with some extra things
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.600]   to throw throughout the house.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:28.780]   Doesn't hurt to ask.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:29.620]   - Love that.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.460]   Rob, you talked about mortgages.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:32.280]   Let's talk quickly about financing.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.620]   I know it's a big thing.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.320]   Anything people need to be thinking about
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.600]   as they go through this process,
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.080]   getting a loan, getting pre-qualified,
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.560]   figuring out what they can afford?
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.920]   - There's a couple ways to look at it, right?
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.280]   So if you're buying conventionally,
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.440]   they're typically gonna look at
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.560]   what's called your debt to income ratio.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.000]   So this is how much money you're paying
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.880]   every single month to debt servicers
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.560]   versus how much income you make.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.120]   Now, I believe this is gross income.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.000]   So let's say you make $10,000 a month,
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.800]   but all of your credit cards and your student loan payments
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.680]   and your car payments and the couch that you finance
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.820]   adds up to 4,500 bucks a month.
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:07.600]   That means that your debt to income ratio is 45%.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.200]   And David, you probably know the exact number here,
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.600]   but typically, lenders don't want you to have
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:16.220]   higher than a 45% DTI to make a deal work.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.920]   Is that the correct figure, David?
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:19.160]   - It's sometimes lower than that.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:21.600]   That's like the ceiling as high as most of them will go.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:22.440]   - Yeah.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.240]   So you wanna make sure that when you're analyzing a deal
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.900]   and seeing what you can qualify for,
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.680]   I mean, all lenders are basically gonna run
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.420]   this calculation for you.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:31.540]   But just to put it into perspective,
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.360]   you don't want the payment of the house that you're buying
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.960]   to throw your DTI out of whack, right?
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.760]   If you're barely qualifying now,
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.980]   the debt that you're gonna have
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:41.520]   from the house that you're buying
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:44.120]   contributes to that DTI and what you're qualifying for.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.980]   So make sure that that's something
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:48.200]   that you can hone in ahead of time.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.440]   And certainly don't go take out new credit cards
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.360]   and fill them up to buy new furniture before you close.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.680]   That's a big mistake that I think a lot of people make
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.340]   on their first property.
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:58.180]   - Yeah.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.020]   Opening any line of credit
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.840]   is gonna screw up your debt to income ratio.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.400]   And it often happens once the house is an escrow.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.060]   Now let's buy a new car to drive into our new garage.
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:08.200]   Let's go open a line of credits to buy a bunch of furniture.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.120]   You're so excited.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.200]   And then the entire escrow gets blown up
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.800]   because you were just at the peak
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.640]   of what you could afford
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.560]   if that new line of credit put you over.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.080]   - I'm a big fan of the points game
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:18.800]   and opening up cards and sign up bonuses.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:19.800]   But when we're buying a home,
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:23.240]   it's like, let's put a hold on all of that six months out
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.880]   just so I kind of have a nice clean slate there.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.000]   And I'm not trying to take on any extra inquiries
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.240]   or anything like that.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.680]   - When you're helping people find homes
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.160]   or looking for mortgages yourself,
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.240]   do you think a broker
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   is an important part of that equation or not?
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.520]   It's something I've never actually worked with.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.480]   I've always gone direct
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.440]   to a handful of financial institutions.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:43.000]   - Yeah, and disclaimer, I am a mortgage broker,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.940]   so I am partial towards them.
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:46.480]   But here's why I went that route
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.260]   instead of becoming what we call direct lender.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.200]   So what a lot of people do is they'll go to Wells Fargo,
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.840]   they'll go to Chase, they'll go to Bank of America,
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.080]   and they'll say, "What can you do?
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:54.920]   What's your rate?
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.740]   What are your closing costs?"
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.100]   And it gives you this feeling of productivity
[00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:58.780]   that you're out there shopping around.
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.040]   But as a broker, we're doing the same thing.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.960]   We're going to Bank of America, we're going to Chase,
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.940]   we're going to all the same lenders you have,
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.640]   but they're probably giving us better pricing than you.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.160]   And this is one of the shady things
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.840]   about how the loan industry works.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.600]   When you walk into Bank of America,
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.280]   'cause that's where you bank and you know them
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.640]   and you're comfortable with them,
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.320]   they know that you're gonna bank with them
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.200]   because you're comfortable.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.960]   They don't have to give you the best deal.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.840]   But when they're working with a broker,
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.440]   they know that we are comparing them
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.760]   to all the other lending options,
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.580]   so they're gonna have to give us a good deal
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.640]   to get the business.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.240]   So going to a broker, it will allow you to have them shop
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.640]   for all your different loan products
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.280]   and options that are available, save you time,
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.320]   and they're usually gonna get better pricing.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.680]   - Can a broker still get deals where they're required
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.760]   to put a certain amount of assets at that institution?
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.500]   I know, at least with Wells Fargo, as your example,
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.080]   if you move some money into a brokerage account
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.560]   with Wells Fargo, you get a better rate.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.280]   Do brokers still negotiate those kinds of deals as well?
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.800]   - Those are uncommon now.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.480]   We were seeing those with jumbo loans.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.080]   There was a time where you could get a better rate
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.440]   on a jumbo loan if you put a significant amount of money
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.720]   in with the bank.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.960]   And we would just tell our clients like,
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.200]   "Hey, if you're looking for a jumbo loan in this market,"
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.560]   it's not the case right now, but at the time,
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.960]   especially during COVID,
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.600]   you're better off just to go to that bank.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.720]   You're gonna get a better rate on jumbo products
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.560]   than you would be right here.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.680]   But you're gonna have to put 100 grand in a bank.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:13.900]   They're gonna schedule a meeting for you
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.200]   with one of their financial advisors
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.640]   'cause they want you to take that 100 grand
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.000]   and go buy mutual funds through them
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.740]   and they're gonna make money that way.
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.720]   So if you get an honest broker,
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.320]   we don't wanna waste our time working on somebody
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.040]   who we can't get them a good loan product.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.360]   We're pretty good at just telling people upfront,
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.240]   "For what you wanna do, we don't have a product like that."
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.120]   For years, we didn't do commercial lending.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.080]   So we would refer people
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.760]   to the best commercial lender we knew
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.520]   until we got set up with a commercial lender
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.340]   and now we can do it.
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:42.080]   So if you do have one of those special opportunities,
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.600]   sometimes physicians can get special loans
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.600]   through a credit union that is geared towards physicians.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.680]   Yes, there's an angle, but for your average person,
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.380]   there's not a ton of those opportunities.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:53.680]   - And David, just for reference,
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.240]   what makes something a jumbo loan?
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.240]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.000]   Every area has a difference,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.780]   what they call it like a conforming limit.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.060]   This is how much you can borrow
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.840]   before it's considered to be risky.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.100]   A mortgage broker or a loan officer can tell you
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.440]   what the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac guidelines are
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.260]   for that area.
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.960]   You might even be able to look that up online.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.080]   But a loan balance above a certain amount,
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.480]   it's obviously higher in the Bay Area, California,
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.680]   than it's gonna be in Topeka, Kansas.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.160]   But it's a proportional amount.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.780]   And then once you have to get a loan balance
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:22.620]   higher than that,
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.760]   you're not gonna get a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac loan,
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.240]   you're gonna get a loan that comes from private investors
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.640]   that have pooled their money in capital markets.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.640]   They're going to give you the loan,
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.600]   then they're going to sell that
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.280]   as a mortgage-backed security somewhere else.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.020]   So that's why the rates are usually a little bit higher
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:35.860]   on jumbo loans.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.760]   They're riskier for the person lending you the money.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.600]   - I think in the Bay Area,
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.520]   it's like high six figures is the threshold, I think.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.480]   - Yeah, it goes up every year, usually, too.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.360]   - Okay, yeah, it's been a few years for me.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.200]   And how do you think about
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.600]   how much people should be putting down?
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.680]   - I think it's gonna probably depend
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.160]   on the use case, right?
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.760]   So if it's a primary, you can get into a primary
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.920]   for as low as 3.5% down.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.100]   Unless it's a jumbo loan, I don't think you can do that.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.520]   There are limits on those as well,
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.000]   the FHA Fannie Mae guidelines.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.960]   So make sure to look those up.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.560]   Those are pretty easy to look up.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.400]   I think it's totally fine
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.680]   to get into your starter home for 3.5%.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.520]   I did.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:12.880]   I got into my first $159,000 house for like six or seven grand.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.480]   That house ended up being the catalyst
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.120]   for my entire portfolio.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.600]   I think if you're looking at investment properties,
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.560]   you could go as low as 10% with a second home loan.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.180]   That's still gonna be under your name
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.960]   and your income and everything like that.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.520]   And then once you go that traditional route,
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.880]   if you're going more traditional real estate,
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.680]   20% down seems to be the gold standard.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.680]   Sometimes it's gonna be asked that you do 25%.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.080]   Not really a fan of putting 25% down personally.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:42.600]   If I can get in for 10% on a second home loan, pretty happy.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.340]   I'll do 20% though on an investment loan.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:47.260]   That seems to be more common these days.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.720]   So I like to put that into an apples to apples comparison.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.680]   In general, if you're an investor
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.180]   or a real estate investor, having more capital is better,
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.500]   but it depends where interest rates are.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.720]   So for example, when rates are at 6%,
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.180]   to save an extra $40,000
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.600]   and put that towards your down payment
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.600]   is gonna save you $240 a month.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:12.600]   When rates were at 3%, it would only save you $169 a month.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.640]   So we saw this phenomenon
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.220]   where people were trying to save more money
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.360]   to get their payment lower, get their payment lower,
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.340]   but prices were rising faster than they could save money.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.940]   It actually ended up being a poor financial decision
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.300]   to try to save more money to put money down.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:30.020]   So if rates jump up to say 12%,
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.740]   now you're talking about $411 a month.
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.880]   That might make sense to put more money down,
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.060]   but interest rates, though, they're higher than they were.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:39.940]   They are still traditionally very low
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:41.620]   compared to where they've been for a long time.
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.660]   So putting more money down
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.660]   doesn't help you as much as you'd think.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:47.700]   Up to $750,000 of mortgage interest
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.820]   deductible as a primary residence.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.780]   So that mortgage interest comes off
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.940]   a little bit in your tax return.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.100]   Obviously, I'm not an accountant.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.820]   Feel free to talk to a CPA.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.860]   And then a hack for anyone who's making large purchases
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:01.700]   and has lots of money that isn't talked about too often,
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:04.740]   but I'll share on the personal side is that
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.960]   if you borrow money and you use that money to invest
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.700]   in anything, whether it's stock market, bonds, whatever,
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.180]   that interest is deductible as investment interest expense.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.460]   Again, not a CPA, talk to your lawyer.
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:17.780]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.660]   So I know people that have been able to buy a house in cash
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.900]   and then do the mortgage a day later,
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.980]   and then take that mortgage and invest it.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.740]   One thing we did to kind of do this strategy a little bit
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:33.620]   was we liquidated a lot of our personal investment savings,
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.780]   bought more of the house than we could,
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.540]   and then immediately financed more of it
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:40.420]   and put that money back in our investment account.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:41.700]   And by doing that,
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:45.120]   we could go over the deductible mortgage interest limit
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.220]   because that extra mortgage interest
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.780]   was actually being classified as investment interest
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.820]   because it was being used for the purpose of investing.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.440]   So I'm not gonna go down that rabbit hole,
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.660]   but I know people who have multi-million dollar mortgages
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:59.260]   that are 100% deductible.
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.260]   And you could deduct that interest against
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.100]   investment returns and investment gains,
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.740]   whether it's capital gains or interest income
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:05.740]   or anything like that.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.900]   There's also a ton of awesome tax hacks
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.540]   when it comes to commercial property.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.420]   I know you guys did an episode all about the way
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.960]   to do real estate and not pay taxes
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.860]   when you're doing it for investment properties.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.980]   I don't remember the episode number,
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.660]   but we'll link to it in the show notes for sure,
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:21.240]   because I know you guys have gone deep on that
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.140]   on the commercial side.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.860]   But there is a hack here if you have cash on hand,
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:28.140]   or even if your house is appreciated and you have equity,
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:31.300]   you can refinance, take cash out of your house.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.460]   And as long as you invest that cash out refinance money,
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:37.100]   that extra mortgage interest will also be,
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.660]   usually, talked to your CPA,
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:41.180]   classified as investment interest expense and be deductible.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.380]   Yeah, you can write off the interest
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.980]   and you don't get taxed on the money that you took out.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.940]   I will say, I actually remember the episode
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:47.820]   off the top of my head.
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.620]   I have every single episode memorized.
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:53.900]   It was 689, our BiggerPockets episode with Matt Bontrager,
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.820]   who is an awesome CPA.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.620]   So there's probably a lot more we could do.
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.500]   I could, in fact, probably do an entire episode
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.460]   on each one of these topics we went to.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.380]   Maybe that's the follow-up is we have a series
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.140]   of extra deeper, deeper dives on each one.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.860]   Any last things that you need to be thinking about?
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:08.900]   We made an offer.
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.340]   We secured our loan.
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:12.300]   As we're wrapping up the process of buying a home,
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.300]   is there anything else there?
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.940]   Or is it really just closes and that's all that happens?
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:18.380]   David, you gave a very good tip the other day
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.740]   about keeping your documents into one place.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:21.780]   You think you could run us through that?
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.900]   'Cause when you said it, I was like, "Oh my God."
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:24.740]   It's so easy.
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.860]   Why doesn't everyone do this
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.940]   before they apply for a mortgage?
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:28.780]   So when you're getting ready
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.220]   to buy a house in the first place,
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.100]   a lot of people hate the pre-approval process.
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:32.940]   It's like pulling teeth.
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.380]   You have to go get your pay stubs.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.820]   You have to get bank statements.
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.500]   You have to find your tax returns.
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.020]   Well, who knows where their tax returns are most of the time?
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.540]   And if you're not used to navigating
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.740]   your company's HR website to get pay stubs,
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.740]   it can take three hours to figure that thing out.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.100]   It's very frustrating.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.940]   So the advice that I give to all of our clients
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.700]   and what I do myself is I create a Google folder
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.420]   in Google Drive with that information.
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:57.260]   When I download those documents, I stick it in that folder.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.300]   And that way, if you decide that you wanna get pre-approved
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.220]   with several different lenders,
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:01.820]   if you're gonna use the method like Chris was saying,
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.060]   where you're talking to different people,
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.540]   you're sending the same stuff to everybody.
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:05.740]   It's really easy.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.300]   Then when I close on a house,
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.380]   I open another Google Drive folder for every address
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.180]   and I keep all the information
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.420]   for every house in that folder.
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.580]   It is incredibly simple when you do it.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.900]   So we get our loan documents.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.740]   I stick it in there.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.020]   All the inspection reports, I stick it in there.
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.420]   The disclosures for the house, they're gonna go in there.
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:25.980]   The mortgage note, every piece of information,
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:27.260]   the property management agreement,
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.540]   if I'm gonna manage the property,
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:29.980]   the work from the contractor,
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:32.020]   the scope of work and how much I paid them.
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.540]   Whatever it is, it all goes in that same folder.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.540]   And then if I ever need it,
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.060]   I know exactly where to go to get it.
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:37.900]   - I love that.
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:39.540]   I did not do that with the first house.
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.740]   And you had to go back and track down the mortgage docs.
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:44.100]   And I was surprised that just because you sign
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.820]   a lot of these mortgage docs in person,
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:48.260]   I didn't get a copy without requesting them
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:49.740]   as an attachment in my email.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:52.700]   It was in some secure thing that wasn't easy to access.
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:53.540]   That's one.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:54.820]   And then the last other thing I put in that folder.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.260]   So now I have that folder.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.980]   I would say, put a Google sheet in that folder,
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.060]   Excel file, whatever.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:02.780]   And every time you make any expenditures
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:05.420]   to improve the house, make sure you write it down.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.260]   Because we just did a renovation
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.020]   and that kind of sparked this idea.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.540]   But at the end of the tenure at a house,
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.380]   when you sell it,
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.500]   you take the amount that you made from the house selling it,
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.380]   you subtract the amount that you spent to buy it,
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:18.260]   and that's your kind of gain on the house.
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.020]   But you can deduct all the improvements
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:21.420]   you made to that house.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:23.700]   And so it might seem small at the beginning,
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.340]   maybe you just redid some floors,
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.620]   but those things add up over the life of the house.
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:28.740]   And I think it's really helpful
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.220]   if just right as soon as you close,
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.100]   you have one place you can start to track
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.340]   every improvement and every expense you put
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.500]   to improve that house,
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.740]   so that you can save on the taxes at the end.
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.220]   - And if you ever wanna sell that house,
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.260]   that's something you can show
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.620]   the next buyers of the property.
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:42.940]   Here's all the improvements that we made
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:45.300]   over the time we had the home and here's the receipts.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:46.940]   - Speaking of tracking all this stuff
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.100]   and storing documents,
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.500]   there's one thing after you buy this house
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:51.460]   that's very important,
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.180]   is to make sure you get that house insured.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:55.460]   I just did a really deep dive on insurance.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.140]   I went through every policy,
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.980]   talked to multiple brokers, multiple companies.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.820]   I tracked a lot.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.100]   I probably spent 50 hours on insurance.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.460]   And I wanted to share a few things.
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.260]   Any thoughts from you guys quick on insurance
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.380]   or should I jump in?
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:07.220]   - No, let's do it.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.140]   But I do wanna say I listened to it, dude.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.420]   I mean, it is clear you put 50 hours of research into it.
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:14.580]   And as the keeper of all the episodes,
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.540]   you can find that episode of All The Hacks.
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.060]   That's number 104.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:19.780]   So make sure to go listen to that
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:21.140]   after you listen to this.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.940]   Make that be the first thing you listen to
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.320]   'cause I promise you it will answer all of your questions
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.540]   as it pertains to homeowners insurance.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.380]   - And more.
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.220]   Anytime someone sends me an email on how much they saved
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.060]   after listening to that episode, I write it down.
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.660]   And the stack rank is currently at $14,000.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.340]   So if you listened to that episode
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.820]   and you save more than $14,000, absolutely reach out.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.660]   I wanna put you at the top of the leaderboard.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.540]   The goal is to save people as much as possible.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.620]   That's part of the theme of the show.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.740]   But one of the things that I think is really important
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.340]   is when we bought this home,
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.740]   the amount that we could insure the home for
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:53.100]   was not what I thought was an appropriate amount.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.280]   So there are multiple people that have a requirement.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.860]   The lender's gonna have some requirement
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:58.180]   that you insure the home enough.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.540]   The insurance company will.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:00.380]   But at the end of the day,
[01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:02.260]   that insurance is there to make sure
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.700]   that you can rebuild that home if something happens.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:08.100]   And I asked around from some real estate agents I knew
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.500]   how much it would cost to buy a teardown and build a house.
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.140]   And I asked a builder and the numbers they gave me
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:16.640]   were about 20% more than the cost estimator
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.380]   that the insurance company gave me.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.540]   And they were more than what our lender wanted us
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.080]   to have the home insured for.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.540]   So for me, I didn't wanna deal with that risk.
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:27.140]   So I actually just increased the coverage on the home.
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:29.180]   So my home is insured for more than
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:31.020]   the minimum that they required.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.540]   And one way to increase that total number
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.820]   that's cheaper than just insuring it for more
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.860]   is looking for extended reconstruction
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.020]   as an add-on to your policy.
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:44.300]   So that will cover you for anywhere from 25 to 100%
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.660]   of the cost of your home.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.340]   So if you have a home that's worth 500 grand
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.620]   and you insure it for 500 grand,
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:52.620]   but you add 50% extended reconstruction,
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.540]   up to 750 to repair it.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:58.060]   If building materials go up or something changes in the time,
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.020]   you'll get a little bit of an extra coverage there.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.540]   So I think that's something really important
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.020]   to think about as you go through that.
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:03.840]   - Yeah, that's really cool.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.060]   I never thought about that.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:08.580]   Insurance, it's becoming increasingly difficult to get
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.780]   and significantly more expensive.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.820]   I'm literally starting an insurance company right now
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:15.440]   because it has been so hard to find this.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.440]   And I didn't realize until I just bought a lot of real estate
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.220]   how bad it's getting in certain states.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.380]   There are certain areas where you're looking at homes
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:24.100]   that you will literally not be able to get insurance
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.460]   if you plan on making it a short-term rental.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.100]   Florida is notorious for this.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.500]   I had a quote on a property I bought in Florida
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.700]   that was $26,000 a year for an insurance policy.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.780]   I mean, that is a mortgage payment on a normal home
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:39.480]   and some California problems as well.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.580]   So in your due diligence process,
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.760]   we used to treat insurance like just an afterthought,
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.100]   like, oh yeah, yeah, my loan officer
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:46.020]   will connect me with someone.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.540]   I'll look at policies, I'll pick one.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:50.020]   No, you gotta make sure before you close on that house
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:52.620]   that you can get insurance and that it will be insured
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.700]   for as much as you will need if something goes wrong.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.100]   Great point there, Chris.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.820]   - Absolutely, Tahoe is another area like that
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.700]   where I know people who have very, very high costs.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.100]   And even in the Bay Area, because of the fires,
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.900]   there are a bunch of insurance carriers
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.200]   that just won't insure.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.980]   Travelers told me, "We can't insure your home."
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:09.220]   We're like, "We're not even in a real wildfire area,
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:10.740]   "but we're off their list."
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.540]   - Yeah, there's a BRRRR project that we're working on
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.880]   that we're gonna do a show on in the future.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.180]   We did one previously.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:17.660]   I could not get insurance for fire.
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:19.100]   I had to go through the state.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.380]   The state had to create its own insurance program
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.420]   because providers were not providing it to people.
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.180]   And you can't get a loan in most cases
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.940]   if you don't have fire insurance on a property.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.820]   So people don't talk about it very often,
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.760]   but it's a pretty significant problem that's going around.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.860]   I'm glad you brought it up.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:33.940]   - I'll give a couple quick ones,
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:35.360]   and then obviously check out this episode
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.620]   if you wanna go deep and save money on insurance.
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.780]   Bundling, not always the best deal.
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:40.620]   So a lot of people think,
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.860]   "Oh, I'm just gonna get my home insurance
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.900]   "with the same company that does my auto insurance."
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:47.480]   We found that many carriers, that was not the case.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.700]   And we probably looked at 15, 20 carriers.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:52.340]   So don't just assume that that's the right thing.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:54.180]   Also, don't just assume that your carrier
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.380]   that you've had for five years,
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.740]   because they have their,
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:58.660]   you've been a customer forever discount,
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:13:59.880]   is actually cheaper.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.060]   I found that to definitely not be the case in our situation.
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.220]   Also, don't forget that now you own a home,
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.720]   there's a chance that that home has,
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.800]   either now or in the future,
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.740]   increased your net worth enough
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:13.220]   that it might be worth looking at a umbrella policy
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.260]   that goes beyond the value of the home
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:16.420]   or your homeowner's insurance.
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.780]   And that will also extend to your auto insurance.
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.660]   There are a lot of people out there that buy a home,
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:21.860]   it appreciates over time,
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.780]   their net worth grows and grows and grows,
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.900]   and they're driving around
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:26.660]   and they haven't updated their auto policy,
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.500]   and they have $100,000 of liability insurance.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.580]   So get in a car accident,
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:32.740]   something happens terrible,
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.380]   and someone sues you for more than that.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:36.240]   Well, it turns out that you have more assets.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.860]   And if you don't have an umbrella policy
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.540]   to sit on top of your auto policy or your home policy,
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.680]   you could find yourself in a not great situation.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.820]   And there are some states where you're even able
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.740]   to sue someone for their future earnings.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:47.660]   We're talking about real estate,
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.940]   we're talking about building wealth.
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.780]   As you cross that threshold to,
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:52.560]   now I'm starting to build my wealth,
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.780]   I think it's equally as important to protect that wealth.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:57.860]   So that's something that it's very inexpensive.
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:01.300]   We're talking $100, depending on how much you need
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:04.300]   to protect yourself up to like a million dollars a year.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.100]   I think it's something people should be considering.
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.360]   And then last, you buy this home,
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.620]   after you've moved in,
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.700]   go around the house with a camera or your phone
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.480]   and just take a video of everything in the room
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.620]   and just document all the stuff you own,
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:18.180]   because it's gonna save you a ridiculous amount of time
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.960]   if anything were to happen, burn down, burglary.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.740]   You probably didn't save the receipts
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:23.820]   for everything you own.
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:27.580]   So take five minutes, make your own MTV crib style video
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:29.780]   running around, sharing everything in your house
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:31.260]   just in case, so you have that on hand.
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.940]   I think that's pretty important as well.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:34.620]   - I've had to go through that process before
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.380]   and I did not do that.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:38.220]   Gosh, it was horrible.
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.300]   It was horrible.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:42.140]   And you gotta show receipts and you gotta show photos
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.260]   and you gotta look through thousands of photos
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:48.280]   on your camera roll for some random angle of your house.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.020]   - Yeah, try to find that family picture you took
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:52.500]   with the flat screen in the background.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.380]   Yeah, just walk through, make that video.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:55.380]   I got a bunch of other tips,
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:57.600]   but we've been doing a lot in this episode.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.620]   And I think anyone who's looking to buy a home
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.820]   is absolutely going to be able to get a better deal,
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:04.060]   find a better home, find the right home
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.920]   and get through that process easier.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.260]   This has been so helpful.
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.940]   I'm so glad we got to do this episode.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.840]   I feel like there's more things we could break down,
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.580]   but at this point, I feel like this is a good stopping point.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:16.740]   Is there any last bits of wisdom that you guys wanna share
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:19.420]   to anyone thinking about going through this process?
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:20.580]   - Yeah, there's a thing that I mentioned
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:21.400]   to a lot of people who say,
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.860]   "I don't wanna be a real estate investor,"
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.060]   or, "Renting is cheaper than owning."
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:26.080]   It often is.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.580]   In most cases, if you buy a home,
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.700]   the mortgage is gonna be more than the rent in year one.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.740]   But go back to what rents were five years ago,
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.920]   10 years ago.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.620]   Are you telling me that the mortgages from 10 years ago
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:38.620]   are more expensive than rents today?
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.060]   It's hardly ever the case.
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.060]   So when you take the longer term approach,
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.500]   even if you're not a real estate investor,
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.360]   looking to rent out a property,
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.380]   buying a home and locking in a mortgage,
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:49.140]   especially with all the inflation we have,
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.980]   will always be cheaper for you in the long run.
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.980]   If you look at what your parents are paying on the house
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:57.380]   that they bought 25 years ago, those payments are laughable,
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:58.340]   but at the time they bought it,
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.420]   they thought it was expensive.
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:00.460]   So I often tell people,
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:03.980]   even if they don't wanna be a "real estate investor,"
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:06.180]   you should still buy a house
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:08.160]   and make sure that you've taken control
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.140]   of your financial future.
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.660]   You're not in the hands of landlords
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:12.420]   that can raise rent every year.
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.020]   My only caveat there would be,
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.260]   given the fees that you pay to an agent
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:17.480]   when you're selling the house
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.500]   and to the buyer's agent as well,
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.340]   if you're gonna buy a home
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.660]   and you're gonna be there for a year or two,
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:22.740]   you might not make money
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.540]   if you plan on selling it in a year or two,
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.540]   given the fees that are associated with that process.
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.300]   However, my advice,
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.700]   and this will lead us to an episode on both of our shows
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.180]   about house hacking, is there are ways,
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.520]   if you think, "Gosh, I can only really afford
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.960]   "a two-bedroom house, but we're about to start a family
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.740]   "and we're gonna need a bigger house in a few years.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.040]   "What do I do?"
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.900]   There are ways to buy the four-bedroom house
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.620]   or the duplex that you might one day need
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.180]   for your whole family or something like that now.
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.660]   Use tactics that you guys have talked about,
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.100]   we've talked about in multiple episodes
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.800]   that we'll link in the show notes on house hacking,
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.100]   to be able to get that house
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:56.900]   that two, three, four, five years from now
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.860]   is the house you want and get it earlier.
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:01.340]   Increase some cashflow from it
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.460]   so you can afford it for those next three or four years
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:05.380]   while it's more space than you need.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.060]   And I think that ends up allowing you
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:09.900]   to buy your 10, 15, 20, 30-year home
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:11.940]   before you're ready for all that space.
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:15.160]   And not be in a situation where you either can't buy the home
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.200]   or you've got to buy a home and sell it in a few years.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.040]   So we've both done episodes on it.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.820]   There's a number of tactics there.
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:24.200]   I think you can even use that income from your house hack
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.000]   to end up qualifying for income on your DTI
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   for your mortgage.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.760]   So I think there's some really great stuff there.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.360]   Obviously, we've both done episodes on it,
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.240]   but there's a lot of stuff there.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.440]   We did that in San Francisco
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.200]   and that helped us buy a three-bedroom place
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.280]   when we really only needed a one-bedroom.
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.120]   I will always thank house hacking for giving me my start.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.920]   It is the catalyst for all wealth and real estate,
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.100]   my deep, deep belief.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.640]   So yes, go listen to both those episodes.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.360]   If you were closed off to the idea,
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.220]   I promise after you listen to them,
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:52.600]   you're gonna be all in.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.120]   - Awesome, this has been fantastic.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.440]   I guess thank you for being here.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.640]   Thank you for having me here.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.060]   Thanks for doing this kind of fun episode.
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.480]   And I hope we get to have a conversation
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.780]   like this again soon.
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.120]   - Chris, for people in our audience

[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.460]   So if you like optimizing real estate,

[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.040]   which is if you're listening to this on all the hacks,
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.480]   go check out the BiggerPockets Real Estate Podcast.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.720]   - Well, that goes without saying.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.840]   I mean, yeah, if you like this stuff.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.600]   - Of course, I just, you know, gotta remind everybody.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.000]   - Yeah, we've got almost 800 episodes of content
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.720]   just like this if you wanna learn
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.640]   how to make money through real estate.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.320]   And Chris, I will say, I have a book coming out
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.600]   through BiggerPockets Publishing in October
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.320]   that's gonna be called "Pillars of Wealth,"
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.880]   and it's all about saving money, making money,
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:33.880]   and investing the difference.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.640]   And so much of what you've talked about,
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.640]   I echo the sentiments in that book.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:40.000]   It is incredibly important to be a wise steward
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.240]   of your resources if there's ways you can save money
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.120]   through credit card hacking, travel hacking,
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.040]   food hacking, everything.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.200]   Like, take advantage of that.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.240]   The people who manage their money well
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:52.000]   tend to be rewarded by the money gods who bring more.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.360]   So I love what you're doing.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.200]   Thank you for doing it.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.160]   I'm glad our audience got to hear about it.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.000]   - I'm glad I'm here.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.160]   And I like what you're talking about
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.600]   because building wealth is not always
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.280]   about sacrificing everything.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.120]   My goal is to help people live a life
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.760]   they really wanna live, just live it for less.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.240]   And on that note, there's an episode,
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.520]   I think everyone listening on the BiggerPocket side
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:09.360]   should check out.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.600]   I did this episode with Bill Perkins,
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.360]   who wrote a book called "Die With Zero."
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.400]   And it's radically reframed my perspective
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.640]   on basically all things wealth,
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.680]   spending money and everything.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.440]   I really wanted to focus on what's important,
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.160]   maximizing my net fulfillment,
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.800]   not necessarily my net worth.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.320]   And so if I leave people with,
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:27.800]   obviously, if you wanna optimize your insurance
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.640]   and save money, go there.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:31.360]   If you wanna travel for free, where's episodes there.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.920]   But if you wanna just kind of like
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.240]   really kick your entire perspective on money around
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.000]   and think about whether there's maybe a new way
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.440]   you might wanna be thinking about how you spend and save,
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.240]   episode 91 with Bill Perkins literally changed my life.
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.360]   It's the only episode I've done
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.440]   where I think I've listened to it five or six times.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.400]   - Nice, okay.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.080]   Yeah, I'm gonna go listen to that
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.520]   since I need something to listen to
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:53.320]   after episode 104, insurance, baby.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.040]   - Yeah, that's awesome, exactly.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:58.480]   - Wow, we covered so much in that episode.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.960]   So I really hope it was helpful
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.160]   and that you keep it bookmarked
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.640]   for the next time you might need it
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.520]   or if anyone you know is going through
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.880]   the process of buying a home,
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.560]   there is no higher compliment
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.440]   or way you could support me in the show
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.000]   than by sharing it with them.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.720]   And as I said before, if you have any other hacks,
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.760]   tips, or tactics for buying a home,
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.520]   please share them with me, podcast@allthehacks.com
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.480]   so I can share them with everyone else in a future episode.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.400]   And if you wanna learn more about real estate,
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.960]   definitely don't forget to go check out
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.080]   the BiggerPockets Real Estate Podcast.

[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.480]   (upbeat music)
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.760]   (upbeat music fades)
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:39.840]   (upbeat music fades)
