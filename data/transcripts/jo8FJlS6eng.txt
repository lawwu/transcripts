[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840]   Now, we have been working our way rather methodically and slowly through the book of Ephesians, and
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.560]   so we'll go back there this morning.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.880]   Would you turn in your Bible to Ephesians, chapter 5?
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.280]   We ended up last week at chapter 5, verse 7, and so we will pick up the text at verse
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.920]   8.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:38.440]   And I want to read this section from Ephesians 5:8 through 14 as the setting for the message
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440]   today.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:48.240]   Ephesians 5, starting at verse 8: "For you were formerly darkness, but now you are light
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.120]   in the Lord.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.420]   Walk as children of light, for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.420]   and truth."
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.760]   "crying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.740]   Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.420]   for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.960]   But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light; for everything that
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.540]   becomes visible is light.
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:35.040]   For this reason it says, 'Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.000]   upon you.'"
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.460]   Now the text compares light and darkness obviously.
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.700]   There are essentially two commands.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.440]   One is a positive command in verse 8, "Walk as children of light."
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.780]   The second is a negative command in verse 11, "Do not participate in the unfruitful
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.280]   deeds of darkness."
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.460]   So darkness and light are set against each other.
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.040]   Now the context for this, as you well know, began in chapter 4 as we began to look at
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.900]   the practical instruction of the Spirit of God through the apostle Paul for living the
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.040]   Christian life, for walking through the world in a way that honors the Lord.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.880]   And we have talked about walking worthy.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.720]   We have talked about walking in unity.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.280]   We have talked about walking in purity, walking in integrity, last time walking in love.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:46.200]   And now we have come to walking in light, just another way to perceive the life of the
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   believer.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.680]   "You were darkness.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.760]   You were darkness formerly," verse 8 says.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   "But now you are light."
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.660]   This is a stark contrast.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:08.100]   They are mutually exclusive, and that is why the Lord has chosen by His Spirit this particular
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.100]   analogy.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:18.360]   It is the best figure to show the complete separation of the non-Christian from the Christian,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.160]   the complete separation of the child of Satan from the child of God.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.640]   One is darkness.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.520]   One is light.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:37.880]   And the contrast is extreme to show the difference and the distinction and the opposite nature
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.980]   between Christians and non-Christians.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.980]   The darkness of this world is deep.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.240]   It is a profound darkness.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.120]   It is an ever-increasing darkness.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.140]   It is a deep blackness.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.520]   It is a spiritual black hole engulfing the world and into which the world plunges.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.820]   It is a deep blackness.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.040]   It is a deep blackness.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.040]   It is a deep blackness.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040]   And it is a dark blackness.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   It is a deep blackness.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   It is a deep blackness.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   It is a deep blackness.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.040]   And it is a deep blackness.

[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.040]   And it is a deep blackness.

[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   And it is a deep blackness.

[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   And it is a deep blackness.

[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.040]   And it is a deep blackness.

[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   And it is a deep blackness.

[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.040]   And it is a deep blackness.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:46.360]   Once men are set free to fulfill their lusts, immediately there are victims.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.900]   And the first victims are women.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.920]   Women are victims in two ways.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:19:01.680]   Women are victims actively because they become useful to men only for self-gratification.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.020]   Women become abused by men in a self-gratifying state.
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.360]   Sexual way.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:18.400]   But they are also passively abused because men who live like that shirk all real responsibility
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.300]   designed by God to care for women.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:31.920]   Corrupt fathers abuse women for their own pleasure, and they become a toxic masculinity,
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.000]   if you could even call it masculinity.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.240]   They abuse women for their pleasure.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.220]   Women become victims of their desires.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.820]   They use women.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:52.900]   They use them for the expression of their evil, and they use them to take place in a
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:20:00.180]   family or in a relationship that should belong to the man by ignoring their own fatherly
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.020]   responsibility.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.980]   What is a father by God's design?
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:18.220]   Fathers are designed by God to love, to lead, to feed, to provide, to protect, to instruct,
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:28.420]   to empower, to discipline, to sacrifice, and to suffer for the love of wife and children.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.540]   Let me go over that again.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.960]   God designed men, fathers, to love, lead, feed, provide, protect, and to serve.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:44.820]   protect, instruct, empower, discipline, sacrifice, and suffer for the love of wife and children."
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:53.960]   When they decide to live only for their own lusts, everything goes wrong.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.280]   Women are abused.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:03.600]   Children are therefore abused, as the family completely disintegrates.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:13.680]   The abused women turn to resent the abuse, and so you have a responding hardness that
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:20.400]   comes on women who were designed by God to be tender and compassionate and caring wives
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   and mothers.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.480]   They grow hard.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.620]   They grow callous.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.480]   They grow vengeful, and they attack back.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.240]   So you have essentially the same thing.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:41.780]   You have the conflict between unfaithful men and abused women, which destroys the family
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:48.080]   and, of course, the children and the whole society.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.160]   Destroy fathers, and you destroy an entire society.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:59.000]   When the moral character of true manhood, true fatherhood is gone, women and children
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.880]   are threatened, hardened, exposed to abuse.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:13.180]   And eventually, they become angry, and they turn on the men who abuse them categorically.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.080]   Now the results of this are tragic in our generation.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.060]   I mean, we see it.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:26.260]   Just for example, statistically, the United States is number one in the world in the number
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.560]   of fatherless children, that is, children who live in a home with no father - 25 million
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.560]   currently.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.520]   That's a lot.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:39.760]   85 percent of youth with severe behavioral issues had no father in the home.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:46.280]   75 percent of youth with drug and alcohol treatment histories had no father in the home.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.760]   90 percent of youth runaways and homeless had no father in the home.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.680]   85 percent of youth in prison had no father in the home.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:02.160]   And nearly half of all children born in this country now are born outside of marriage.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.200]   And they are five times more likely to be poor and nine times more likely to drop out
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.440]   of school.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.600]   We all know the fallout of this.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.500]   They don't know what a man's role is.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:27.140]   One of the reasons that you see all the civil unrest, all the damage, all these people in
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.200]   the streets doing destructive things.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:39.420]   It's because fathers teach their children how to suffer well.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:47.280]   Fatherless children don't think they should have to suffer, and so they revolt.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:53.800]   Fathers teach their children that life is hard and challenging, and you need to suffer
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   well.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.840]   And as we read this morning, if you suffer well, it develops your moral character.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:05.020]   It develops your character, your perseverance, and your hope.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:10.820]   But if you never learn to suffer well, then you hate all the sources of your suffering,
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:17.360]   and you blame it on some systemic social problem rather than accepting responsibility for the
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.180]   fact that life is hard.
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:28.880]   And if you take responsibility for it, you can rise above it if you are thoughtful.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.460]   It's not that fathers teach their kids to be criminals.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:43.180]   It's that fathers don't teach their children how to suffer difficulty, and so they burn
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:48.800]   things and tear things down and destroy things and kill people.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.840]   The fallout of this is devastating.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:57.060]   You would think the culture would wake up and understand that they have to change things,
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.200]   but instead of that, 60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:58.280]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:58.360]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:58.440]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:58.500]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:58.560]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:58.600]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:58.640]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:58.700]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:58.760]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:58.860]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:58.920]   60% of the world is going to be like that.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:07.660]   65% of Americans recently surveyed are okay with babies born outside marriage, which means
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.780]   you've got a fatherless home and a wife with no husband.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:22.500]   65% of people in America are okay with abortion, and you can throw this in.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.940]   66% are okay with homosexuality.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.500]   Homosexuality.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:28.520]   Homosexuality.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.860]   society is the ultimate perversion of manhood.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:39.320]   It is the ultimate perversion of manhood, and it is, by the way, the end of society.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:51.320]   When I say the West has fallen, I say it particularly because in 2003 the United States legalized
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   sodomy.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.860]   In 2015 they legalized homosexual marriage.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:07.740]   And here we are in 2022 featuring the ultimate degradation of homosexuality, which is drag
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:21.060]   queens in elementary schools, grooming kids to be as perverted as a male could possibly
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.200]   be.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   And the government is demanding acceptance for these people.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.080]   And the government is demanding acceptance for these people.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.540]   If not making them the priority.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:36.400]   Where you have homosexuality, you have the end of a culture.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.540]   When it is legalized the way it has been in this country, when it is normalized so that
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:50.740]   they can be married, and when it is praised and elevated, you know the culture has fallen.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.740]   So where are we?
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.040]   We're where we were before the light arrived.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.540]   We're back in Greece and Rome.
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.540]   We're back in Greece and Rome.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.660]   We're back in Greece and Rome.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:04.780]   The Greek and Roman culture was literally steeped in deviant homosexuality.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:12.860]   They had gymnasiums from the Greek word gumnos , which means "naked," only for men, and they
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:17.820]   participated in whatever they were doing naked.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:24.880]   It was marked by debauchery, homosexuality, cross-dressing, every bizarre, unimaginable
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.740]   thing.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.660]   There were catamites.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.420]   There was pederasty, as it's called.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.420]   You can look those up.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:38.080]   It was the worst of the worst, and it brought about the end of the Roman Empire, the Greek
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.840]   Empire.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:46.620]   The fall was profoundly complete.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.120]   We're in the same place, the same place.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.600]   This is not new.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.000]   This is paganism.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.460]   Pre-Christian paganism.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:03.760]   So now we're in post-Christian paganism.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:09.140]   How do we get out of this without fathers?
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:15.160]   Kevin Swanson has written a marvelous book called "Epoch," E-P-O-C-H.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.620]   Highly recommend it, subtitled "The Rise and Fall of the West."
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.860]   Let me read you just one paragraph.
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:29.620]   "Over sixty years, the pornography revolution has ruined the American male, ruined modern
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.920]   sexual life, and ruined marriage.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:41.420]   Pornography enabled mass isolation, depersonalization of sexuality and homosexuality by the accommodation
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.200]   of self-gratification.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:51.660]   It was electronic technology which mass produced and fast-tracked the dry rot to disintegrate
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.160]   human society in the modern world.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:00.240]   Electronic access to pornography was constant and omnipresent after the smartphone was released
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.720]   in 2011.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.960]   Children were corrupted by this technology as readily as the Greeks had accomplished
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.340]   the same feat with their own children in the gymnasiums.
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:19.680]   On average, a child first encountered pornography around eleven years of age, and 94% of children
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.460]   were viewing porn as a form of sexual abuse.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.480]   The average age of a child was about 14 years of age.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:32.180]   By 2019, 95% of teens 13 to 17 had full access to a smartphone and pornography, and almost
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.140]   half of them admitted to constantly being on the Internet.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:43.660]   Eighty percent of American men 18 to 30 were addicted to pornography, admitting to regular
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.660]   use.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:51.260]   Overall, Americans increased their participation in pornography from 20 percent to 65 percent
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:55.260]   between 1970 and 2019.
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:00.580]   The sheer number of men, boys, and families ruined by this electronic and demonic scourge
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.080]   would be impossible to figure.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:09.980]   All that was left to assess was lying in the ashes of Western civilization.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.440]   That's where we are.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:20.060]   And Satan has done it by attacking the fathers relentlessly, and it can't get worse than
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.060]   it is.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.380]   It doesn't go beyond being a drag queen.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:32.380]   It doesn't go beyond putting a drag queen in an elementary school.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.440]   That is perversity beyond comprehension.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.700]   So that's the darkness.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.220]   That is the present darkness.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:50.860]   And now going back to the text of Scripture, I hope that will help you understand what
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:58.440]   means that we are to have nothing to do with the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but we are
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.560]   to walk as children of light.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.300]   So let's look at this text.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:14.280]   First of all, you see a contrast in verse 8, a contrast: "For you were formerly darkness,
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.540]   but now you are light in the Lord."
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.660]   You were formerly darkness.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.160]   Now you are light in the Lord.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:30.100]   The verb "were" is emphatic: "you were."
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:36.680]   If you go back to chapter 2 of Ephesians in verse 1, "You were dead in your trespasses
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.680]   and sins."
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.780]   I said the darkness speaks of depravity.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.700]   "In which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:50.460]   prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience."
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:32:02.140]   You not only were depraved and dead, but you were deceived by the prince of the power
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:07.840]   of the air, the spirit now working in the sons of disobedience.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.420]   You were also dead in your trespasses and sin.
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:17.520]   Verse 3 says, "You lived in the lust of the flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.260]   and of the mind, and were by nature children of the Lord."
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:25.840]   Children of wrath, which speaks of the coming destruction.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:31.720]   All four elements of the darkness are indicated right there in that verse.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.140]   You were that.
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:42.260]   In chapter 4 and verse 17, "You walked in futility of mind."
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.120]   Verse 18, "You were darkened in your understanding.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.060]   You were excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in all
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.060]   unbelievers.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.460]   You were marked by hardness of heart."
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:58.880]   Verse 19, "Calous, given over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.240]   with greediness."
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.380]   You were.
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:08.820]   But please notice, it doesn't say you were formerly in darkness.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:12.940]   It says you were formerly darkness.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:19.860]   The darkness is the composite accumulation of all the dark people.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.780]   It's not that you're in the darkness as a victim.
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.620]   You're in the darkness as a contributor.
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.240]   You are the darkness.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.680]   Apart from Christ, you are the darkness.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.360]   You are a contributor.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:41.920]   You are a perpetrator.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.940]   Proverbs 4:19 says, "The way of the wicked is darkness.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.960]   They know not at what they stumble."
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.660]   That, of course, is Proverbs 4:19.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.760]   That's just part of the deception.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:57.020]   Second Corinthians 4:4 says, "The God of this age has blinded the minds of them that believe
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.020]   not."
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:02.380]   You are blinded by Satan.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:07.180]   You're blinded by the darkness of sin.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.860]   The darkness is a system.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.020]   It is a realm.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.180]   It is a kingdom.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:15.160]   It is a domain of unbelievers.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:19.460]   But the darkness is not separate from those unbelievers.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.820]   You are the darkness.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.480]   You if you're a believer, you were the darkness.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.840]   You were part of the darkness.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:34.020]   You made the darkness dark.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:38.580]   It's not that you were a victim of it.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.880]   You were the darkness.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.700]   You were the darkness.
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.260]   And verse 3, if you go back in chapter 5 to verse 3, "Your life was marked by immorality."
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:53.240]   Immorality, impurity, greed.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:58.460]   Verse 4, filthiness, silly talk.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:06.060]   Verse 5, immorality, impurity, covetousness.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.840]   You were the darkness.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.180]   You were not a victim.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:15.020]   You were the darkness.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.120]   Your works were unrighteous.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.060]   Your thoughts were unrighteous.
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:27.920]   Your thoughts were godless, and you were under divine judgment.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:33.380]   You were under the control of Satan, who in Luke 22:53 is called - Satan's title is "the
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.980]   power of darkness."
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:43.640]   You were the darkness empowered by Satan, and you were headed in your depravity and
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.860]   your deception toward death, already spiritually dead.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:55.980]   You were headed toward death and then destruction.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:36:05.820]   And Jude describes that destruction as "black darkness forever," which doesn't mean that
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.420]   hell isn't going to have any lights.
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:17.660]   What it means is the darkness has come to hell in the form of the people who came to
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.660]   hell.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.420]   You are the darkness.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.820]   You carry the darkness to hell.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:31.340]   The darkness of hell is the composite of all the dark people who make up that place where
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:39.460]   there are chains of darkness, black darkness forever.
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:44.400]   We were once all darkness.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.460]   But - back to verse 8, the contrast - "Now you are light in the Lord."
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.220]   But now everything has changed.
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:59.360]   "Now you are light in the Lord through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:05.140]   Because of Him we have been transferred from the darkness.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:10.080]   We have been transferred from darkness to light."
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:17.300]   Matthew 5:14, "You are the light of the world."
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.260]   What an incredible transformation.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:31.300]   Again, the extreme between darkness and light shows the extreme transformation of salvation.
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.980]   So there is a contrast.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.520]   And then there are characteristics.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.600]   So he says, "You are now light in the Lord."
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.140]   You are light.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.740]   You are light in the world.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:48.060]   You are the lights that light the darkness of corruption.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.680]   And then there is the contrast.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.720]   He says, "You are the light."
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.380]   He says, "You are the light."
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:51.860]   You're not just in the light, but you are the light.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:52.060]   "You are the light."
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.400]   He says, "You are the light."
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.680]   He says, "You are the light."
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:01.940]   Therefore, walk as children of light.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.540]   Walk again consistently.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:10.380]   Walk worthy of your calling, to borrow the language of chapter 4, verse 1.
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.040]   So what would that mean?
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.340]   What does it mean to walk as children of light?
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.100]   Well, verse 9 gives us the characteristics.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:17.860]   So we go from a light to a light.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.380]   We go from a contrast to characteristics.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:29.100]   The fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:35.540]   So those are the things that mark the light: goodness, righteousness, and truth.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:41.640]   And that parallels chapter 4, verse 24, that when you put on the new self, which in the
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:47.660]   likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness and truth.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:55.060]   Righteousness, holiness, and truth, or goodness, righteousness, and truth, same thing.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:39:11.600]   So if you're a child of the light, your life will be marked by all goodness, all righteousness,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.520]   and all truth.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.520]   What is goodness?
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.520]   Agathos.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.460]   That's the name of your great grandmother.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.220]   Your great-grandma, maybe.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:21.220]   Agatha.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.120]   Agathos.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.120]   There is kalos.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:30.660]   That's a word for Greek, and it means good to look at, free from defects.
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:34.220]   There's krestos, which means it's something useful.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:40.800]   But this is agathos, which means morally good from the divine perspective.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.340]   So how do you know when a person is a believer?
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.260]   Because they are people of light, and the light shows up.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:52.860]   The light shows up in their goodness, in their goodness.
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:58.780]   First Thessalonians 5:15 gives you an illustration: "See that no one repays another with evil
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:04.780]   for evil, but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all people."
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.380]   That's the same word.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.960]   It's just general goodness.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:15.060]   There's an opposite, an antonym back in verse 31 of chapter 4, malus.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.060]   Malus is kakia.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.820]   It's general evil.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.840]   Agathos is general good.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:27.520]   So if you have become a child of the light, you're marked by goodness.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.740]   Secondly, by righteousness.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:35.740]   That is, you walk a path that doesn't deviate from purity.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.540]   You're also marked by truth.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.500]   No longer are you deceived.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:46.520]   No longer are you marked by all the expressions of depravity.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:46.860]   You walk in it.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:47.720]   You walk in integrity.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.900]   You walk in honesty.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.820]   You walk in reliability.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:58.140]   You walk in trustworthiness in contrast to the shallow hypocrisy and falseness of those
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.340]   in the dark.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:04.360]   Colossians 1:10 elucidates that a bit.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:10.000]   Listen to these words: "So that you walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.240]   in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work."
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.660]   So it's all goodness.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.000]   All righteousness.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.880]   And all truth.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.980]   That's the fruit of the light.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:34.180]   Romans 13, I can't resist a few verses there, starting in verse 12: "The night is almost
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:37.300]   gone, and the day is near.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.580]   Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light."
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.460]   Arm yourself with light, and don't do the deeds of the darkness.
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.660]   You are the light.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.660]   You're in the light.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.980]   You are the light.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.780]   Don't do the deeds of the darkness.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.780]   What does that mean?
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:42:00.980]   Verse 13: "Let us behave properly as in the day."
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:07.380]   In other words, in the day simply means with the light full on, with everything exposed.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:14.860]   Not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.260]   jealousy.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:23.020]   But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh in regards to its
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.280]   lusts.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.880]   You make no provision for the flesh.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:33.840]   Obviously, that's what the philosophers of the Middle Ages wanted to overturn.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.100]   We make no provision for the flesh.
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:42.900]   All we want to know is the will of God, and that's what it says in verse 10: "Trying to
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.060]   learn what is pleasing to the Lord."
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:53.100]   The Christian walks as a child of light, producing the fruit of light, which is goodness, righteousness,
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:43:03.580]   and truth, and is a living example of someone learning what is pleasing to the Lord.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:07.180]   That's what it means to walk in light.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:10.640]   Look, you are in the light.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.860]   You can't hide anything.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.860]   You can't.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.860]   You can't hide anything.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.860]   The Lord knows.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:21.020]   He sees.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:26.480]   Your determination should be very simple: "My life is an open book.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:34.320]   I have nothing to hide because I'm governed by a determination to find out what is pleasing
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:41.760]   to the Lord and do it."
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.660]   This answers the question: "How do I know if I'm a child of God?"
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.660]   Don't speculate.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:47.660]   Don't speculate.
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:58.300]   Don't look past into the hinterlands of your experience years back and say, "Well, I once
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.040]   prayed a prayer."
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.480]   Look at your life.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:08.060]   Is it marked by all goodness, all righteousness, all truth?
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:12.660]   And are you ever learning what is pleasing to the Lord so you can do it?
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660]   "I have nothing to hide."
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.660]   "I have nothing to hide."
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.660]   "I have nothing to hide."
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.660]   "I have nothing to hide."
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:17.660]   "I have nothing to hide."
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.660]   "I have nothing to hide."
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.780]   So this is how we are to walk in the light.
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:33.260]   Then we have not only the contrast, not only this command to walk in the light, but we
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:39.860]   have a second command in verse 11: "Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness."
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.500]   We've seen the command to walk in the light.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.460]   We've seen the characteristics of walking in the light.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:53.600]   Now here's the command not to participate, and that's a form of the word kōnonēa, "have
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:45:00.000]   fellowship with the unfruitful deeds of darkness."
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.420]   We have nothing to do with them.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.140]   We don't participate with them.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.120]   We don't fellowship with them.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.200]   We don't associate with them.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:14.260]   We don't become linked with them, as 2 Corinthians 6 says.
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:20.600]   We don't get involved in some kind of supposed spiritual enterprise with the darkness.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:26.780]   We don't associate with people who profess Christ, 1 Corinthians 5, and are immoral.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:33.400]   We obviously reach the people in the world who are immoral, but we don't associate
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:41.380]   with those who profess salvation who are immoral.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.060]   So that simple command.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:48.160]   It's not hard to understand.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.680]   And why would you participate?
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.720]   Because the works are unfruitful.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:58.300]   On the other hand, the works in the light are the fruitful works of light.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:04.420]   Why do those things that produce nothing of value?
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.420]   So there's a contrast.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.440]   There are characteristics and then a command.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.660]   Then we have a commission, and I think this is so interesting, kind of getting toward
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.860]   the finish line.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.860]   There's a commission.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:15.860]   There's a commission.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:25.860]   If you're a child of light, instead of participating in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, instead
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.420]   expose them.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:33.620]   Expose them.
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:43.660]   If we listen to Paul in 2 Timothy 4:2, preach the word, "Reprove, rebuke."
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:53.360]   You don't ignore the deeds of darkness; you expose them.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.580]   That's your responsibility.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.160]   You expose them for what they are.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.980]   You expose them to the people who are the darkness.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.760]   You warn them.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:09.020]   You terrify them for the consequences of what they're doing.
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.460]   And in the church, you confront it.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.460]   Matthew 18, "Discipline."
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.260]   If anybody's in sin, you go to that person.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.380]   You take two or three witnesses.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.360]   You tell the church.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.420]   You expose sin.
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:30.820]   The church has to expose sin, not accommodate it, not make people engaged in the unfruitful
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:35.280]   deeds of darkness comfortable.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:40.260]   That's not what the Spirit of God did in Acts, chapter 5, when Ananias and Sapphira, who
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:43.260]   lied to the Holy Spirit, were executed in front of the entire church.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:50.700]   They were executed by God Himself, who slew them in the public service of the church so
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:57.760]   people would learn not to tolerate sin.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:04.660]   We have that responsibility to expose evil.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.660]   What does that mean?
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:11.760]   Well, there's a limit to that, and that's why the next verse has a caveat: "For it is
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.060]   disgraceful even to speak of the things of the world.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.100]   It is disgraceful to speak of the things which are done by them in secret."
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:21.500]   You expose them, but that doesn't mean you go into the lurid details.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:30.180]   There are just some things that aren't fit for even conversation, let alone behavior.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:36.000]   I don't know that there's anything in this culture that fits into verse 12 that is so
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.860]   disgraceful it should never be spoken about that people haven't already seen on their
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:43.860]   own.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:53.800]   It's disgraceful to speak of the things that deviated people do in secret.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.880]   It's disgraceful.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:05.360]   It's not anything you would even talk about.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:11.660]   It's so repulsive it shouldn't be mentioned, but when people are engaged in that without
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.660]   knowing the details.
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:16.400]   And when they're engaged in that, they're not going to be able to talk about the things
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.400]   they're doing.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.960]   It's just a mere point of the word, and it's not something that is in the Bible.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   It's just a mere point of the word, and it's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:28.080]   It's a mere point of the word, and it's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.080]   It's a mere point of the word, and it's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.080]   It's not something that's in the Bible.
