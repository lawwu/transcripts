[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with author and longtime pastor
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   John Piper.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.840]   Pastor John, here's a short question for you today.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.160]   Many of the best questions are brief, and it also comes to us anonymously, and many
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.800]   of the questions we get are unsigned.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.800]   Here it is.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.800]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.440]   Many sins harden our hearts.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.880]   We know this.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.600]   So what activities will unharden or soften our hearts?"
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.240]   What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.200]   That's a wonderful question to me, because I don't think I've ever asked it.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   I don't think I've ever put the question to myself that way.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   So it's really—
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.800]   I suppose that's the point of the podcast, right?
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.440]   It's really helpful to think about it.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:56.040]   And the first thing that happened as I began to think about it was that I realized there
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.920]   are two kinds of mistakes that I could make in trying to answer the question.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:14.160]   One would be to assume that hardness of heart implies I can do nothing because a hard, dead
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.860]   heart can't do anything of spiritual value.
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.560]   And the other mistake would be to assume that hardness of heart and the deadness that goes
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.720]   with it really haven't ruined me morally and that I can be the decisive cause of unhardening
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.120]   my heart.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.440]   I think both of those positions would be profound, unbiblical mistakes.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:53.520]   The biblical truth lies in the gospel paradox—we could call it the new covenant paradox—in
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:05.720]   which God causes the miracle of unhardening—God causes it—and I act the miracle of unhardening.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:16.560]   God is the decisive cause, but my acting is a real, essential part of the miracle taking
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   place.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.240]   So here's the promise God made for all of us who experience the power of the new covenant
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.240]   promise that was purchased by the blood of Jesus according to Luke 22.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.800]   Here's what he promises in Ezekiel 11.19.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.360]   I will give them one heart and a new spirit I will put within them.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:52.480]   I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh that
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:01.600]   they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them and be my people and I will
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.840]   be their God.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.320]   That's Ezekiel 11.19.20.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.520]   Here it is again in Ezekiel 36.26.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.880]   I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you and I will remove the
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.280]   heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.860]   within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to observe my rules.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:39.500]   So the point in those passages is that God must do the decisive miraculous heart transplant,
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.920]   heart replacement.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.140]   If we are going to escape the hardness and deadness of that heart, the old heart has
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:55.360]   to be taken out, a new heart has to be put in, and we can't do that surgery on ourselves.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   That's the point.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.740]   This is God's sovereign, gracious, saving work and the effect of it is new, tender,
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.100]   obedient love toward God.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.100]   And Deuteronomy puts it a little differently, chapter 30, verse 6, the Lord your God will
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:21.320]   circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring so that you will love the Lord your
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.640]   God with all your heart and soul and may live.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.420]   So if we're going to ever turn around, stop hating God, start loving God, he has to do
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.580]   that heart transplant and that heart circumcision.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:46.300]   But now having made that point, we have to also say that God commands us to do the very
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.260]   thing he promises to do in the new covenant.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:57.940]   For example, alongside the promise of Ezekiel 36, 26, "I will give you a new heart," there's
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:05.780]   Ezekiel 18, 31, "Make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit."
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.020]   And right alongside the promise, "The Lord will circumcise your heart," there's the command
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.860]   in Deuteronomy 10, 16, "Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no longer
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.860]   stubborn."
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.700]   There's the command in Jeremiah 4, 1 and 4, "O Israel, if you return to me, you should
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.700]   return.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.380]   Circumcise yourselves to the Lord.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.020]   Remove the foreskin of your heart."
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.380]   Same thing in the New Testament, there's the command of 1 Peter 3, 8, "All of you have
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.740]   a tender heart and a humble mind."
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.380]   Ephesians 4, 32, "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted."
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:52.940]   In other words, we're commanded to be tender, commanded not to be hard.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.980]   Tenderheartedness is the opposite of hardness of heart, and we're commanded to pursue it
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.300]   and to have it.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:09.580]   So the biblical picture is that God does the decisive work of heart transplant and heart
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:18.500]   circumcision and heart unhardening, and we are immediately participants in this miracle
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:28.040]   as conscious, intentional, willing actors, renouncing the old heart, cutting away.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.420]   With all of the opposition we can muster, cutting away the old life and embracing the
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:42.700]   new and welcoming and feeding the new tenderness of heart on God's Word, by God's Spirit.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:50.740]   So very specifically, in answer to the question that was asked, "What activities will unharden
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.220]   our heart?"
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:59.300]   I would say besides the divine activity, which is decisive and essential, there are at least
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:09.020]   three things we are called to do as we participate in acting this miracle that God is performing.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.780]   Beholding or seeing, hearing, and trusting—just a verse for each of those.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.620]   Second Corinthians 3, 18, "Beholding the glory of the Lord, we are being transformed
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.700]   into the image of God from one degree of glory to another."
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.820]   This comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.180]   So what do we do?
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.420]   We look to Jesus.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.060]   We look to Jesus.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.140]   And if you ask, "Where and how does that happen?"
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:42.700]   Paul says, "Secondly, faith comes by hearing, and hearing through the Word of Christ."
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:51.340]   So faith is the tender, dependent, opposite of rebellion and resistance and self-reliance,
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.700]   and faith comes by hearing.
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.500]   We are looking to Jesus with our ears.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.460]   We look with our ears.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:06.500]   The eyes of the heart look through the ears of the mind as the Word of God is read or
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:14.900]   preached or presented to us in some way, and we, thus being drawn by this sight to be conformed
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:20.980]   to Him, we trust Him, and that's the third verse, trust.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.740]   Galatians 2, 20, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:30.140]   It is no longer I who live, Christ who lives in me, and the life I now live, I live by
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.620]   faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:42.940]   So what comes alive when the old, hard heart is crucified and dead and taken out and circumcised
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:49.260]   away and cut off, what comes alive is the new, tender heart of faith.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.900]   I live by faith.
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:09:00.980]   So my final word, to paraphrase Paul, is work out your tenderness of heart.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:08.380]   Be about the miraculous unhardening of your heart, for God is the one who is at work in
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:15.020]   you to remove the hardness of heart and give you a tender heart of seeing and hearing and
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.060]   trusting.
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.900]   Profound biblical links here, Pastor John.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.900]   Thank you.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.380]   On Monday, we return, I'll ask Pastor John, "Does God love His enemies, or is that a command
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.380]   only for us?"
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.740]   It's an interesting little twist on Jesus' enemy love command.
