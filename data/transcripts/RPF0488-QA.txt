[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.800]   Today on Radical Personal Finance is a special live Q&A.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:35.120]   [Music]
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.480]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.880]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.680]   My name is Joshua and today we have a special live Q&A.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.440]   Usually we do these shows on Fridays and today it's Monday.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.200]   Let's see what happens.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.400]   I don't know if Friday questions are going to be more fun than Monday questions,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.400]   but whatever, I'll do my best.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.880]   [Music]
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.880]   So we come up on the 500th show of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.120]   I thought it'd be fun to do some more audience related things.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.960]   I want to share that with more of you and so I just had to open up a couple of days
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.960]   of Q&A calls for you, the listener, to be able to join in even if you are not a patron.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.480]   Usually these Friday Q&A shows are restricted to patrons of the show,
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.280]   but I thought it'd be fun to go and have an open mic.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.800]   So if you'd like to call into the show, just search, look in the description as you're
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.760]   listening to me right now.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.280]   Obviously this is being recorded live, but you're not hearing it live.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.280]   Look in the description on your phone and there'll be a link there in that description
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.360]   or on the computer to my Twitter page where I posted some info on when I'm doing these
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.640]   shows today, Monday, October 2, also Tuesday and Wednesday this week at 1 o'clock p.m.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.720]   Eastern Standard Time and the phone number and all the information that you need is listed
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.000]   right on that page.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.960]   So we're going to start with Joe in New Jersey.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.040]   Joe, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.920]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.880]   Great to be on the show.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.280]   So my question kind of revolves around my unique compensation package.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.200]   Warning, there's a lot of first world problems in my story, but nonetheless.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.000]   (Laughter.)
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.680]   And we are all very blessed to live, most of us, obviously.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.360]   I have listeners throughout the world, but those of us who live in the first world are
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.120]   very blessed and privileged to live here.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.680]   Absolutely.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.180]   Go ahead.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.360]   Very true.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.920]   Very true.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.960]   So I work for a major tech firm as a software engineer, and one unique part of our
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.280]   compensation packages is that it's very heavy on company stock.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.720]   So quarterly, after a single one-year cliff, we see a lot of this stock vest and come into
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.280]   my control.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.920]   I'm spleeted to have my first vesting, and quarterly thereafter, in February of 2018.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.440]   Given where the market is right now, I'm kind of hesitant to do anything outside of
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.680]   tax advantage accounts by throwing this into low-cost index funds.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.560]   My instinct tells me to pay off as much debt as I can and possibly even go into paying
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   down the principal on my mortgage, even though I do have a fairly advantageous rate.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:26.800]   I have a 7-1 ARM that should convert -- the 7 expires in 2023, I believe, and I'm currently
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.160]   sitting on a 287 rate.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.400]   So I'm kind of hesitant to put this into equities as I would, you know, following kind
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.600]   of the typical channels that I've read in the past.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.680]   But I'm wondering if there's something I might be missing, if there's other tax advantages
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.760]   I might be missing out on, if there's just a different way to think about this.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.040]   Because given the bull run we've been on, I have to imagine that there's a correction
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.640]   coming, and given how much I'm going to be -- how much money I'm going to be getting
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.440]   every single time, it seems kind of risky to throw everything in equities.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.080]   >>TED: Let's come back to the correction question in a moment.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.680]   I'll do one quick comment on that.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:17.680]   I have always loved the statement that economists -- I first heard Ziegler say it, so I want
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.880]   to give him credit -- that economists have successfully predicted all 17 of the last
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.760]   three recessions.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.320]   And I feel that way a little bit myself.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:34.560]   I expected -- my personal guess last year was that I thought that by the end of 2016
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.560]   or during 2017 -- those were the statements that I made to my wife -- I said, "I think
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   by the end of 2016 or during 2017, that we'll probably be back into a recession."
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.840]   It seems like we're long overdue, and I have mentally made my -- personally, that's what
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.640]   I thought would happen.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.440]   Now, all of the evidence that we have at present seems to indicate that I was wrong in that
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.320]   prediction.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.200]   I can't see that I was wrong in saying that somehow recessions are a thing of the past.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.360]   It's old and outdated and from the 18th century, so thus we're not going to have recessions
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.080]   again.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.920]   But I was certainly wrong on my timing.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.640]   So that is very thorny, of course, to predict that.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.600]   Let's come back to that in a minute.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.160]   Let's start with the most useful way to approach a question like this, which is your personal
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.040]   situation.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.400]   Run me through some numbers.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.920]   Ballpark, your household annual income is how much?
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.920]   Including salary, stock, like I spoke about, and cash bonus, it should end up somewhere
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.800]   around $350,000.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.200]   And how much is your house worth?
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.520]   Last appraisal put it somewhere at $490,000.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.920]   And how much is the mortgage balance presently?
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.760]   Somewhere in the realm of $345,000.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.920]   And other major assets, retirement accounts, about how much?
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.300]   Ballpark?
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.400]   Ballpark retirement accounts should be in the realm of $150,000.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.600]   OK.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.040]   And other investable assets or investment assets that aren't inside of a retirement
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.120]   account, specifically stocks, equities, things like that?
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.760]   Another $50,000 on top.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.360]   So $200,000 total, $150,000 retirement, $50,000 taxable.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.080]   OK.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.760]   Cash or cash equivalents, emergency funds, that type of thing, about how much?
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.640]   In the realm of $25,000.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.640]   And then any other major investment assets, real estate, business interests, et cetera?
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.520]   No, just personal vehicles, that sort of thing.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.240]   OK.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.960]   $345,000 on the mortgage.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.600]   Other debts?
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.540]   Yes.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.080]   Student loan debt, that should be paid off with that February vesting in the realm of $40,000.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.580]   OK.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.280]   And so any other debts other than that?
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.540]   No.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.280]   We've been fairly aggressive with the debt.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.720]   So that's the last of it.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.520]   That's great.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.600]   And so this particular vesting that you're looking at is about $40,000, right?
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.640]   No, that's just the amount we would pay off the student debt for.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.380]   How much?
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:24.240]   All in before Uncle Sam gets in there, assuming the stock price holds as it is today.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.880]   Should be in the realm of $100,000 in February.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.380]   OK.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.240]   You mentioned tech, and you mentioned that this is your first-- I think you said something like
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.800]   this is your first year-- you've reached this first year cliff vesting, and now you're getting
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.760]   your first quarterly.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.280]   How long have you been with this company?
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.920]   I started on January 9th of this year.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.680]   So this is fairly new in terms of your work there.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:56.240]   And that, I think, should be a major area of focus for you to pay attention to.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.520]   Because when you're new at a company, and if it's in tech, of course, there's a difference
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.640]   in how in your future that you've got to pay attention to.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.080]   It's less stable probably than some other things.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.840]   Before this particular company, do you have a good, strong history of employment, good
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.600]   strong history of finding opportunities, or is this kind of a breakout position for you?
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.680]   I would certainly call it a breakout position, but I definitely have a strong history in
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.400]   the industry.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.800]   The only difference between working at my current company is that I've just worked for
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.280]   much earlier stage companies in the past, just because it was sort of a lifestyle thing.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.280]   I was a little bit younger at the time.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.880]   I liked the startup vibe.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.640]   But I ended up joining the big company because I sort of hit the adult milestones.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.360]   Got married, bought a house, had a child, that sort of thing.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.440]   So comp was always an issue.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.880]   And stability, of course, too.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.720]   Even though this is a technology company, like you said, they're a little bit more volatile.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.320]   I actually have no problem saying what company it is, if you don't mind.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:56.880]   Sure, go ahead.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.960]   It's Facebook.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   So we do have a little bit of a decent track record, in air quotes.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.680]   Let me moderate my anti-Facebook rants then, out of respect for you.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.440]   Out of respect for your employment.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.920]   Actually, maybe this is my inside track here.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.840]   I can ask you all my Facebook questions.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.320]   Although I think that's better put in a private forum.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:20.820]   Full Q&A.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:29.040]   So I guess the best way to approach – the Facebook thing is relevant, because obviously
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.520]   that makes a big difference in terms of the stability of the company.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:39.120]   Just to say tech, I wasn't expecting such a large expression of a company.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.320]   As you said, Facebook.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.520]   So that is a relevant detail.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.020]   Thank you.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.600]   The options that you just sketched out.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.960]   Option number one is take the money, put it all into equities.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.240]   And option number two was take the money, pay off debts, and keep some cash left over.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.400]   Are those the two options that you're trying to decide between?
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.600]   Essentially, and I imagine there's probably some kind of middle ground in there as well.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.000]   And the only thing I would just reiterate is that after the February vesting, much less
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.400]   money in quantity, but quarterly vesting does take over and I should see windfalls every
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.600]   quarter of about – depending on stock fluctuation – 20 to 25,000.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.760]   So I guess the key thing I would identify with these two decisions is neither of them
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.960]   is particularly time-pressing and neither of them is probably going to be particularly
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.640]   impactful on your current lifestyle.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.440]   That's what makes it hard, because oftentimes when related to personal finance questions,
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.360]   there are things that are very timely or there are things that are related to – that are
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.480]   going to improve your lifestyle.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.000]   Let's say you don't – you didn't own a home and you're getting to the point where
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.480]   like we'd really like to own a home and this lifestyle choice of owning a home and
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.080]   this particular kind of home, this will make a big difference on our family life.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.000]   Well, in that situation, it's relatively easy because you look and say, "Is this
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.560]   the right home?
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.680]   Is this the right time?"
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.360]   And you prioritize those things that are going to make a big difference in your lifestyle.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.680]   But whether or not you face – you have student loans and whether or not you have an extra
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.160]   in your current situation, whether or not you have an extra 20 or $30,000 in the bank
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.360]   is – and/or whether or not you have your retirement accounts fully funded and you have
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:28.480]   a non-qualified stock account with $60,000, $70,000 of an index fund in it, neither of
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.680]   these is going to make a particularly big difference in your life.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.200]   So that's why this is a fairly unemotional – it's kind of an academic intellectual
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.080]   question of what's best to do but there's not a lot of emotion behind it.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:47.200]   Is there anything that – with regard to the money that does have more emotion?
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   Are there any long-held goals that you and your wife have had that – the things you'd
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.760]   wanted to pursue that would have more of an emotional weight to them?
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.840]   No.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.640]   Like you said, I think we're fairly rational when it comes to the decision around this
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.760]   money and all money, really.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.840]   I suppose the only thing you could really say as far as long-term goals would be just
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.200]   relatively debt-free college for our children.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.720]   We plan on having at least two, maxing out at three kids.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.840]   What else would be on the docket?
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.480]   Having an appropriately sized home for those children.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.600]   Other than that, we're fairly modest people.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:34.880]   I wouldn't say we're completely tuned out to the idea of financial independence much
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.000]   earlier than most Americans.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.480]   We'd certainly like to not necessarily have to work full-time in our, let's say, 50s and
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.360]   60s, but we're both lucky enough that we kind of do what we love.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.720]   I'm a software engineer, like I said.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.400]   I don't feel like I go to work every day.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.160]   My wife currently stays home but that might change.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.440]   We're both incredibly blessed but nothing too big as far as life goals.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.120]   >> And how old are you currently?
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.880]   >> I turned 32 this week and my wife is 31.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:15.280]   >> Well, in terms of how to approach it, I guess I would think carefully to see if there
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.080]   is any major life goal first.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.520]   It's okay if there's not, but if there is, you don't want to ignore it because oftentimes
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.640]   those things I think can be very, very important, very, very valuable.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.240]   Of course, you're just trying to be prudent and trying to make kind of good intellectual
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.640]   decisions.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.160]   So let's just tackle this intellectually.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:40.640]   With regard to timing the market, it does feel like markets are high and it does feel
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.320]   to me like we're due for a correction.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.840]   There are good arguments, technical arguments that could be made in that direction.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:59.360]   I lack confidence though making big decisions in that based upon that personally, especially
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.280]   big single decisions.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.160]   If you are investing kind of broadly in the mainstream approach toward investments using
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:15.520]   equities, using low-cost investment funds, and your basic theory is that in general,
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.880]   these companies are going to do well.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.360]   They're going to grow due to management decisions, taking advantage of new markets,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:23.920]   et cetera.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.480]   And the basic theory that underlies this is what's called the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.800]   Basic idea, depending on which version of the efficient market hypothesis we accept,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:41.680]   is generally the prices of companies are going to be pretty well priced.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.880]   You're going to pay about what a company is worth when you go and buy the stock.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:53.440]   From this theory and from this philosophy, it comes out the natural movement to say that
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:00.000]   you can probably buy into the market at just about any time because you don't have any
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.200]   special inside information that the market is high.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.000]   You don't have any special information that every other of the thousands of analysts that
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.400]   are judging the market that they don't have.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.720]   It's a very competitive environment.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.480]   And so most likely, the market price today reflects all of the currently known information.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.840]   Now, it's easy to think that we have some kind of contrarian insight.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.600]   For example, it's easy for me to look at the market and say, "Man, it just seems – everything
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.400]   seems so high.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.320]   It seems like we're due for a correction."
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.960]   But the market is made up of millions and millions of people who are all buying and
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.640]   selling, trading these assets that they have, and each of them thinks that they're making
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.360]   a good move.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.600]   And so on the aggregate, I think a good dose of humility is in store when it comes to making
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.960]   specific investment decisions.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.800]   You kind of have to look at it and say, "You know what?
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.080]   Really?
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.600]   I can't know – I don't know any more than all of these other traders do."
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.560]   You might know more about how to write good software and how to get your code to be very
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.960]   elegant and very efficient.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.720]   But at the end of the day, you don't know more about the market than I do or than anybody
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.680]   else does.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.600]   And so the way that you handle this while being confident to make a decision is you
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.960]   look at it and you say, "I'm looking forward over the course of decades."
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.400]   And if you're 32 and you're saying, "I might like to be financially independent
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.840]   in my 50s or 60s.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.760]   It's not very important to me that I'm financially independent in five years."
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.880]   Over the course of a few decades, chances are things are probably going to work out
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.840]   pretty well.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:42.080]   And so if you did invest your surplus into the market and you did it all at one time,
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.720]   I think that would be a very reasonable thing to do because you could look forward and say,
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.040]   "This fits my overall investment strategy.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.240]   I've got a couple of decades for prices to continue to – they'll go up and they'll
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:52.560]   go down.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.600]   They'll go up and they'll go down.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.800]   But on the whole, I'm betting that things will go up."
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:03.520]   So that's not – so I think that you're invested in this mentally in terms of this
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:09.840]   overall philosophy and given these philosophical constraints of mainstream investing, of the
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:16.000]   efficient market hypothesis, it makes sense not to worry about any particular unique fluctuation
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.040]   in the market.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.640]   It makes sense just to go ahead and say, "I'm going to go ahead and put some money
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.040]   in.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.800]   There's almost never a bad time to buy."
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.040]   The theory is this.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.480]   Current market prices reflect all currently known information.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.640]   So it's possible that next week some new information will come out.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.040]   Or some circumstances will change that will affect market prices.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.200]   But at the moment, market prices are fair.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.360]   They reflect all currently known information.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.280]   I don't think that's going to make a big difference to your lifestyle.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.440]   But it will help you to start moving towards more accumulation.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.520]   I think that you've got a lot of room to use this new job.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.160]   I think you've got a lot of room to start piling up many more substantial assets.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.840]   Sounds like you've done a great job of, "Hey, we've got a house that's appropriate
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.600]   for us," given your current income of $350,000 a year.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.840]   A house valued at $490,000 is a perfectly reasonable decision.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.760]   You're a little light in terms of where you could be if this income continues in the coming
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.000]   years.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.080]   You're a little light in terms of investment assets.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.600]   So I'd love to see you move in that direction.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.040]   But I think that's just a reflection of the fact that this is a new job, a big step
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.280]   up, a breakthrough career opportunity for you.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.880]   And that will happen in the next couple of years.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.760]   Emotionally, I think there's a good case to make for paying off the student loans.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:44.400]   I think that would put you in a situation where you have no debt other than the mortgage,
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.480]   and that's a secured asset, which is probably well-financed.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.600]   And you can clear yourself of that if you ever move from the house.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.640]   I think if I woke up in your shoes just emotionally, I would pay off the student loans myself
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.840]   because I don't like having that debt, especially debt that is unsecured debt for which I'm
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:08.160]   personally liable and the fact that I can't – I don't get any protection from those.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.160]   But that's kind of an emotional decision, not so much a clear logical decision.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.880]   And how I'd balance in terms of the proper thing to do is, of course, well, how much
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.160]   – what's the interest rate?
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.200]   Calculate all that.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.320]   If I woke up in your shoes, I'd pay off the student loans, especially with $100,000
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:22.960]   windfall.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.200]   I'd pay off the $40,000 of student loans.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.920]   Then the flip side is if I were you, I'd pile up more of an emergency fund.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.880]   Rather than pursuing equities right away, I personally would want to build a stronger
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.440]   emergency fund than just $25,000.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.040]   Do you have any idea of how much your monthly expenses are right now?
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.760]   Michael Munger Yeah.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.080]   Generally, I target around a budget of $6,500.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.920]   So if you extrapolate that out to somewhere between an intelligent emergency fund of four
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.480]   to six months.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.360]   We're right on the cost, right on the cost.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.480]   Trevor Burrus: Good.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:58.720]   Okay.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.000]   So $6,500 is good.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.280]   The issue is – well, the $6,500 – my calculator stopped working.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.240]   I try not to do live math, but I guess it is.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:20.480]   With $6,500, a six-month emergency fund is going to – $6,500 a month.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.600]   A six-month emergency fund is $39,000.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.120]   For you as a single income earner with your wife not presently bringing an income into
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.760]   the household, I think a six months would be a target.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.840]   So $40,000 emergency fund would be good.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:41.120]   I personally – I think there's a lot of power in a little bit more.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.360]   So I guess depending on how you wind up with taxes, if I woke up in your shoes, I'd probably
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.040]   take some of the windfall, set aside some of it, and try to come up with some kind of
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.760]   fun, memorable way to spend the money.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.320]   I'd knock out the student loans and I'd probably put 25 grand in my emergency fund,
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.480]   and I'd do that with this particular $100,000 windfall.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.240]   Bring me up to a $50,000 emergency fund, make me debt-free except for the house, and then
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.520]   I'd schedule something fun for the family, a special way to celebrate our success with
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   this earning ability.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:18.320]   Then I'd probably develop a formula or a theory to follow with those quarterly disbursements
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:18.880]   going forward.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.080]   I guess that's how I'd handle it.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.960]   Questions, comments, Joe?
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.240]   Joe Fornear No, this was pretty much confirmation of
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.920]   the thoughts I had before I called.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.240]   But hearing it from somebody whose opinions that I've kind of taken to heart in the past,
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.840]   gives me a lot more confidence to pull the trigger on exactly what you've outlined.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.800]   Marc Thiessen Good.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.440]   Well, congratulations on having an awesome breakout in your career.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:52.320]   I think that's really tremendous and it shows even just the power of a career and a career
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.040]   growth.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.720]   So I congratulate you on achieving such an incredible career.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.680]   I'm sure you've worked very, very hard to develop the skills in order to build that.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.120]   Just remember, you're going to start to be targeted with all kinds of opportunities.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.600]   Just because you're earning new money, don't lose any – or big money, which from what
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.840]   you described, you're earning big money for the first time.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.440]   Don't lose confidence in your willingness to think things through carefully and use
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.960]   common sense in all of your decisions.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.760]   But it sounds like you've got that wrapped up and hopefully, I'll continue to serve you
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.360]   in coming years.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.600]   Hannah, North Carolina, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.480]   How can I serve you today?
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.320]   Hannah Neumann Hi, thanks.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.000]   Excuse me.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.440]   Sorry, that was really gross sounding.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.800]   Marc Thiessen All good.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.960]   Hannah Neumann Yeah.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.240]   So thanks for taking my call.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:49.280]   I'm calling, seeking your advice on how to proceed in a relationship with somebody that
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.000]   I'm mentoring.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.120]   So she's a young woman.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:51.920]   She's 15.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.720]   She's living in poverty currently.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.360]   Her mom is a single mom.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:04.960]   And she saved up several – almost $1,000 over the summer.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.400]   And then her mom lost her job.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.720]   There was a series of unfortunate events.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.200]   And so she gave all her money to her mom.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.560]   She didn't ask me my advice on it then.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:25.520]   But I do feel I have a space to speak to both mom and daughter.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:31.680]   And I was wondering, is that a good thing for a 15-year-old to be doing?
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:37.920]   Should I be pointing her towards, "Hey, there's a lot of upcoming expenses in your
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.420]   future.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:44.960]   How would you proceed in this situation given the tiny amount of information I've just
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.460]   given you?
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.640]   I can give you more."
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.680]   Marc Thiessen Yeah, that is a really interesting question
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.480]   because it brings in so many other – so many things.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.320]   So a couple of questions.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:02.800]   With regard to the mother and the mother's actions and behavior, do you see that the
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.000]   mother – is the mother a responsible mother?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Is she – well, sorry.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.240]   Is the mother abusive towards her daughter?
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.840]   Kate Sills No.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.480]   Marc Thiessen And by all accounts, obviously, they're
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.280]   living in poverty.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.360]   And that's not necessarily – that doesn't indicate necessarily yes or no.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.600]   But from other accounts, does the mother seem to be responsible in her life and in
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.320]   her lifestyle?
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:30.080]   Kate Sills She is a great mom.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:41.680]   She has never successfully held a job for very long, largely because some of her own
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.240]   actions.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:57.680]   So probably I sort of think of her as a good woman but not particularly – she doesn't
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.680]   take all the right steps to escape poverty, so to speak.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.160]   Marc Thiessen And so these types of job actions, are we
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.160]   talking – is the mother, to the best of your knowledge, is she addicted to drugs or
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.200]   to alcohol?
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:09.840]   Or are these more –
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.320]   Kate Sills No, no, no.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:10.960]   Marc Thiessen OK, good.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.460]   All right.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.600]   Man, it's tough.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.560]   Just this weekend, I was having a conversation with some family members.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.840]   We were at a family birthday party.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:26.560]   And we were talking about some of the – just the different situations of people that are
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:35.360]   close to us and some of the different relationships that have developed for us, each of us with
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.560]   different people.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.760]   But just some really, really struggling people that we are – we're in their lives, they're
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.240]   in our lives.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.200]   We're trying to help them.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:54.000]   And I often struggle to know how to help people at the most basic level of success.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.840]   I think of – I asked Dan Sullivan a question one time.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.960]   Dan Sullivan is a well-known executive coach.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.800]   He has a program called Strategic Coach.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.400]   And it's exclusively open to people who are earning $100,000 or more.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.320]   That's his minimum entry requirement for anybody to even apply to be part of the coaching
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.720]   program is you have to be a six-figure income earner.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.920]   And I asked Dan Sullivan one time, I said, "You've done all this incredible coaching
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.600]   work," and he's widely renowned in the coaching world as being really good at helping
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.360]   people to go from $100,000 a year to a million and beyond.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.480]   I said, "You've done all this work in the coaching world to help people go from $100,000
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.280]   and up."
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.960]   And I said, "What about helping people go from zero to 100?
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.760]   How do you do that?
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.680]   What thoughts and ideas and suggestions do you have to help people go from zero to 100?"
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.160]   And Dan said, "I don't know.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.560]   I don't know how to help people get that."
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.080]   He says, "It's not my thing."
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.240]   And I often personally feel that way when it comes to personal finance, that so many
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:03.360]   people face challenges with regard to what I'm imagining based upon what you're describing,
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.440]   personal problems.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.200]   They have prickly personalities.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:15.760]   They struggle to do the basic skills of success, show up on time, work hard, just very basic
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.720]   things that aren't necessarily as obviously identifiable as a moral failing like being
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.400]   an alcoholic, but they're not as diagnosable.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.200]   If somebody is an alcoholic, you can say, "Well, here, you have a problem.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.520]   Let's work on a solution and a treatment plan, and let's work on an accountability
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.040]   plan, and let's fix this."
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.920]   But if somebody just has a prickly personality or somebody who doesn't do a very good job
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.240]   at thinking ahead, it's a lot harder to know how to help them.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:49.360]   And so I often struggle with scenarios like you're describing with a mother in this
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.680]   circumstance because you kind of see the things that need to be done, but you don't know
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.040]   how to help them learn.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.360]   And I do not have good answers for the mother.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.400]   But maybe we could talk it through with the daughter, which is obviously the question
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.120]   that you're asking.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   I have some thoughts, but before I do, I just want to hear, because you're the one
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.160]   who knows the situation.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.720]   What do you think?
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.600]   Do you think that the daughter did the right thing, is doing the right thing here?
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:22.480]   I think the daughter did the right thing the first time around.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.000]   I really would like for her…
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:36.560]   So she aspires to go to college, and I would like for her to have several thousand dollars
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.880]   in the bank before she goes to college.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:45.680]   She would be in a situation where she could probably get scholarships and very minimal
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:52.160]   debt, and the Pell Grant and things like that would be able to get her through college.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.000]   But I worry that she wouldn't…
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.040]   One thing goes wrong at home, mom asks her to come back.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:06.720]   I'm worried that she's kind of setting herself up for a codependent relationship rather than
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:13.040]   when I left home, my parents didn't need my help.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:25.040]   I was able to set up sort of an independent life from my parents relatively quickly, whereas
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.960]   I feel like if she…
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:37.040]   Even if her mom stops asking her for money come college time, I worry that she would
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:43.440]   just be so close to the edge and so used to that really, really tight relationship with
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:51.840]   her family that she wouldn't actually be able to make it through college if she doesn't
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.760]   have some financial buffer before heading off.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   Does that make sense?
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.880]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:05.440]   So kind of the counseling questions, there's almost the counseling questions of the relationship
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.360]   and then there's the financial question of how to help someone get a few thousand dollars
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.400]   as a buffer and establish their own independent life.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.800]   Here's how I think through the issues and I want to be very humble in my thoughts.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.680]   I think in a situation like this, the most important thing is to actually be close to
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:27.360]   the situation as you are and to try to see what's actually going on because I don't
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.440]   think the external description is always going to be the appropriate…
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:38.000]   You got to be close enough to actually know what's actually going on in this circumstance.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.560]   So I think that first and foremost, parents have a responsibility towards their children.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:49.200]   Ideally, the appropriate model for parents is that parents should be in the situation
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:56.880]   where they're able to support their children and provide for their children and it's
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.080]   ideal if they can do that without necessarily the work of the children.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.960]   That's really an ideal model.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.520]   There's a biblical proverb that I have often thought was inspirational that it says, "A
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.160]   righteous man leaves an inheritance to his children's children," and the implication
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.840]   is that there is work that's being done that's not only sufficient to support me
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.080]   but also my children and my children's children.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.960]   I've always found that to be very inspirational.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:30.320]   The challenge is I think there's also a responsibility from children to their parents
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:36.800]   and I admire when a child takes that responsibility on seriously.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.000]   Now as an adult, it's usually a little bit easier because the adult can – an adult
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.480]   child is an independent person.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:51.360]   And so for me as an adult, I have a responsibility to help and support my parents and I can do
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.560]   that as an autonomous adult who's able to earn money, have my own household, etc.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.480]   So there's more of an equal footing with my parents in the sense that we're adults.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.200]   But as children, I think that there is still some of that responsibility, that there is
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.880]   a sense of family responsibility and there are many families throughout the world who
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.560]   if it weren't for the contributions financially to the family of the children, the family
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.520]   would starve.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:21.600]   And so I admire the ethos of a child supporting her mother, especially a single mother, a
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.200]   single mother living in poverty.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.320]   I admire that and I think that's a rightful instinct.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.760]   But of course we want to protect the child, the more vulnerable one, and we want to make
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.880]   sure that she's not being taken advantage of and that's why we look for those questions
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.520]   about the mother.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.000]   Is this being used because this is actually an important need in the family?
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.800]   We're going to go hungry.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.240]   We're going to go without housing.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:49.600]   Or is the daughter being abused and her earnings are being abused to allow the mother to make
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   frivolous purchases, things like that?
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.920]   And I don't know how to judge that from an external perspective.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:01.120]   But I do think that I admire the ethos and I think it's important and valuable for
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.280]   that daughter to work and support the family.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.560]   I don't think that there's some kind of arbitrary line that somehow before 18 children
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.840]   should just play, play, play, and then after 18 then it doesn't matter what mom or dad
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.340]   do.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:21.520]   Children – there's a long line of history and even today of young children, 9 years
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:26.560]   old, 10 years old, 12, 13, 14, 15 years old, working and supporting their families.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.400]   And I think that's – we should honor that.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.280]   So I mean I guess those are the dimensions that I look at.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:41.840]   I do think that it would be valuable to teach the child and help to teach the daughter some
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.600]   of the things to be careful of in terms of the codependent relationship.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.280]   And here would be my idea in terms of how the daughter could help the mother.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.800]   Depending on what the money was spent on, one way that I think the daughter could help
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:58.400]   the mother would be to use some of her earnings to take more responsibility for herself.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.000]   So maybe if she had $1,000 saved as an example, maybe she can make a small gift to the mother.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.280]   But perhaps if the mother needs the money for something, perhaps she could say, "Mom,
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.000]   I want to help.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.640]   Tell you what.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:16.480]   Why don't – instead of you giving me money for my lunch or instead of you trying to help
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.400]   me clothe myself, I'm going to use some – I'll take these responsibilities over
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.320]   for myself and I'll start buying my clothes.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.400]   I'll start paying for my lunch.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.840]   I'll start doing some of these things."
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.840]   And that way, the daughter is taking some of the burden from the mother financially
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.760]   but we don't run into the kind of the dangers of the money back and forth.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:44.880]   That's one idea that I have supporting the family also in terms of if you see the mother
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.440]   making bad decisions, maybe there's a way where – hopefully you have access to be
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.400]   able to work with the mother.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:55.200]   But maybe there's a way where you can encourage the daughter in some basic ways that she can
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:55.840]   improve things.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.520]   For example, maybe the mother is overspending in an area that's causing real problems.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.040]   I think of a family that I knew growing up.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.400]   It was actually close friends.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.160]   And this particular mother was a single mother.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.680]   She had been abandoned by her husband and had three beautiful girls and she worked night
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.160]   and day to provide for her girls.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:26.000]   But one of the things that happened is because she was so overworked to provide for her
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.080]   daughters, that leads to a lot of times inefficiency where she's too tired to cook from scratch.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.760]   She's too tired to do some of those frugal things that can help but there's just no
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.280]   way that she could do those.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.360]   And so in that context, I've thought of that situation and I thought, "Well, maybe
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.320]   there'd be a way that the daughters could contribute meaningfully to the family finances
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.480]   by helping with some of those things that are time-intensive but make a real difference
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.240]   to the savings of the family."
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.200]   They're just things that the mother just has no time to be able to do.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.160]   She can't do them because she's got to work and she's got to earn the income.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:09.760]   And then maybe that establishes a good basis for that relationship to be healthy and then
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:15.040]   to work together but the daughter to increasingly grow in her earning ability, increasingly
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.400]   grow in her ability to support.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.400]   Is that helpful at all?
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.520]   Is that kind of the direction that your question is going, Hannah?
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.400]   Hannah Zinkham: Yeah, those are some helpful ideas.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.920]   I know we've definitely discussed you need to be buying your own clothes now that you're
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.480]   earning money and things like that.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.080]   So she has taken on some of those.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:39.560]   These were the specific money was for a car repair and they had gotten behind on utilities.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:45.280]   So that's when she gave her mom all the money all at once.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:52.160]   But I do think there are some good principles there and I don't know.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.920]   Ted Kelly: Yeah, car repair and utilities, I mean how do you fault that?
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.120]   Those are real needs.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.520]   Those are real, real needs.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.800]   If a single mom doesn't have a car and she's already got a checkered earnings history and
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.360]   she doesn't have the ability to get to work, that's a huge need.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.960]   That's a real, real need.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.440]   And then utilities, that's a real need as well.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:18.920]   And so I don't know of a single easy answer in a circumstance like that.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:25.760]   I do think that as she's fortunate that you're there, my thought would just be in terms of
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.540]   her going to college, yes, her to have some savings will make a big difference.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:36.120]   But I think that over time, she'll be able to get the scale up enough where she could
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:41.040]   – where we're not just dealing with $1,000 and then she's back to school full time.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:46.600]   But when she can start to get into a few thousand dollars, then that'll provide for her.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.760]   I have no magic question.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.080]   But it's certainly a challenging situation.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.680]   I'm glad you're there, frankly.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:57.120]   I mean that's the only solution that I know of is to have somebody who's thoughtful,
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.180]   who's not emotionally invested, who's in the situation, who can work with the mother
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:05.240]   and the daughter and provide useful counseling and provide the help when they need it.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.600]   Hannah S.: Well, hopefully I can be useful.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   We'll see.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:15.680]   Paul Battelle: Well, you're there for a reason and I love to hear that.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:21.920]   We often I think go too quickly to kind of big solutions when in reality somebody needs
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.920]   a friend to come by and help.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   Any other questions or comments before I go on, Hannah?
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.560]   Hannah S.: No, thank you.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:32.280]   Paul Battelle: Oops, I thought I had one more call and that one just dropped off.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.600]   I guess that's it for Callers for Today show.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.240]   So let me just close with this encouragement to you.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.760]   I love hearing circumstances like Hannah just described because Hannah's there.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.480]   Let me just encourage you.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:49.620]   Get involved in any opportunity that you have to help somebody.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:54.280]   When you find out of a person in need, get involved and help.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.560]   Look especially to single parents.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:05.560]   Single moms and dads face a Herculean task to establish their families and to build.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:11.800]   Just a few weeks ago, my wife was just flat on her back, sick for a few days and I was
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:18.360]   refreshed in how hard it is to get anything accomplished on my list, all my things I want
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:24.020]   to do without her to help me with our children.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:30.560]   If she were not here, it would be tough, tough, tough.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:36.360]   Three small children do not a great productive day make when productivity is measured by
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.120]   things checked off a to-do list.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.500]   So get involved and there are a lot of things that you can do that are very, very simple
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.080]   that are very, very helpful.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:50.760]   If you know of a single mom who's in need, go by and help her with some home projects.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:56.440]   Maybe you can help her fix the roof, help her paint the house, help with the landscaping.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:01.460]   There are all kinds of things that we can do that don't necessarily involve transferences
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.360]   of money, although money is important.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:09.160]   Oftentimes money comes with certain challenges, especially if you see somebody who is challenged
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.080]   in their management of money, which can be for many reasons.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.840]   Sometimes you don't want to give direct money, but money is really useful.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.840]   Buy groceries, do anything you can to help out because people who are in these situations
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.040]   face really, really challenging circumstances.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:28.640]   It's only in the context of community, of friends and friends, neighbors and neighbors,
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.720]   church members to church members that they can really oftentimes have the things that
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.720]   they need.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.720]   So use Hannah's example, get involved, mentor the children, and get involved, get close
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.400]   to the situation so that you can give good, helpful, useful help.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.400]   That's it for today's show.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.800]   If you'd like to join for tomorrow's show, details in the description.
