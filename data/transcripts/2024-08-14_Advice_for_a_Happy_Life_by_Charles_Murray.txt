[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.280]   Advice for a Happy Life by Charles Murray
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.040]   The transition from college to adult life is treacherous,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.280]   and this is nowhere more visible than among new college graduates in their first real jobs.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.240]   A few years ago, I took it upon myself to start writing tips for the young staff where I work
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.640]   about how to avoid doing things that would make their supervisors write them off.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.680]   It began as a lark as I wrote tips with titles such as "Excise the word 'like' from your spoken
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.760]   English." But eventually, I found myself getting into the deeper waters of how to go about living
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.960]   a good life. At that point, I had to deal with a reality. When it comes to a life filled with
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.520]   deep and lasting satisfactions, most of the cliches are true. How could I make them sound
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.600]   fresh to a new generation? Here's how I tried. 1. Consider Marrying Young
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.560]   The age of marriage for college graduates has been increasing for decades,
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.960]   and this cultural shift has been a good thing. Many 22-year-olds are saved from bad marriages
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.560]   because they go into relationships at that age assuming that marriage is still out of the
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.200]   question. But should you assume that marriage is still out of the question when you're 25? 27?
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.400]   I'm not suggesting that you decide ahead of time that you will get married in your 20s.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.040]   You've got to wait until the right person comes along. I'm just pointing out that you shouldn't
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.360]   exclude the possibility. If you wait until your 30s, your marriage is likely to be a merger.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.440]   If you get married in your 20s, it is likely to be a startup.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.680]   Merger marriages are what you tend to see on the weddings pages of the Sunday New York Times.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.520]   Highly educated couples in their 30s, both people well on their way to success.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.800]   Lots of things can be said in favor of merger marriages. The bride and groom may be more mature,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.280]   less likely to outgrow each other, or to feel impelled 10 years into the marriage
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.280]   to make up for their lost youth. But let me put in a word for startup marriages,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.280]   in which the success of the partners isn't yet assured. The groom with his new architecture
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.480]   degree is still designing stairwells, and the bride is starting her third year of medical school.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.520]   Their income doesn't leave them impoverished, but they have to watch every penny.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.080]   What are the advantages of a startup marriage? For one thing, you will both have memories of
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.520]   your life together when it was all still up in the air. You'll have fun remembering the years
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.880]   when you went from being scared newcomers to the point at which you realized you were going to make
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.480]   it. Even more important, you and your spouse will have made your way together. Whatever happens,
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.200]   you will have shared the experience, and each of you will know that you wouldn't have become
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.400]   the person you are without the other. Many merger marriages are happy, but a certain kind of
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.800]   symbiosis, where two people become more than the sum of the individuals, is perhaps more common
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:48.240]   in startups. Two, learn how to recognize your soulmate. Ready for some cliches about marriage?
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.720]   Here they come, because they're true. Marry someone with similar tastes and preferences.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.640]   Which tastes and preferences? The ones that will affect life almost every day. It is okay if you
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.360]   like the ballet and your spouse doesn't. Reasonable people can accommodate each other on such
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.920]   differences. But if you dislike each other's friends, or don't get each other's senses of humor,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.960]   or especially if you have different ethical impulses, break it off and find someone else.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.720]   Personal habits that you find objectionable are probably deal breakers. Jacques Barzun
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.280]   identified the top three as punctuality, orderliness, and thriftiness. It doesn't
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.080]   make any difference which point of the spectrum you're on, he observed. Some couples are very
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.360]   happy living always in debt, always being late, and finding leftover pizza under a sofa cushion.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.920]   You just have to be at the same point on the spectrum. Intractable differences will become,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.080]   over time, a fingernail dragged across the blackboard of a marriage.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.720]   What you see is what you're going to get. If something about your prospective spouse bothers
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.280]   you, but you think you can change your beloved after you're married, you're wrong. Be prepared
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.920]   to live with whatever bothers you, or forget it. Your spouse will undoubtedly change during a long
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:24.880]   marriage, but not in ways you can predict or control. It is absolutely crucial that you really,
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.200]   really like your spouse. You hear it all the time from people who are in great marriages,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:39.360]   "I'm married to my best friend." They are being literal. A good working definition of "soulmate"
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.920]   is "your closest friend to whom you are also sexually attracted." Here are two things to worry
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.120]   about as you look for that person. Do you sometimes pick at each other's sore spots?
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.480]   You like the same things, have fun together, the sex is great, but one of you is controlling or
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.800]   nags the other, or won't let a difference of opinion go or knowingly says things that will
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:10.160]   hurt you? Break it off. Another cause for worry is the grand passion. You know a relationship is a
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.040]   grand passion if you find yourself behaving like an adolescent long after adolescence has passed.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:23.520]   You are obsessed and more than a little crazy. Not to worry. Everyone should experience at least
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:32.160]   one grand passion. Just don't act on it while the storm is raging. A good marriage is the best thing
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:40.400]   that can ever happen to you. Above all else, realize that this clichÃ© is true. The downside
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.080]   risks of marrying, and they are real, are nothing compared with what you will gain from a good one.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:56.000]   3. Eventually stop fretting about fame and fortune. One of my assumptions about you
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.440]   is that you are ambitious, meaning that you hope to become famous, rich, or both,
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.800]   and intend to devote intense energy over the next few decades to pursuing those dreams.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:17.040]   That is as it should be. I look with suspicion on any talented 20-something who doesn't feel that
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:25.280]   way. I wish you luck. But suppose you arrive at age 40 and you enjoy your work, have found your
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   soulmate, are raising a couple of terrific kids, and recognize that you will probably never become
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.440]   either rich or famous. At that point, it is important to supplement your youthful ambition
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.080]   with mature understanding. Years ago, I was watching a television profile of David Geffen,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.000]   the billionaire music and film producer. At some point, he said, "Show me someone who
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.600]   thinks that money buys happiness, and I'll show you someone who has never had a lot of money."
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:04.800]   The remark was accompanied by an ineffably sad smile on Mr. Geffen's face, which said that
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:11.680]   he had been there, done that, and knew what he was talking about. The whole vignette struck me
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:19.520]   in a way that "money can't buy happiness" never had, and my visceral reaction was reinforced by
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.920]   one especially memorable shot during the profile, taken down the length of Mr. Geffen's private jet
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:34.400]   along the rows of empty leather seats and sofas, to where he sat all alone in the rear.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:41.360]   The problem that you face in your 20s and 30s is that you are gnawed by anxiety that you won't be
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:48.560]   a big success. It is an inevitable side effect of ambition. My little story about David Geffen
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:56.080]   won't help. Now, pull it out again in 20 years. Fame and wealth do accomplish something.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.480]   They cure ambition anxiety. But that's all. It isn't much.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:10.720]   4. Take religion seriously. Don't bother to read this one if you're already satisfyingly
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.320]   engaged with a religious tradition. Now that we're alone, here's where a lot of you stand
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.920]   when it comes to religion. It isn't for you. You don't mind if other people are devout,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.000]   but you don't get it. Smart people don't believe that stuff anymore.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.320]   I can be sure that is what many of you think because your generation of high-IQ,
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   college-educated young people, like mine 50 years ago, has been as thoroughly socialized
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.000]   to be secular as your counterparts in preceding generations were socialized to be devout.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.640]   Some of you grew up with parents who weren't religious and you've never given religion a
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.600]   thought. Others of you followed the religion of your parents as children but left religion behind
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.240]   as you were socialized by college. By socialized, I don't mean that you studied theology under
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.760]   professors who persuaded you that Thomas Aquinas was wrong. You didn't study theology at all.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.800]   None of the professors you admired were religious. When the topic of religion came up,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.400]   they treated it dismissively or as a subject of humor. You went along with the zeitgeist.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:23.280]   I am describing my own religious life from the time I went to Harvard until my late 40s. At that
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.000]   point, my wife, prompted by the birth of our first child, had found a religious tradition in which
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.520]   she was comfortable, Quakerism, and had been attending Quaker meetings for several years.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:41.680]   I began keeping her company and started reading on religion. I still describe myself as an agnostic,
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:50.400]   but my unbelief is getting shaky. Taking religion seriously means work. If you're waiting for a
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.040]   road to Damascus experience, you're kidding yourself. Getting inside the wisdom of the
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.320]   great religions doesn't happen by sitting on beaches, watching sunsets, and waiting for
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.040]   enlightenment. It can easily require as much intellectual effort as a law degree.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:12.800]   Even dabbling at the edges has demonstrated to me the depths of Judaism, Buddhism, and Daoism.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.120]   I assumed that I would find similar depths in Islam and Hinduism as well.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.680]   I certainly have developed a far greater appreciation for Christianity,
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.800]   the tradition with which I am most familiar. The Sunday school stories I learned as a child
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.400]   bear no resemblance to Christianity taken seriously. You've got to grapple with the
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:39.840]   real thing. Start by jarring yourself out of unreflective atheism or agnosticism.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.400]   A good way to do that is to read about contemporary cosmology.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:52.160]   The universe isn't only stranger than we knew. It is stranger and vastly more unlikely than we
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.280]   could have imagined, and we aren't even close to discovering its last mysteries.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:04.480]   That reading won't lead you to religion, but it may stop you from being unreflective.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.600]   Find ways to put yourself around people who are profoundly religious.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:16.240]   You will encounter individuals whose intelligence, judgment, and critical faculties
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:22.720]   are as impressive as those of your smartest atheist friends, and who also possess a
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.560]   disquieting confidence in an underlying reality behind the many religious dogmas.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:37.120]   They have learned to reconcile faith and reason, yes, but beyond that, they persuasively convey
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.880]   ways of knowing that transcend intellectual understanding. They exhibit in their own
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:49.200]   personae a kind of wisdom that goes beyond just having intelligence and good judgment.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.960]   Start reading religious literature. You don't have to go back to Aquinas,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.240]   though that wouldn't be a bad idea. The past hundred years have produced excellent and
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.560]   accessible work, much of it written by people who came to adulthood as uninvolved in religion as you
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:15.440]   are. Watch Groundhog Day repeatedly. The movie Groundhog Day was made more than two decades ago,
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:21.520]   but it is still smart and funny. It is also a brilliant moral fable that deals with the most
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.760]   fundamental issues of virtue and happiness, done with such subtlety that you really need to watch
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:34.960]   it several times. An egocentric TV weatherman, played by Bill Murray, is sent to Punxsutawney,
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:42.560]   Pennsylvania to cover Groundhog Day. He hates the assignment, disdains the town and its people,
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:50.320]   and can't wait to get back to Pittsburgh. But a snowstorm strikes, he's stuck in Punxsutawney,
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:57.760]   and when he wakes up the next morning, it is Groundhog Day again. And again. And again.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:05.520]   And again. The director and co-writer, Harold Ramis, whose death last month was mourned by
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:12.560]   his many fans, estimated that the movie has to represent at least 30 or 40 years worth of days.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.560]   We see only a few dozen of them, ending when Bill Murray's character has discovered the secrets of
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:26.320]   human happiness. Without the slightest bit of preaching, the movie shows the bumpy, unplanned
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:33.680]   evolution of his protagonist from a jerk to a fully realized human being. A person who has
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:41.040]   learned to experience deep, lasting, and justified satisfaction with life, even though he has only
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:48.240]   one day to work with. You could learn the same truths by studying Aristotle's ethics carefully,
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.480]   but watching Groundhog Day repeatedly is a lot more fun.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   The essay you have just heard was written by Charles Murray, published in the Wall Street
