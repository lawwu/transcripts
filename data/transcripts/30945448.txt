[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.560]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.240]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.120]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.280]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.740]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.660]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.040]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.400]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.640]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.320]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.000]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.320]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.020]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.020]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.640]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.580]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.200]   Well, listeners, I'm excited today about our topic.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.780]   Our foundations year has drawn to a close,
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.880]   our challenge year is quickly coming to an end,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.480]   and all the fun end of the year specials
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.720]   are running through our community.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.760]   I want us to talk today for a few minutes
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.740]   about memory masters.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.600]   Many of you have kids who are in the middle
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.160]   of the memory master proofing process,
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.320]   but a lot of you are in community
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.520]   with these memory master people,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.120]   and you don't really know what the big deal is.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.000]   Or maybe your child has heard about Memory Master,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.640]   and they wonder if it's something they want to do.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.060]   And they ask you about it,
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.800]   and you think, I don't really know a lot about this.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.480]   I don't know if it's for our family.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.320]   I'm not sure how you get started.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.880]   I don't know if it's too late.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.320]   How would I go about finding more information?
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.480]   So today, I have two great guests with us.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.840]   I have Kelly Wilt with us today.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.640]   She has been immersed in the memory master world
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.360]   for a long time.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.960]   You may know her voice and her face
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.960]   as the emcee of the National Memory Master Competition.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.400]   So Kelly is gonna talk to us a little bit
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.520]   about memory master in general,
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.800]   and some of her experiences with National Memory Master.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.600]   But I have a real treat today.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.240]   I'm gonna get Kelly to introduce
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   the new National Memory Master Liaison,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.520]   Elise DeYoung.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.600]   And you're gonna get to know Elise,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.960]   and we're gonna answer all of your questions, maybe.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.120]   We're going to just encourage you,
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.200]   mamas and daddies and grandmas and students
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   to realize that memory masters are made, not born.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.640]   So everybody has the opportunity to become a memory master.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.840]   Kelly, I'm so glad to have you today.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.440]   Thank you for coming to share your expertise with us.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.640]   - Oh, friend, you know I love foundations
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.080]   and discussing anything foundations.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.800]   And memory master is simply a celebration
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.040]   of what our students have learned
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.320]   and what a delight to celebrate these good things.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.040]   And it is a very good thing also
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.640]   that I get to introduce you to my new friend,
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.720]   Elise DeYoung today.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.160]   Elise is our new liaison
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.320]   for the National Memory Master Competition.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.440]   And Elise has an advantage over me, Lisa.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.960]   I am merely the mother of a memory master,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.840]   but Elise actually graduated through Challenge 4
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.240]   and in her foundation's years,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.160]   she was a memory master herself.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.960]   - Oh, that is so cool.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.760]   - So I am excited to introduce her to you here today
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.360]   and to our listeners so that they can meet her
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.720]   and they can hear her perspective
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.080]   on the National Memory Master Competition.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.760]   - That is so exciting.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.400]   Elise, let me ask you this.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.320]   Do you remember anything
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.880]   about your memory master competition?
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.920]   - Thank you for asking, thank you for having me on.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920]   I really appreciate it.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.760]   I'm really glad.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.880]   - I was thinking back through this week
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.480]   as I was preparing for this episode
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.520]   and things definitely started to come back.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.280]   But the thing that really stuck with me all these years
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.960]   was the time that I spent with my mom.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.160]   And I want to encourage families
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.280]   who are thinking about doing this
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.360]   because it is so worth it.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.640]   Just for that fact,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.240]   I can remember us going through all the songs
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.560]   and the facts in the car, at the grocery store.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.400]   We used to drive and spend a lot of time at my dad's office
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.520]   and that was always lots and lots of fun.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.880]   So just our whole family together working on this.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.400]   And that is truly what I took away the most
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.640]   and what I would like to encourage parents with also.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.720]   - That is the most beautiful thing.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.120]   I love that.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.120]   And I really think, Elise,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.920]   that's a big encouragement to all of the families
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.400]   that are listening.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.840]   National Memory Master is, like Kelly said,
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.600]   a celebration of all the things
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.240]   that our students have learned.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.440]   But Elise, you've just reminded us
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.320]   that all of what we do as homeschoolers
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.200]   is a celebration of the relationships
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.360]   that God has led us to develop more deeply
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.560]   with our children and children with their parents
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.320]   as we become learners together.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.200]   So I really appreciate that.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.760]   Thank you for sharing it.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.600]   All right, Kelly,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.800]   let's get all the grammar of Memory Master laid out
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.920]   'cause I suspect we may have some listeners
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.320]   who don't really know what Memory Master is all about.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.880]   And I wanna be sure that we all are talking
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.560]   about the same things.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.760]   And so we want to give people a short definition
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.720]   so that as we continue our conversation,
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.480]   people can follow it and not think,
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.240]   now, wait, what is that?
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.560]   Okay.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.800]   Let's start at the very beginning.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.920]   What do we mean by memorize?
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.680]   Okay, so if you say to me
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.200]   that a Memory Master has to memorize
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.600]   all of the foundation's memory work from this year,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.200]   do you mean like word for word, verbatim,
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.080]   or kind of paraphrased or with help?
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.520]   Or what does memorize mean?
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.080]   I think this is a really great question
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.400]   because it can mean different things to different people.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.200]   And it can mean different things outside of this context
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.120]   as far as recalling information.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.880]   So for our Memory Masters in community,
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.880]   when we say memorize,
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.280]   basically what we're saying is
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.760]   they need to be able to recite effortlessly the information
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.440]   because we have seven different subjects of memory work
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.920]   and they are asked to recite these subjects
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.560]   in different ways to demonstrate
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.760]   their mastery over the content.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.640]   So I would say that probably would be the best definition
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.760]   that I could give,
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.720]   that they could recite in a way that is effortless,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.920]   that is easy, that they recall easily
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.880]   those facts that they've put to mind.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.400]   That is awesome.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.120]   Okay, now you did say that we,
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.480]   that they are able to recall
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.520]   and recite that information in different ways
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.640]   depending on the area.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.360]   So like, what about maps?
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.280]   In Memory Master, are they drawing a map
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.920]   while you sit there and watch them?
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.360]   Are they pointing to stuff on a drawn map?
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.040]   Are they naming locations?
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   What about that?
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.880]   Yeah, it's interesting to think through
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.040]   the different subjects
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.320]   and how do we express mastery in geography
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.640]   as opposed to reciting a fact.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.640]   So in geography, when a student is proofed,
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.040]   they will be asked to show me,
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.160]   the person would, proofing them would say,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.600]   "Show me this location."
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.680]   So example, an example would be,
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.680]   "Show me the Atlantic Ocean."
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.560]   And so the student would look at the map
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.920]   and they would put their finger down
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.280]   where they feel they,
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.360]   where they have memorized the location
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.960]   of the Atlantic Ocean,
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   as opposed to mixing up the response
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.320]   by also saying, "Tell me where,
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.360]   tell me what this is."
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.240]   And the director or the tutor
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.640]   or the parent or another adult,
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.920]   these are the four people
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.680]   who would be proofing this Memory Master
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.080]   through the process.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.160]   They would say, "Tell me what this is."
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.360]   And then the student would look at
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.680]   where their finger was pointing
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.400]   and would say, "Oh, that's the Atlantic Ocean."
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.040]   So demonstrating memory with geography
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.800]   is slightly different than perhaps
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.680]   with some of our other subjects of memory work,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.960]   like history or English grammar,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.080]   where the person who is doing the proofing
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.320]   might just simply ask the student,
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.360]   "Tell me about Charlemagne."
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.600]   Or, "Tell me about, you know,
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.840]   William the Conqueror."
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.120]   And a student would recite that information
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.640]   that they had memorized on that particular week
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.160]   in that cycle.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.960]   So for geography, it is a little different.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.200]   Another subject that is slightly different is math.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.160]   So just like with geography,
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.280]   we have a map for students
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.200]   to be able to utilize in math.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.080]   Our parents, if our students are under the age of nine,
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.920]   when they go through the proofing process,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.720]   they are able to skip count
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.240]   or recite the products of the multiplication tables
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.680]   that they're memorizing.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.600]   But once they get to the age of 10,
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.080]   they actually use a pack of multiplication flashcards,
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.520]   and they will look at the multiplication problem,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.880]   they'll recite it, and the answer.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.960]   So it's slightly different for a couple of our subjects.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.640]   For the most part,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.640]   it will involve the person who is doing the proofing
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.480]   simply asking the student the proof,
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.760]   which is part of the memory work,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.440]   and then having them respond.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.280]   - That's good.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.800]   That seems pretty clear.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.840]   And I think it's really good.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.800]   We recognize that different subjects
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.920]   may need to be proofed in different ways
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.480]   in order for the student to really establish their mastery.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.240]   So that's really good.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.480]   I know, now my girls came through foundations
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.440]   and memory master a really long time ago, okay?
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.440]   And so I know years ago in our community,
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.040]   especially for really young children,
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   there were subject matter masters
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.400]   instead of full memory masters.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.280]   Have you ever heard of that?
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.120]   - I have.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.160]   And I think it's a natural tendency
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.720]   to gravitate toward what we love first.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.320]   So as children, your child may listen to the memory work
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.880]   and he or she may be drawn into those history songs
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.640]   or the timeline song.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.440]   And that may be the thing that they love
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.920]   that they want to sing at Thanksgiving dinner
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.520]   for the entire family.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.240]   And so perhaps some of the other memory work
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.440]   isn't fully cemented yet into their memory.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.800]   But that one particular subject for sure is
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   because they delight in it
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.400]   and they want to share what they've memorized.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.240]   And so a subject master would be a student
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.800]   who perhaps had mastered some of the subjects,
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.640]   but not all of them, as opposed to a memory master,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.840]   which would be a foundation student
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.000]   who could effortlessly recite
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.840]   the entire cycles worth of memory work.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.900]   - Lovely, lovely, okay.
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.900]   So Elise, what's the difference between a memory master
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.060]   and a national memory master?
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.340]   - Yeah, that is a great question.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.420]   One of the major differences is that memory master
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.740]   takes each cycle on its own
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.460]   and students are mastering cycles one, two,
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.900]   and three individually.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.820]   And a national memory master,
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.980]   students actually pull information from all three cycles,
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.660]   all at once during this competition.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.220]   And so they have worked for years and years and years
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.860]   to cement, like Kelly said,
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.460]   all of that information together.
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.940]   So it's kind of triple the work,
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.260]   but it's triple the fun also, I think.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.020]   It has a large diversity from ancient civilizations
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.540]   to medieval all the way up to our present day
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.260]   in American history.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.860]   But that allows students to really get the full scope
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.260]   of our memory work into one competition.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.460]   - Man, that is like, seriously, y'all,
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.380]   that is very impressive.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.220]   I know when our family first found out
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.700]   about Classical Conversations,
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.140]   and we started, I think we started,
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.660]   the year that we got involved, we were in cycle two.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.900]   And I looked at all of this information
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.620]   that my children were gonna learn in that year,
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.940]   and I was kind of blown away.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.740]   And I thought, yeah, well, we'll see.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.980]   And they did it, and I was so amazed, absolutely amazed.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.620]   But you're telling me that National Memory Masters,
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.620]   every year, they pull from all three cycles,
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.340]   not just the cycle that they've studied
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.780]   in community that year.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.580]   - Yes, that is the real trick with this.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.740]   It is amazing what these kids know.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.300]   Because when I share with other parents
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.220]   about National Memory Master,
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.660]   they're just simply blown away
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.820]   by the timeline song every time.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.140]   And then as soon as you start to expand
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.740]   and talk about English and Latin endings
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.140]   and all the history and the math,
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.180]   it just, it absolutely floors them every time.
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.420]   And it's amazing to see these kids,
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.980]   they really have mastered it.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.180]   And it is a testament to the amazing brains
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.220]   that these young people have.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.780]   - And it is beautiful to think that they're able
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.780]   to sew all those facts together into a beautiful whole.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.140]   That's really amazing.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.140]   Okay, y'all have talked several times.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.740]   Both of you have said things about proofing.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.860]   And Kelly, you mentioned like four different people
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.020]   that the student would proof with.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.100]   Okay, what is a proof, and who would my child proof with,
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.060]   and when, and how much is proofed,
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.780]   and how do I navigate that as a parent?
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.820]   - This is quite the process.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.980]   So I'm glad you asked me that question.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.580]   And it's designed that way on purpose
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.300]   to celebrate our students, but also to protect them
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.100]   and to protect our families from any situations
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.620]   which might cause hurt, especially for our younger students
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.980]   who we want to love the act of memorizing.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.540]   We don't want them to dread it
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.220]   or to see it as something negative.
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.780]   We wanna celebrate all they've accomplished.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.580]   So a proof in a particular cycle has four parts.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.700]   The first part is proofing with a parent,
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.980]   which for a child, of course,
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.500]   is going to be the most comfortable.
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.780]   They're sitting with mom and dad, maybe on a sofa,
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.500]   and they're reciting all of their memory work
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.180]   from the entire cycle.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.260]   And during that proof, they actually are allowed
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.980]   three or fewer misses per subject.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.420]   So when we think about memorizing and perfection,
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.260]   they're not expected to be perfect with the parent proof.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.300]   They're expected to demonstrate for their parent
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.100]   the amount of knowledge that they've gleaned.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.980]   And truthfully, as a parent at that point,
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.460]   based on what you observe,
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.460]   you need to make a judgment call about,
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.420]   are we ready to do this with another adult
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.300]   who would be the second proof?
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.060]   And then also followed by the tutor
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.540]   of that particular child.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.820]   And then finally, the director.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.380]   So as a parent, you have an obligation
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.180]   to look at your child and say,
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.620]   am I comfortable moving forward in this process?
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.740]   Or do I need to ask myself some hard questions about,
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.660]   do we need to delay this one more year
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.380]   and just wait for a little more maturity
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.380]   or a little more understanding
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.380]   or whatever you perceive to be the need in the situation?
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.060]   If your child goes through that first process at home
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.780]   with flying colors,
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.420]   and you are assured they're ready to move forward,
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.340]   the second proof is with another adult.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.500]   So we're distancing away from the parent,
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.740]   maybe putting the child in a situation
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.660]   where there would be a little less personal comfort
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.940]   so that they're relying on their memory
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.780]   in a different environment.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.420]   And during that proof,
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.700]   they will also again,
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.860]   proof 100% of the memory work from that particular cycle.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.700]   But in that proof,
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.500]   they're only allowed one miss per subject.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.500]   So again, we're emphasizing mastery
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.980]   over perfection at this point.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.980]   Still trying to build to that place
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.300]   where we know that they have completely memorized
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.220]   the information.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.780]   Now again, at this point,
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.980]   a parent should look at this proof and say,
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.860]   okay, we're doing well,
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.580]   or maybe we need to wait.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.580]   If they fly through that proof
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.500]   and they do an outstanding job,
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.180]   the third proof is with the student's tutor.
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.940]   And again, that's 100% of the information
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.780]   for that particular cycle.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.780]   But in that proof with the tutor
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.220]   who has built a relationship with that student
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.860]   over the course of the year in community,
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.460]   they are allowed no misses at all.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.060]   So at this point in this proof with the tutor,
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.860]   they are expected to have perfection,
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.540]   perfect memory over the content of that particular cycle.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.700]   And if a student passes that tutor proof,
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.300]   which could take two to three hours
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.140]   based on the amount of information proofed
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.140]   over the course of an entire cycle,
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.060]   the student would then be passed
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.660]   to the director of the community.
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.660]   And the director proof is different in several ways.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.660]   One of those being that
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.020]   the student is not proofing 100% of the content.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.860]   The director-
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.700]   - 'Cause they've already done that.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.860]   They've already done that. - Exactly.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.500]   They've done it three times.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.740]   So by the time they get to the director,
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.260]   it really is a celebratory proof
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.660]   where the director selects 25% of the content at random
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.420]   from that particular cycle and proofs the student,
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.540]   obviously with no misses.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.420]   And if a student passes that proof with no misses,
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.940]   then he or she is declared a memory master in community
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.540]   for that particular cycle.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.700]   But you can see, Lisa,
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.980]   how each proof is protecting the heart and mind of the student
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.380]   which is one of the things that I think is so valuable
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.980]   for our students that we are encouraging a spirit of grace
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.460]   over this process that hopefully will encourage them
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.020]   if they do not pass a particular proof
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.500]   that they'll wanna try again.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.340]   - Exactly.
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.540]   It's a stretching.
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.940]   It gives you a stretch goal every year.
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.860]   I love so many things about this.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.700]   Two things, especially.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.300]   One, that it does provide a stretch goal
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.740]   for students and families every year.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.340]   And so somebody who says, "I really wanna do this,
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.100]   "but I'm pretty sure I'm not perfect."
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.620]   They can still be part of this process.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.460]   - Right.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.780]   - And then the other thing that I really love
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.980]   is that parents are in charge.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.980]   I mean, CC is a wonderful, wonderful community,
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.340]   but we exist to support parents, not to supplant parents.
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.980]   And so I love it that you emphasize
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.820]   that at every juncture,
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.740]   at every part of the proofing process,
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.220]   parents are encouraged to decide
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.980]   whether they and their child should go on
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.580]   or whether it doesn't fit your family's mission
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.900]   for this year to go on.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.740]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.180]   - I love that.
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.580]   Such a good thing.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.900]   Okay, so you were very clear.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.780]   You answered a bunch of questions.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.060]   You answered the questions of how our students
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.980]   are prompted to give their responses
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.660]   and to demonstrate their mastery.
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.860]   And so that was really good.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.220]   And you gave us clear answers
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.820]   about how many mistakes are allowed,
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.820]   how much help is allowed at each of those parts of the thing.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.140]   And so the goal for a memory master
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   is 100% mastery recited effortlessly
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.300]   in all subject areas.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.500]   - Yes, that is a great definition.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.460]   - I love it, I love it, I love it.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:31.460]   Okay, so I look back and when our family got started,
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:36.860]   there was memory master at the local level,
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.540]   but there was no national memory master.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.860]   When did national memory master develop?
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.660]   - National memory master was developed in 2016.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.660]   So we've been in existence for almost a decade now,
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.860]   which is pretty amazing to think about.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.780]   And it was designed to celebrate these students
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.780]   who delight in the act of memory so much
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.340]   that they were able to memory master repeatedly.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.740]   And so as Elise said, national memory master
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.380]   is community memory master on steroids
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.900]   for our children who are supremely gifted
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.500]   in the art of memory.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.300]   And to celebrate what they have learned in foundations
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.540]   and cement that knowledge before they move forward
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.020]   into our Challenge A program the following fall.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.540]   So it is designed specifically for those students
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.020]   who are in their final year of foundations
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.020]   and who have mastered repeatedly
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.980]   and who are ready to move on literally and figuratively
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.500]   to the next challenge in their Classical Conversations years.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.500]   - Okay, so what if my family just got involved
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:58.580]   in Classical Conversations this year
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:03.340]   and I have a last year of foundation students
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:08.340]   who has really dug in and just this really clicked with them
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.980]   and they had no trouble memorizing
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.180]   and they've even gone back and were sad
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.620]   that they missed other cycles.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.660]   And so we've been doing the other cycles.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.660]   Could that student try to become a national memory master?
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.660]   - So one of the requirements for national memory master
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.900]   is that students have successfully proved
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.140]   for as a memory master two years,
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.580]   including the one that they are in,
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.500]   the one that they're seeking to be a memory
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.140]   or a national memory master in.
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.020]   So that student due to that rule
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.860]   would not be allowed to participate
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.540]   because there just needs to be at least two years of mastery
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.060]   prior to the competition.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.260]   So that would be just a little disclaimer there,
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.740]   but yeah, so this competition is definitely something
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.740]   that students have to really look forward to
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.460]   and kind of anticipate and prepare for before they go.
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.620]   - You know what, that's a really,
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.220]   and that may be a disappointment to some families,
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.060]   but you know what?
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.820]   In the spirit of celebrating the growing knowledge
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.740]   that our children are building through the years,
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.820]   I think it's a great thing that,
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.980]   I love what you just said,
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.060]   that it is something that our students can look forward to.
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.740]   They look ahead to that
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.660]   and it becomes their own private stretch goal.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.660]   It's like, okay, so now I have three more years
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.780]   of foundations and so I need to memory master,
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:34.860]   I need to memory master,
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.660]   and then I could be a national memory master.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.500]   That's really cool.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.700]   - What is so cool about this then is it,
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.620]   like you've been saying,
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.440]   it really gives us a chance to celebrate these students.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.300]   Like in this year's competition,
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.860]   we have a student who successfully proved
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.180]   as a memory master eight times up until this point.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.020]   (laughs)
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.420]   - My word.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.220]   - Yes, it is just amazing what these kids have done.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.820]   So these, they have really been looking forward
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.620]   to this opportunity for years and years and years
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.820]   and have spent so much time preparing.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.220]   And it really shows.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.340]   These kids are absolutely amazing.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.500]   And so that's one of the purposes for this competition
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.940]   is to highlight those students
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.580]   who have just fallen in love with memory work.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.220]   As I was thinking back on my experience,
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.780]   I was talking to my mom and I was like,
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.580]   well, when I was in foundations,
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.420]   I didn't even know national memory master was a thing.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.980]   And she goes, oh, I did.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.060]   (laughs)
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:35.420]   And she was saying how I just didn't have that same desire
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.620]   and love to really get after it.
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.500]   And I loved proofing and I really loved Kelly,
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.780]   what you said before about who is proofing you
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.660]   and how you already have a relationship.
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.580]   Because I remember sitting in that room,
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.340]   scared out of my mind because I'm a big perfectionist.
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.220]   I really wanted to do it all the way.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.660]   But just looking across the table
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.820]   and knowing this parent, this person, this director
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.300]   knows me and cares about me and wants me to succeed.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.220]   And so I do not regret memory master in any capacity.
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.980]   It was an amazing experience.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.860]   But I know there are a lot of kids out there
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.260]   who might be like I was, where it was a great experience.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.780]   I learned so much.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.380]   I learned how to memorize.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.420]   But that might be my big success.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.780]   That might be their big success.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.420]   And that is a big success.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.380]   And so National Memory Master specifically
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.100]   is for those kids who just treasure this experience
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.220]   and who have that competitive side to them where they just
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.020]   want to get after it and do their very best.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.380]   And that's what's so special about this competition.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.820]   I really like that.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.420]   I want-- listeners, what I hope that you are hearing,
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.060]   because this is what I'm hearing,
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:51.500]   is that we really want to celebrate these students who
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.900]   have learned all of this material
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.620]   and they are able to recite all of this material
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.420]   and they will blow away your relatives at the family
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.620]   reunion, OK?
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.120]   Yes.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.780]   It is absolutely fine if your student does not
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.740]   have that burning desire in the belly
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.420]   to be a National Memory Master.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:19.780]   In fact, it could be for anyone, but it's not for everyone.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.380]   Everybody is not going to love that.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:28.220]   Because what I hear you saying, Elise, and what I've observed,
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.500]   is that there are other skills involved
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:36.380]   in becoming a National Memory Master besides just
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.300]   the ability to memorize.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.780]   You really do have to have that fire in the belly
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.140]   competitive edge.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.180]   And the other thing, y'all, that I have noticed,
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:53.140]   these National Memory Master candidates have to be showmen.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.700]   I mean, they have to want to perform.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:00.780]   It's not just standing up and reciting all the information.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.340]   These kids like to be showmen.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.980]   Would you agree with that, having
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:08.860]   seen the competition up close?
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.500]   Yes, so I definitely agree with that.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.660]   Here are some-- I'll give you some logistics
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.580]   of the competition that really showcase
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.980]   what you're talking about.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.700]   The competition is divided up into two rounds.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.220]   The first round is in the form of a memory bee,
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.740]   so very similar to a spelling bee.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.100]   And that really is more of the recitation.
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.460]   Each child goes up to the microphone one at a time
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.260]   and recites a fact.
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.500]   And then for round two, we really
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.660]   get into more of that rhetoric phase, that showmanship
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.140]   you were talking about, where they get the chance
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.820]   to draw and label the entire world map, which is amazing.
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.220]   All in 30 minutes, no less.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.820]   And it is insane.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.300]   I remember in Challenge A, I also had to do that.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.620]   But it took me a lot longer than 30 minutes,
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.620]   if I'm being completely honest.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.620]   So these kids, it blows me away every time I think about it.
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.820]   But then another thing that they do
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:14.020]   is they will end up creating a creative story based off
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.340]   of a prompt that includes 12 memory facts that will give
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.580]   them the day of.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.340]   And they have 20 minutes to put together
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.540]   this amazing, exciting story, including all those facts.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.900]   And then they turn around and present it to the judges.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.580]   And this is really one of the moments
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:31.020]   where we get to see their individual personalities
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.700]   and what they love.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.580]   Because they can really talk about anything,
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.020]   as long as they include all these facts.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:41.300]   And so some kids might set it up as a podcast like this,
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.300]   or a sporting event, or something like that.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.700]   And you get to see their individual twist on the facts.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.660]   And it's just a really cool experience.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.260]   And the kids have a lot of fun with it.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.900]   Lisa, I'm sitting here as Elise is describing this.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.860]   And I'm also thinking about another component
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.540]   of the Foundations Day, which really
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.860]   helps feed into skills that are being presented.
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.740]   And that's weekly presentations in community.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.780]   Because this is not something that
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.020]   is foreign to our Foundation students.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.860]   Each cycle, they get 24 opportunities
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:15.140]   to present in this same manner within the community space,
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.060]   in front of their friends, and their parents,
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.180]   and their tutors.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.860]   And so they're naturally getting memory master practice
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.620]   throughout the weeks of a particular cycle,
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.020]   simply by completing weekly presentations.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.980]   It's so wonderful.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:29.620]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.740]   Yes.
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.060]   So you're right.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.940]   It's built into the program.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:40.060]   We stroke these skills every week,
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.180]   providing opportunities for our children
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.460]   to grow in those skills.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.500]   That's really awesome.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.580]   I know that there is a mom or dad who's listening.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.700]   And they have been listening to all of the things
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.820]   that memory masters do, and all of the things
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.500]   that national memory masters do.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.060]   And I know that there are some parents who are thinking,
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.460]   hmm, I could never do that in a million years.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.180]   Is it too much pressure for little kids?
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.900]   How would you answer that, Kelly?
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.900]   And then I want your input too, Elyse,
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.380]   because you have been one of those little kids.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.260]   Well, Elyse and I have joked several times
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.060]   that we know that memory masters are not robots.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.860]   They're real children.
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.340]   And I think this, again, goes back
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.820]   to what we were saying earlier.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.060]   This process is in the hands of the parent.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.580]   As a parent, you know your child best.
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.860]   You know what will help your child to stretch.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.820]   And you know what will cause your child to snap.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.740]   And so there may be portions of the memory work
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.220]   which may feel stressful to your child.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.380]   And you, as a parent, will have to intervene and assess, OK,
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.300]   is this going to be a growing opportunity,
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.620]   a stretching opportunity for our family this year?
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.260]   Or, as we said earlier in the podcast,
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.940]   are we going to hit pause--
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.340]   not stop, but are we going to hit pause on this process--
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.460]   and celebrate what we have accomplished,
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.980]   and then perhaps have a discussion or a conversation
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:17.020]   before the next cycle about what is our goal?
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.220]   What's our goal as a family?
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.860]   Exactly.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.580]   Is this something that we want to take on together?
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.780]   Because I will be honest with you, Elyse,
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.380]   it is the parents who wholeheartedly embrace
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.220]   that memory work, and even want to master it themselves,
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.260]   who often ignite the enthusiasm of their children
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.820]   to want to compete with them to be
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.540]   able to master the memory work.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.660]   So as a parent, you just never know
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.940]   how much you're paying forward by going, you know what?
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.940]   Hey, guys, listen to me recite the multiplication facts,
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.940]   or I can tell you where this week's memory
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.140]   work in geography is located on the map.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.540]   Come here, let me show you.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:05.220]   And your child will rise to that expectation of enthusiasm
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.060]   and involvement.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.260]   So parents, if you have a question about are
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.980]   they interested or not, lead the way,
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.660]   and you'll find out pretty quickly.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.620]   My children delighted, absolutely delighted,
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.140]   in being able to assemble the timeline cards faster than me.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.660]   Oh, yes.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.180]   And so I totally agree with you.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.060]   Elyse, what would you say?
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.380]   How will we know if it's just too much?
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.820]   Well, in regards to Memory Master,
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:36.380]   I would tell parents, if I did it, your child can, too.
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:42.780]   But I love what Kelly said about the assessment process,
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   because the purpose of Memory Master and National Memory
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:53.060]   Master is really just to prepare children to love to learn,
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.140]   like to teach them to love knowledge and information,
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.620]   and to teach them to remember it.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.860]   I mean, as an adult now, looking back, I'm not in school anymore.
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.220]   And I often ask myself the question,
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.260]   how much do I know without Google,
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.100]   without my cell phone on me?
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.700]   And that is such an important question that we, as adults,
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.060]   should ask ourselves.
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.180]   And we are training these students
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.100]   to not have to ask that question,
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:23.780]   because they will know how to take in information,
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.060]   and to really chew on it, and to learn from it,
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.660]   and then retain it, and be able to share it with others.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.900]   And I think that's one of the most special things
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.820]   about this competition, is those family dinners, where students
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.780]   can share with grandparents, and cousins, and friends,
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.540]   and all that, what they've learned.
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.700]   And that should really be the end goal of these families.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.860]   And if that leads them to the Memory Master
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.980]   title or the National Memory Master title,
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.220]   then that is an amazing accomplishment.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.780]   And we want to celebrate them and give all the glory to God.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.180]   But if that just means that they're a subject matter
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.740]   expert, or if they just get through the year
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.220]   and are happy with what they've done,
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.100]   that is a success as well.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.420]   And I think that that is the encouragement
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.820]   that parents should know.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.300]   Because it is a competition with National Memory Master,
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.420]   but it's just mainly just a celebration.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.860]   I love that that's been brought up so many times,
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.140]   because it's so true.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:25.060]   Elyse, you did a great job of summing this up
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.500]   by really helping us, as parents,
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.580]   see what the purpose of this is.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.820]   And I love it.
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:36.060]   It's to teach kids to love knowledge and information,
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:41.260]   and to remember it, and then to chew on it, and to connect it,
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.940]   and then to share it.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.500]   I love the way you situated Memory Master as something
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   that families can do together, whether they
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.980]   are the child trying to remember all those facts,
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.580]   or the parent helping the child to remember all those facts.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.780]   And how many of us, as parents, know way more than we ever
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:03.180]   intended to know, because we had to prove somebody?
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.740]   We heard it a million times ourselves.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:10.700]   So it is a way of learning as a family.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.380]   But the main thing, parents, that we want you to know
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.340]   is that National Memory Master and Memory Master
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:23.100]   within your community is a way of celebrating
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:29.500]   what our students have done over this year or over several years
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.620]   to learn to know God and to make Him known.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.300]   Ladies, thank you so much for sharing.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.980]   I actually have a few more questions
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.660]   about how we can decide whether or not--
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.100]   and if we decide that maybe we're
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.460]   going to want to try this next year, what are some things
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.420]   we can do maybe this summer?
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.780]   Or as the year begins, would you guys
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.060]   be willing to come back another time soon and talk to me?
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.780]   Absolutely.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:04.100]   I feel like we left some stones unturned.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.300]   And maybe we've gotten some people thinking
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.580]   who will want to spend the summer laying out
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.020]   a plan of attack or a plan of family learning
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.540]   that can be easy and gentle.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:18.420]   So I'm going to get you guys to come back.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.860]   And listeners, just look for that podcast
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.460]   in the next several weeks.
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.180]   As you go about your week, as you
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.820]   go about whether or not you're practicing for National Memory
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.780]   Master or for Community Memory Master--
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.740]   I know you've got a lot planned this week--
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.660]   I want to give you a heads up to one thing
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.460]   you might want to look toward doing on Friday.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:48.500]   I want to let you know about a movie premiere of April 26.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.860]   We are making Family Day at the theater.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:56.300]   So there is a movie coming out called Unsung Hero.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.740]   It's from the creators of the Jesus Revolution.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:04.940]   Unsung Hero is about somebody that you young moms and dads
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.500]   might actually know.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.700]   It's the Smallbone family.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.620]   They are from Australia.
