[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.040]   - We bid farewell to the 20 teens
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.280]   with a question from Kevin, still a teen,
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.120]   an 18 year old listener who has a brand new Bible
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.080]   and a great question for you.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.800]   Hello, Pastor John, my parents just bought me
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.040]   a new ESV journaling Bible,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.560]   interleaved edition for Christmas.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.240]   It has a full blank page between each Bible page,
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.920]   which sounds a lot like Jonathan Edwards' blank Bible.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.160]   I'm truly delighted to have it and to begin using it.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.280]   I'm hoping it helps me reflect more on God's word
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.860]   and to be more consistent about spending time with him.
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.220]   The hangup is this, I've never written in my Bible before.
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.500]   So having blank pages for notes
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.840]   is brand new territory for me.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.060]   What should I write down?
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.440]   Should it be a place to document my current discoveries?
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.680]   Would it be useful to look back
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.200]   on how God was working in my life,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.620]   a spiritual diary of sorts?
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.840]   Should I date my entries?
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.680]   Stuff like that.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.040]   How would you go about doing this, Pastor John?
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.040]   - Kevin, you are about to embark on something astonishing.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.800]   It could absolutely change your life in very profound ways.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.840]   The word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.680]   It pierces to the division of soul and spirit,
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.120]   bone and marrow.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.080]   It searches out your heart.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.160]   The hidden things you don't even know are there.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.680]   It's full of liberating, sanctifying power.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.840]   Nothing else will be as transforming in your life
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.560]   as the word of God pursued in regular, disciplined,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.680]   focused, prayerful ways through this process
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.420]   of writing down what you see in God's word.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.560]   So I'm very excited for you.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.960]   So let's get a few nitty gritty things out of the way,
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.360]   and then I'll mention four things
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.560]   that I think will give solid foundation and guidance
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.280]   for this practice of journaling.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.040]   Yes, date your entries.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.680]   Later, you will see amazing correlations
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.760]   between what you saw on a date
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.560]   and what God was doing in your life at that time.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.960]   Use a pencil, not a pen.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.380]   You need to be able to erase and correct.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.720]   So get an automatic number two pencil with 0.5 lid,
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.360]   not 0.7, 0.5.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.040]   It needs to be tiny enough to fit a lot on the page,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.300]   and it needs to have an eraser.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.680]   So decide on the size of your margins.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.240]   Fill up the space in between.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.160]   Here's something you may not have thought of.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.000]   Create an overflow system for when you want
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.800]   to write more than can fit on a page.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.120]   And I would say start a notebook.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.040]   It might be paper.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.720]   I did this 40 years ago.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.360]   I call them sermon gardens,
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.200]   because I heard somebody say that,
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   and it was a spiral binder,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.040]   sermon garden number one, sermon garden number two.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.000]   It's just where I jotted down ideas that I had seen,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.560]   'cause I didn't have one of those journaling Bibles.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.520]   Or it might be a word processor document,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.120]   and name it journal Bible overflow number one,
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.160]   and then number the entries inside it
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.680]   as one, two, three, and so on.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.640]   So when you leave the blank journal Bible page
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.240]   and go to your overflow,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.800]   you correlate it with notebook number one,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.300]   entry number one, so 1.1 or something like that.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.720]   So those are my nitty gritties.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   Get those out of the way right away.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.240]   Now here are my four suggestions
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.060]   for foundation and guidance.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.280]   And I've thought of a way to put them in four P's,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.040]   perceive, present, preserve, plan.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.780]   So perceive.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.600]   Paul said in Ephesians 3, 4,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.440]   in reading this, you can perceive,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.520]   here's my first P,
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.200]   you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.720]   This is astonishing.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.560]   Just think of it.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   God has ordained that by the ordinary human act of reading,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.040]   the human mind can penetrate into the mystery of Christ.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.640]   It is a work of God in our minds.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.680]   The spirit must be doing a decisive work
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.000]   in our minds and hearts,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.040]   but reading is the human means
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   that God has appointed for how that work happens.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.920]   So what I want to add to that statement of Paul
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   is that there are eyes in the tip of your pencil.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.560]   There are eyes in the tip of your pencil.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   And these eyes cause your reading to detect so much more.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.700]   Calvin said, and I say the very same thing,
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.800]   and I think you'll probably wind up saying it too.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.960]   I count myself among the number
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   of those who write as they learn and learn as they write.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.160]   That's exactly what you'll find,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.000]   that as you write, you see,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.080]   as you write, you learn.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.840]   You will find, I promise you this,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   you will find that writing does not just record what you see,
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.080]   it increases what you see, what you perceive.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.680]   So here's what I would write.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.640]   Number one, I would write paraphrases
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.520]   in your own words of the verses that arrest your attention.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.580]   That will force questions.
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.360]   Trying to paraphrase it will force questions
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.600]   about meanings of words and phrases
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.800]   and how things connect with each other.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.840]   And second, write those questions down.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.280]   Third, write possible answers to your questions.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.180]   Fourth, write arguments that favor one answer
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.320]   over the other.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.640]   Fifth, write the insights that come to you
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.920]   as you wrestle with these questions and these answers.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.780]   There's a lot more, but that's enough
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.240]   to get you started with great fruitfulness.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.640]   So the first reason for writing, for journaling,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.400]   is that there are eyes in the tip of your pencil
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.360]   and you will perceive more because of your writing.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.880]   You will learn as you write
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.680]   and you will see as you seek to say.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.600]   Here's number two, present.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.520]   Ecclesiastes, chapter 12, verse 10 says,
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.080]   the preacher, that's the author of Ecclesiastes,
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   the preacher sought to find words of delight
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.160]   and uprightly he wrote words of truth.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.600]   So what did he do in his journal?
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.440]   What did he do?
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.360]   He sought, he sought, it says.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.640]   What did he seek?
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.720]   He sought words.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.400]   He did not just write the first words
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.120]   that came to his head, right?
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.360]   He sought.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.000]   A word came to his head and he said,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.240]   no, I'm gonna seek another word.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.560]   So he paused, he ransacked his experience
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.000]   and his memory for special words.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.840]   What kind of words?
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.880]   Words that delight.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.120]   Proverbs 25, 11 says, a word fitly spoken
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.980]   is like apples of gold in a setting of silver.
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.120]   That means they really are pleasing.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.600]   These words are pleasing.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.360]   When somebody says them at a right moment,
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.680]   at a right time, in a right way,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.280]   they're just like a great meal.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.080]   Somebody has said a word and it felt and tasted so good.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.080]   They create a good effect in the hearer.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.840]   So do this.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   Pause and seek a better word, a better phrase,
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.220]   one that surprises and awakens
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.720]   and causes a kind of pleasure.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.640]   Yes, even in your own mind,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.760]   even if it shocks and rebukes.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.880]   But there's another trait, he said,
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.060]   that the words are supposed to have.
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.080]   He said, uprightly, he wrote words of truth.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.080]   So strive to write with words that are true and beautiful.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.920]   And yes, I am suggesting that you
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.080]   not just write for yourself.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.640]   I know that may sound a little odd,
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.640]   maybe even a little presumptuous.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.240]   Imagine a person or a group, a wife, a child,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.480]   a husband, whatever.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.400]   Imagine, this is Kevin we're talking to,
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.440]   so don't imagine a husband.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.440]   Imagine a wife who is gonna read what you write
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.800]   or a group of people and write for them too.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.240]   God loves to give wisdom to those
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.520]   who plan to share his wisdom.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.680]   Let me say that again.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   God loves to give fresh sight and wisdom
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.480]   to those who long to share his wisdom with others.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.120]   So that's why I use the word present.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.800]   Number three, preserve.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.040]   Psalm 103, verse two says,
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.720]   "Bless the Lord, O my soul,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.200]   and forget not all his benefits."
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.600]   So inevitably, it seems to me, we forget things.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   There are thousands of blessings
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.160]   God will bring into your life every month of your life,
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.720]   millions every year,
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.680]   and you will not remember most of them.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.860]   It's impossible to remember millions of blessings
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.120]   that God brings into your life.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.400]   You can't even see them when they're happening sometimes.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   So I take this to mean, remember all kinds of benefits,
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.560]   and journaling is one way to do that.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.960]   Remember what he has taught you.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.800]   Write it down.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.960]   Peter said he wrote his two letters, his two epistles,
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.040]   to help people remember what the Lord had taught.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.420]   We need written reminders.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.800]   The Bible is a witness to the fact
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.920]   that we need written reminders.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.560]   So create them for yourself.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.920]   And lastly, plan.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.840]   All I mean here is choose ahead of time
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.200]   what you're gonna be reading
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.460]   for the week or the month or the year.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.960]   If you intend to write regularly,
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.880]   you won't be able to comment on lots of chapters.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.920]   For starters then, it seems to me,
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.280]   perhaps pick a short book like Colossians or Philippians
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.320]   and plan to read a section a day and write about it
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.520]   as I suggested above.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.720]   And then you'll learn from experience
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.280]   how your reading and your writing flow together.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.100]   So I'm excited for you, Kevin.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.600]   Francis Bacon said, "Reading makes a fool man.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.340]   "Conference," meaning conversation, "makes a ready man.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.680]   "Writing makes an exact man."
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.180]   The world suffers today way too much
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.880]   from ambiguity and carelessness
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.660]   and inexactness and imprecision.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.660]   But writing makes a penetratingly perceiving man
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.500]   and a creatively presenting man
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   and a worshipfully persevering and preserving man
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.120]   and an exact man, and we need that.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.060]   - Yes, we sure do.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.260]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.220]   And thank you for the question, Kevin.
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.700]   Well, 2020 is upon us now.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.660]   It's surreal.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.180]   I mean, this is the mythical year
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.420]   from all of the sci-fi books and movies of my childhood.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.780]   2020 is here.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.060]   We were supposed to have flying cars and robotic maids
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.620]   and butlers and colonies on Mars.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.820]   Alas, but what we do have for you
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.460]   in your first taste of 2020,
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.980]   Pastor John is gonna make his case
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.660]   for why you need to set personal resolutions.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.720]   That's right, a defense of personal resolutions.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.360]   That's coming up on Wednesday.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.580]   We'll see you in the future.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:05.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
