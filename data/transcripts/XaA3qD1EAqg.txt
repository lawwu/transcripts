[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   [silence]
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.520]   We are, however, going to talk about the practical steps
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.440]   that you can take to make sure that you're getting
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.160]   the most brain benefits from your exercise.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.920]   Based on what we've talked about so far,
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.320]   as well as a broad survey of the literature,
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.200]   and again, it is a big literature,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.960]   here are the four things that I believe
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.980]   everyone should be doing every single week
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.680]   in terms of their exercise program.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.140]   I believe that everybody should include
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.440]   both resistance training,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.200]   could be body weight, free weights, machines,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.720]   some combination of those,
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.440]   as well as cardiovascular training each week.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.460]   And that the cardiovascular training should include
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.480]   both high intensity interval training,
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.600]   at least once per week,
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.080]   and some so-called long slow distance training
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.600]   or zone two type training each week.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.400]   Whatever exercise you happen to be doing
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.840]   or you happen to be planning,
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.360]   I do believe it should include four things
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.580]   specifically to improve brain health and performance.
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.400]   Although these four things will also benefit you
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.400]   at the level of your bodily health, no doubt.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.120]   The first thing is to include at least one workout per week
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.940]   that is of a long slow distance nature.
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.240]   So zone two type cardio,
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.440]   maybe you get a little bit up into zone three,
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.660]   but basically jogging, swimming, rowing,
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.200]   any activity that you can carry out consistently
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.620]   for 45 to 75 minutes without getting injured, right?
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.960]   People always say, "Well, do I have to run?"
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.280]   No, if you don't like running
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.820]   and running's too hard on your body,
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.280]   or you'll get injured, then do something else.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.120]   Maybe you do the row,
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.500]   or maybe you ride a stationary bike,
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.560]   maybe you ride a road bike.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.280]   But at least one long slow distance training session per week
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.480]   is going to be very beneficial for brain health
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.880]   because of the way that it impacts cerebral blood flow
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.280]   and to theological health,
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.040]   and basically the way that cardiovascular health
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.520]   improves brain function.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.000]   The second thing is to include
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.600]   at least one workout per week
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.760]   that's of the so-called high intensity interval training
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.720]   type.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.480]   Now, there are a lot of different types
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.040]   of high intensity interval training out there.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.940]   In fact, Dr. Andy Galpin says,
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.120]   we'll hear about say like the four by four by four protocol,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.960]   right?
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.200]   Four minutes of going as hard as you can for four minutes,
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.560]   basically where there's no variation in the intensity
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.640]   through that whole four minutes,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.200]   you're going hard the whole four minutes,
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440]   but only as hard as you can for the entire four minutes,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.720]   then resting four minutes,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.640]   and then repeating that four by four cycle four times.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.640]   Okay, so that's one way to do it.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.600]   But Dr. Andy Galpin would be the first to tell you
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.660]   that you probably also get great results
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.180]   from a three by three by four type of workout,
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.380]   or a six by six by six type of workout.
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.120]   And generally when one finishes that type of workout,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.500]   your heart rate is very, very elevated.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.120]   Now, I don't tend to track my heart rate during exercise,
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.960]   perhaps I should,
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.840]   but I don't like to get too weighed down with technology
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.900]   when I exercise.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.000]   I like to go more on feel, that's just me.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.860]   I find that my heart rate is extremely high
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.600]   right as I get off that thing,
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.200]   but five minutes later, it's back to baseline.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.480]   And I certainly feel energized after doing that
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.560]   to go do some cognitive work,
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.400]   to shower up and to head to work, that sort of thing.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.760]   So pick a high intensity interval training session
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.760]   that you can do at least once per week,
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.040]   and that works for you.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.640]   And again, it's really important to pick a form of exercise
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.400]   for the high intensity interval training
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.320]   that you can do without getting injured.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.760]   This is so important.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.320]   One way to really limit your brain health and bodily health
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.260]   is to get injured and to not be able to exercise.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.200]   The third would be TUT, T-U-T, time under tension.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.620]   If you're doing resistance training,
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.620]   and I do believe everybody
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.100]   should be doing resistance training,
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.700]   there are a near infinite number of different ways
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.140]   to do resistance training, as you well know.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.780]   You can move the weight ballistically,
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.200]   you can control the eccentric,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.980]   you can do any number of different things,
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.700]   but some proportion of the exercises
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.300]   that you do during your resistance training
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.380]   during the week should include time under tension training,
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.500]   where you're really emphasizing the contraction
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.060]   of the muscles, the slow lowering of the weight,
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.840]   as well as the lifting of the weight,
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.520]   contracting the muscles as hard as you can.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.900]   And this is really to emphasize
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.380]   the nerve to muscle pathways
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.580]   and the way that time under tension
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.260]   promotes the release of things from muscles
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.280]   into the bloodstream that can positively impact the brain,
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.780]   as well as the way that focusing your brain on exercises
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.800]   such that you're isolating muscles,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.360]   or even if you're not doing a so-called isolation exercise,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.820]   maybe you're doing a compound exercise,
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.780]   like a dip, or a squat, or a deadlift,
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.700]   but that really concentrating on the muscles
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.620]   that are supposed to be managing the work
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.780]   and not just moving the weight,
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.140]   but challenging the muscles.
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.060]   This is a very important thing,
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.100]   challenging the muscles, using the weight,
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.460]   not lifting weights or moving weights.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.460]   By focusing on time under tension,
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.460]   you will, of course, get benefits
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.380]   as it relates to hypertrophy and strength increases,
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.740]   in particular, hypertrophy.
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.180]   And time under tension training is very beneficial
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.220]   for the deployment of the molecules
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.880]   that work both within the body,
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.180]   but also within the brain
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.300]   to support brain health and function,
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.340]   both in the short-term
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.180]   and most particularly in the long-term.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.980]   I tend to make a full third of my resistance training
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.500]   just focused on time under tension.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.820]   So if I do two exercises,
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.140]   typically the first exercise is a compound exercise.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.980]   So if it's a shoulder press, for instance,
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.020]   I'll do a couple of warmup sets and then the work sets.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.780]   I try and move the weight.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.260]   And generally, I tend to work pretty heavy in the,
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.300]   for me, heavy for me, in the four to eight repetition range.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.660]   I'll try and move the weight as quickly as I can
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.140]   on the concentric phase, the lifting phase,
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.900]   and then at least twice as slow on the lowering phase.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.420]   And then I pause while keeping the muscles under tension.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.000]   I never really set the weight down at all during a set,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.640]   if I'm doing my job, that is.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.300]   And then the second exercise that I do,
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.900]   I really focus even more on time under tension.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.900]   So whether or not it's a compound exercise
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.340]   or an isolation exercise,
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.820]   again, compound exercise, multiple joints moving,
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.100]   isolation exercise, single joints moving,
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.500]   I'll really concentrate on keeping the muscle
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.780]   under tension the entire time.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.140]   In fact, I'll lift the weight off the stack
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.020]   if it's a machine or if it's a free weight,
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.100]   just a little bit,
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.260]   engage the muscles that I'm trying to activate or train,
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.460]   and then keep it under tension throughout the concentric,
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.900]   the contraction, and the lowering of that weight,
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.620]   and then never actually set it down
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.140]   until the end of the set,
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.420]   AKA increasing the time under tension.
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.020]   And then the fourth category of exercise
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.660]   that I believe everybody should include
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.300]   in their existing workouts or add
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.300]   if you're not currently working out
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.660]   is some sort of explosive jumping and or eccentric landing.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.860]   Now the explosive jumping with eccentric landing,
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.540]   you could do on a mat, right?
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.820]   Most people won't do it on concrete
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.380]   because they're worried about impact, that sort of thing.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.540]   But let's say you have some mats or you're on a lawn
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.580]   or you're on dirt or you're jumping up onto a box
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.980]   as high as you can and then jumping down
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.420]   and controlling the eccentric portion.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.860]   Again, pick something that you can do safely,
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.100]   progress slowly, right?
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.020]   If you're going to jump up and off boxes,
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.460]   you want to start with low boxes.
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.900]   I know that many of you can jump quite high
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.620]   and I'm not one of those people,
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.260]   but if you can jump quite high
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.660]   and then you're going to jump off that box
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.940]   and you're going to do this as a new thing,
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.100]   you'll notice that anytime you add eccentric training
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.860]   to your workout regimen,
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.700]   it tends to increase soreness a lot.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.040]   And often people get injured
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.900]   by including a new form of movement,
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.460]   in particular, a form of movement that you can fall
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.060]   and/or not just falling,
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.440]   but by including a lot of eccentric movements
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.380]   that they hadn't been doing previously.
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.160]   Again, be really safe about this,
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.180]   but that loading of the skeleton through eccentric movement
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.180]   and controlling the descent, super important,
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.660]   not just for your body, not just to avoid falls,
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.560]   not just to improve coordination
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.940]   and a bunch of other great things,
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.100]   but also to get that release of osteocalcin,
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.760]   the improvements in BDNF,
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.300]   brain performance, brain health, and so on.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.460]   And I'm guessing that most of you
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.260]   can probably incorporate these four things,
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.020]   long, slow distance, high intensity interval training,
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.820]   some deliberate time under tension training
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.980]   during your resistance training,
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.180]   again, could be done with body weight,
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.380]   doesn't have to even be done with machines or free weights,
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.340]   as well as some explosive and eccentric control training
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.980]   without adding any time to your existing workout regimen,
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.900]   simply by incorporating it into whatever workouts
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.540]   you happen to already be doing.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.220]   And the explosive eccentric control training
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.920]   could be done, frankly, at the end of a run,
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.500]   you could do it at the end of your zone two day,
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.940]   you could do it on the end of a hit day,
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.900]   whenever you do it and however you do it,
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.980]   just try not to get injured.
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.500]   That's the most important thing.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.340]   Why?
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.940]   Well, it turns out if you get injured, you can't exercise.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.900]   Sometimes you can, and it's good to continue exercising
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.920]   provided you're not aggravating that injury,
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.460]   but a lot of times you can't.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.780]   And there are actually studies of how quickly
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.860]   your brain starts to suffer if you don't exercise.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.500]   Now, most of these studies have been done
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.540]   on very experienced athletes,
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.060]   or people that are exercising a lot
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.340]   and then are forced to detrain or stop training completely.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.360]   And in some of these studies,
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.060]   they've done this independent of anything else.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.500]   It's not like these people got sick from a, you know,
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.340]   a cold or flu and then had to stop training.
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.700]   They'll just have them train a lot and then stop training
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.360]   and then start to look at some of the effects
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.780]   that occur within the brain.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.580]   And the major thing that I was able to extract
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.040]   from that literature is that after about 10 days
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.800]   of not doing any training,
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.720]   that is no cardiovascular training, no resistance training,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.000]   you start to see significant decrements
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.120]   in brain oxygenation levels,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.400]   as well as some other markers
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.640]   that are indicative of brain health,
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.920]   or that would be indicative of brain health
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.580]   if they were to continue.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.220]   So if you haven't been training at all
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.560]   for a long period of time, your brain is suffering.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.040]   The good news is you can start benefiting your brain
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.480]   very quickly by exercising.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.400]   Okay, so I listed off the four types of training
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.840]   that you absolutely want to include
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.260]   in your exercise regimen
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.520]   if improving your brain health and performance
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.400]   is one of your goals.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.700]   And obviously that should be one of your goals.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.920]   Your brain is your central command center
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.180]   for your entire brain, but also your body.
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.020]   There's a fifth category of exercise
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.120]   that everyone should include
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.840]   if one's goal is to have a better and more resilient
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.240]   and indeed a better performing brain
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.080]   compared to your age match controls.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.000]   And to be direct, that fifth category is the one
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.160]   that you absolutely don't want to do.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.280]   What do I mean by that?
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.960]   Well, there's an absolutely beautiful literature
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.000]   about a brain area.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.400]   I've talked a little bit about this before in our episode
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.040]   about tenacity and willpower.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.340]   I've talked about it on a few other podcasts as well.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.360]   It came up during the podcast episode that I did
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.120]   with the one and only David Goggins.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.680]   And that brain area is the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.560]   The anterior mid-cingulate cortex, very briefly,
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.840]   is a brain area that is powerfully engaged
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.720]   when we lean into challenges,
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.140]   including physical challenges,
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.320]   but also mental challenges, emotional challenges.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.540]   And we get that, I'm going to push through tenacity
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.940]   and engaging our willpower.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.480]   There's a category of humans referred to as super-agers.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.840]   Super-agers are people that defy the aging process,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.600]   at least at the level of cognition.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.480]   They maintain the volume of certain brain areas
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.160]   well into older age when their age match counterparts
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.960]   are losing the same brain areas.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.040]   Meaning people in their 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.880]   have brain areas that are shrinking.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.440]   Even in cases where people don't have Alzheimer's dementia,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.800]   areas of the brain are shrinking.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.200]   Super-agers are people that maintain the healthy,
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.040]   full volume of these brain areas.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.440]   And indeed, in some cases, the volume,
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.880]   the size of these brain areas continues to increase
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.660]   into their later years.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.440]   One of the brain areas that maintains
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.760]   or increases volume in the super-agers
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.200]   is the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.820]   What can allow you to activate and increase the size
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.920]   of your anterior mid-cingulate cortex?
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   Well, it's very simple,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.640]   to do things that you don't want to do.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.480]   I should be very clear,
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.480]   we're talking about things that can be done safely
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.560]   that aren't going to damage you physically
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.400]   or psychologically, but we are talking about exercise
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.940]   or in some cases, cognitive exercise,
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.520]   but today we're talking about physical exercise
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.020]   that you would much rather not do.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.400]   So if you're like me and you love resistance training,
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.720]   it can be hard, right?
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   Some days I want to do it more than others.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.400]   And sometimes the workouts are much harder than others,
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.240]   but I love it.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.360]   But if I want to maintain and increase the size
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.900]   of my anterior mid-cingulate cortex,
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.340]   I absolutely have to find some form of physical exercise
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.320]   that I would much rather not do.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.360]   But as I mentioned before, that's also safe physically,
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.880]   and that's not going to damage me emotionally.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.200]   I don't know what kind of physical exercise
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.600]   would damage me emotionally, but you get the point.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.320]   So presumably most of you are doing some form of that.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.560]   So maybe you're doing more cardio than resistance training.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.980]   Maybe you're doing more resistance training than cardio.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.840]   If you're interested in a zero cost program
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.320]   where you can start to sculpt out a idealized program
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.440]   for you, but you want to start
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.080]   with a kind of general template,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.720]   we have a newsletter that you can access
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.560]   at hubermanlab.com, zero cost.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.120]   You don't even have to sign up to access it.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.080]   Although if you want to sign up for the newsletter,
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.420]   that could be valuable to you too.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.260]   Go to newsletter,
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.080]   scroll down to foundational fitness protocol.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.280]   It describes the program that I've been following
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.040]   essentially for 30 plus years.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.940]   And again, it's about three cardiovascular
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.000]   training sessions per week, three resistance training
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.160]   sessions per week.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.360]   The cardiovascular training ranges in time
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.020]   from about 12 minutes and then a longer 60 minute session.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:05.400]   The resistance training is generally 45 to 75 minutes.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.960]   So on average, about an hour.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.240]   And it might sound like a lot,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.040]   but when you look at that foundational fitness protocol,
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.560]   what you realize is that some of the workouts
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.440]   are really, really short.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.920]   Some of them are a little bit longer.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.720]   None of them are longer than an hour.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.220]   So it's pretty reasonable to do.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.760]   And I certainly did it while working well, to be frank,
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.260]   extremely long hours for many, many years.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.860]   So provided your sleep is intact
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.420]   and other areas of your life are dialed in with stress,
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.760]   et cetera, it should be doable for most everybody,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.460]   but modify it according to what you need.
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.260]   Or if you're doing something completely different,
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.180]   more power to you.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.940]   (upbeat music)
