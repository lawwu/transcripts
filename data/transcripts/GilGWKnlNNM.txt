[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Words to which I should like to call your attention this morning,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   and to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in chapter 6, verses 10 to 13.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Wherefore, take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   and having done all, to stand."
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Now, we've reached the point in our consideration of that statement,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   at which we are particularly interested in and concerned about the meaning of this expression,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   "the wiles of the devil".
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And I've been suggesting that we can look at that along two main lines.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   That, very clearly, in the New Testament, and in the subsequent history of the Christian Church,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   we are taught and are able to see that the devil has exercised these wiles of his
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   in a very general way, by producing states and conditions in the body of the Church, as it were,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   big movements within the Church, such as heretical movements,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   or definite examples of apostasy in certain sections of the Christian Church,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   or, as we have seen it also, in the fact of schism, wrong divisions in the Church.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And then we've been considering the whole teaching of the cults,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   these false religions, bodies, which set themselves up, as it were,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   alongside the Church, and would persuade many that they're truly Christian.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Well, now there we've been looking at the exercise of the wiles of the devil,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   in a very general way.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   But now we come to the more particular, to the more personal,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and to the more individual activities of the devil.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And here, of course, is something that is essential for our consideration.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's not only as essential as what we've been looking at,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   but in many ways, of course, is even more essential.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Because here is something that can happen to individuals in the Church,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   while the Church herself may be more or less healthy.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   You see, the subject is a very large one.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   There is almost no limit to the ways in which the devil,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   in his desire to spoil the work of God in Christ, attacks God's people.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   He'll try it on a big scale, he'll try it in very individual instances,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and he doesn't care how, as long as he brings any individual Christian,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   or any group of Christians, into a state of bondage and of unhappiness,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and thereby mars their testimony to the exceeding riches of his grace,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   in and through his dear Son.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Well, now, this subject of the wiles of the devil,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   as they're experienced by us as individual Christians,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   is one that has often been dealt with in literature.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Take, for instance, a famous book like John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   That is rarely the theme of that book.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   He pictures there how a man, first of all, is convicted of his sin,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   and escapes from the city of destruction,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and is in great trouble until his burden rolls away at the cross of Christ.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But his troubles are not ended then.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   The rest of the story is nothing really but a very graphic and wonderfully pictorial account
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   of the wiles of the devil.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And Bunyan wrote it in order that he might help struggling pilgrims
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   who are exposed to these wiles as they go through this journey called life.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   His holy war is a similar betreatise.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And likewise the whole obvious teaching in man's soul.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Now, all this was just Bunyan's way, and a very helpful way it is,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   this allegorical method of introducing people to the wiles of the devil
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   in order that being forewarned they should be forearmed.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You get the same thing in many other Puritan writings of 300 years ago.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   A famous book, for instance, by Richard Sibbes is called The Soul's Conflict.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Another one called The Bruiser's Breed.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Robert Bolton writes a book called Comforting Afflicted Consciences.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Now, most of the writings and the sermons of that great generation of preachers
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   was devoted to this subject of the wiles of the devil
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   as they are manifested in the lives of individual Christian believers.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And of course at this point one can say very accurately
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   that you get the same thing even in Roman Catholic literature.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Whatever their deficiencies, and we've been looking at them,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   they at any rate are quite clear about the devil and about his wiles.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And that is why they've always had large numbers of so-called manuals of diversion,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   the object and the intention of which has been to help Christian people
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   to deal with these various problems that arise.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And furthermore, their whole system of what is called casuistry is in many ways
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   also dealing, is something that deals with this particular problem.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Thus you see there has been in the past a very great and wealthy literature
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   dealing with this subject, showing in other words
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   how in practice in the subsequent history of the Christian church
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   what the apostle warns these Ephesians against at this point
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   has been a constantly recurring problem.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Now that leads me to make another remark as I introduce this subject.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   It has been a very striking fact about Christian life in this century,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and indeed since about 1880,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and I'm referring particularly to evangelical Christian life,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   it has been a very striking fact that there has been a curious absence of this kind of literature.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I wonder whether you've ever noticed that.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Can you think of any books that deal with the wiles of the devil
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   that have been written in the last 80 years or so?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Now why is that, you think?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   This which was so characteristic of the Puritan era,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   and these books which were used and read so much
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   by all who came under the powerful influence of the evangelical revival of the 18th century,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and who continued to read these books until about 1860 or 1880.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Suddenly all this stopped,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   and these books which had been reprinted constantly were no longer reprinted,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   they were not replaced by any others.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Nobody seemed to be concerned about this conflict against the principalities and powers,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   about how to stand against the wiles of the devil.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I'm calling your attention to it,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   because I think it is a very interesting commentary
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   on what has been happening during the last 80 years or so.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   There is only one explanation.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It is this.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   There has been a type of holiness teaching,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   a teaching on sanctification,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   which really has left no room for this at all.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It has at one point gone on repeating,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   claiming that that can solve all the problems.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And thus, you see, the whole of the Christian life has been reduced
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   to just surrender and abiding in Christ.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And this whole aspect has never been given any consideration whatsoever.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I just ask you again to consult the literature,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   look at the book lists,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   consider what you've heard yourselves.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   How often have you heard men preaching,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   and how often have you seen books which are given to this question
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   of the wiles of the devil and our wrestling,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   not against flesh and blood,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   but against the principalities and powers, etc.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It's a very interesting commentary,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   and it seems to me to be the main explanation,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   in many ways, of the present state of the Christian church.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   The superficial spirituality,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   it's the failure to realize the nature of the life,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   the conflict in which we are placed,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   and the absolute necessity to be clothed
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   with the power of the Lord himself and his might,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   and to put on piece by piece the whole armor of God.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Indeed, I cannot but recall something which came into the realm of my experience,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I think it was about 1941.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I remember a friend of mine telling me that his wife had been reading a most extraordinary book,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   which he regarded rarely as a joke.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Now, these were two very fine evangelical people, the husband and the wife.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   His wife, he said, had been reading a most amazing book,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   and it amused her very much.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   She thought it was quite fantastic and almost ridiculous.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   It happened to be Mr. C.S. Lewis's screw-tape letters.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Now, you see, here were evangelical people
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   who had become such strangers to the teaching about the vials of the devil,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   that when they read a book dealing with that very subject,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   they think it's almost a joke.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   They're amazed at this.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   This seems to them to be a caricature of the Christian life.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   They thought that Mr. C.S. Lewis had written it entirely to amuse and to entertain.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Now, there, you see, is a book which came in to deal with this very subject.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   He had undergone a certain experience himself
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   and was well-read, especially in allegorical literature, including Bunyan,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   and had seen the significance of this.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   I'm saying no more about Mr. C.S. Lewis than that,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   but at any rate, he had seen that this is a very vital and essential part
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   of the Christian's life while he's in this world.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   But we've become such strangers to it,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   that his book was regarded as a bit of entertainment and something which was even a joke.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Well, now then, that shows us the urgency of dealing with this whole matter.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Now, how do we approach this subject?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Well, it seems to me that first of all we must make a general approach to it,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   because it's very easy to see how the devil,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   with all his wilyness and all his subtlety,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   is able to attack us as believers along these lines.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   There are certain great watchwords in the New Testament
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   that seem to me to introduce this subject perfectly.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   You'll find them, these words, they come in the Gospels,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   you've got them everywhere right through the New Testament,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   and at once they should open our eyes to the whole character of this attack of the devil.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Here's the first, "Watch."
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   "Watch ye."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Our Lord used that word very frequently, "Watch."
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   You'll find the apostles using it.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   The apostle Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, says,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   "Watch ye, which you like men, be strong, be steadfast in the faith, watch and pray."
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   This great word comes, I say, everywhere in the New Testament,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   and at once it suggests that there is a very subtle enemy.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Any army engaged in warfare always has to put its sentries in position.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   It always has its watchmen.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   You never know what the enemy is going to do.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   You mustn't assume that because it's night that he's going to do nothing.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   He may take advantage of the cover of the darkness.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   So you post your men and they march backwards,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   and you're watching in all directions, day and night, without intermission.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And therefore, you see, the failure on our part to watch, to be aware of this,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   gives the devil a wonderful opening to come in.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And there can be no question at all that there are many people who are defeated by the wilds of the devil
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   simply because they never think about the devil.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   They don't watch.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   They say, "I've been saved. It's all right. I'm in Christ. I'm resting on Him.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   There's no need to watch. It's all right. He's looking after me.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   All I do is to keep my eye on Him."
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   They're not watching for the enemy.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   They're not being wary about the wilds of the devil.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   They don't realize that this is a great warfare.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   No, no, it's a question of resting.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It's all right. Every problem's solved. There's nothing more to do.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   And the result is, of course, that failing to heed the constantly repeated New Testament exhortation to watch,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   they are caught and they are defeated.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   What's the other? Well, the other, of course, is the Word itself.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   The Apostle Paul, for instance, is very careful to tell a man like Timothy,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   who was such an easy prey to the devil in certain respects,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   to pay attention to reading,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   not to forget the Scriptures which can make us wise unto salvation.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   The constant exhortation to be reading the Scriptures.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And, of course, every one of these New Testament epistles was written
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   because of this very conflict and in order to help people to meet the wilds of the devil.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   So, if we neglect the reading of the Word,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   we shall certainly be defeated by Him.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   It's a way, the best way of all, perhaps, to watch.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Here, you're given teaching which tells you about the various ways in which He can come.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Here, you have an authoritative account of His machinations and His wilds and all His subtleties.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Very well, the more you know about it, the more easily and quickly you'll be able to detect Him at His first move
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   and thereby to stand against Him.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   So, the reading of the Word is absolutely essential.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   And Christian people who do not give diligence to the reading of the Word
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   are always those who are trapped by the wilds of the devil.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   It's here you learn about the heresies that we've been considering
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   and the causes of schism and all these other things which the devil does on a big scale.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   But in the same way, we are given this detailed instruction
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   of what he does to us one by one in this still more personal manner.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   We are told here to prove all things, not to believe every spirit, but to try the spirits.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   How do you do that?
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   You'll never be able to do that if you don't know this Word and its teaching.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   So, you see, by encouraging us not to read the Word of God,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   the devil comes in in all his wildness, incidentally.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   It's a very interesting point to notice about that book, The Screwtip Letters, by Mr. C.S. Lewis.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   He doesn't deal with this question of not reading the Word,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   which I think is a very significant point, showing the defect in his teaching.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   This chief of the evil spirits doesn't give any instruction to his underlings
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   to prevent the believers from reading this.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   But this is the main weapon, as we shall see later.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Well, very well, there's a second thing.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Then the next thing, of course, is pray.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   "Watch and pray, lest ye fall into temptation," says our Lord.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Again, he says that men should always pray and not faint.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   If you don't pray, you will faint.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   The Apostle Paul says, "Pray without ceasing."
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Never stop praying. Always be praying.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   He says it's the only way in which you can keep going.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Well, now, we'll find it here also,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   when we come to the end of this particular section that we're considering.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Always, he says, in all things with prayer,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   "watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplications for the saints,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit."
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Well, again, I needn't emphasize this, neither.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   It's obvious if the New Testament tells us that we must pray to this extent,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   that to neglect prayer exposes us immediately to all the wilds and the subtleties of the devil.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Our Lord himself spent much of his time in prayer.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   What for? Well, to fortify himself, to have communion with God,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   and to be given light and instruction, and to be blessed in his own spirit.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And so we get this constant injunction and exhortation to be instant in prayer,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   out of season, in season.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   All this is to go on, always, and the neglect of it at once exposes us to the wilds of the devil.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And the last thing I would mention is self-examination.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   "Examine your own selves," says the apostle.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   "Prove your own selves, whether ye be in the faith or not."
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Now, he writes that, you see, to believers.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   But that's gone out of practice, hasn't it?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   We don't believe in self-examination any longer.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   We say, "You mustn't look at yourself. Look to the Lord."
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   If you look at yourself, you make yourself miserable.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Look to the Lord. Always be looking out.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   And as we shall see as we go along, the neglect of self-examination
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   is probably one of the greatest causes of defeat in the Christian life.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Now, the point I'm making is this, that the devil, therefore,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   obviously will attack us along these particular lines.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   If he can discourage our watching, all is going to be well from his standpoint.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   If he causes us to neglect the reading of the Word, and the study of the Word,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   and the understanding of the Word, it'll suit him admirably.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   If he causes us to neglect praying, well, we shall faint.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And in that condition, we're very easy and obvious prey to him.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Self-examination.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Everything all right, like the people in the church of Laodicea.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Doing well. Rich. Everything wonderful.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Church never doing so well.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   But actually, poor and wretched and blind.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   They hadn't examined themselves.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   They didn't know that they were blind.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   They didn't realize they were naked.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   There is nothing more terrible than the neglect of self-examination.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   So, the devil, in his wilds, comes to us and does his utmost
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   to discourage us at every one of these special points.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   And it's a question we should therefore ask ourselves this morning.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   How do we emerge in the light of this examination?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Are we watching? Watching unto prayer?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Are we diligent in our reading of the Bible?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Are we examining ourselves?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Do we ever take a kind of spiritual stocktaking to discover where we are?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Any teaching or any view that we may hold that it discourages any one of these things,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   or a superficial performance of any one of these things,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   is a manifestation of the wilds of the devil.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   If you really think that just to read a few verses
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   and a short comment on it in a matter of five minutes
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   and a brief word of prayer is adequate for you a day,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   well, then I say, you don't know anything about the wilds of the devil.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   That is not the exhortation of the New Testament.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   That has not been the practice of the saints throughout the centuries.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   But a superficial spirituality imagines that that's enough.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Read my portion, had my prayers, I'm all right.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Just go on.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   And not aware of any stagnation in the soul,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   not aware of a lack of growth,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   not aware of an appalling superficiality,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   this is nothing but a very wonderful manifestation
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   of the wilds of the devil. He's come as an angel of light.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And he says, "Oh, that's enough, just a little. Other people don't read at all.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   You are really very good. There are many nominal Christians who never read the Scriptures at all.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Ah, you are a Scripture reader. Very well, you are all right.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And because you've read just a few verses, you've read your Scriptures.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   And you know the Word of God.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   I'm not surprised that there's a campaign against superficial Bible reading.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   It's needed very badly.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Anything that encourages a superficial performance of any one of these things
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   is always a manifestation of the wilds of the devil.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   But now let me move on, and having looked at it in a very general way,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   I'm just giving a general introduction this morning.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Let us consider something of the roots of attack,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   the roots along which he attacks.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   You see, this is a matter of strategy, isn't it?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   There's nothing more important in a war than to consider the roots of attack.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   That's why we very nearly lost the last war.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   The French, you see, stopped their Maginot Line at Sedan
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   and neglected from there, along the Belgian border, right to the sea.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Not realizing that the Germans had always come through the other route
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   and would always do so.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   But if you neglect a study of the roots of attack,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   well, it's very obvious, isn't it, that you're likely to be defeated.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And the devil has got certain roots, which he follows very regularly.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Clever though he is, he lacks originality in this respect.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And of course, the roots are obvious.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   And the roots, the three main roots are these.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   First of all, the mind.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   That's the chief root, because in many ways it's the most important one.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   If he can get us wrong there, well, we're going to be wrong everywhere else,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   because the highest thing in men is his mind.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And that is why the devil makes this particular attack upon the mind.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   And then, of course, he comes along the line of experience.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   There's another great realm of our life in this world, the realm of experience.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Where we are not so much concerned about intellectual understanding
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   and formulation of truth,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   but the more experiential aspect.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And a great deal of our lives is lived in the realm of experience.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Feelings, sensations, sensibilities, desires, and all these things.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Moods, states.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   How much of our life is governed by this whole realm of experience.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   There's something more elemental about this, even than the mind.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And a man should always be struggling to attain a mastery of this aspect
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   by the mind and the understanding.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   And it's our failure to do that, as we shall be seeing,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   that accounts for so many of our troubles.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   So the devil attacks us along the line of the experience.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And the third is, of course, the practice.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Our behavior, our conduct.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   The things we do and the things that we don't do.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   You see, there is a man's life, in a sense, isn't it?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   His outlook, his thought, his rationalizing.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And then this realm of experience, and then what we actually do in practice,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   very largely as the result of the other two.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Well now, it's of vital importance for us to realize
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   that the devil attacks us along the three lines.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   He doesn't confine himself to one.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   He'll attack us anywhere.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   That's the great principle we've got to get hold of.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   We must not assume that he's always going to come in the same way.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   If you are only preparing in that way, he'll suddenly come this way.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   If you, as it were, are guarding your front door only, he'll come in at the back door.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   If you think you've got rid of him through the windows in the front,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   he'll be in through the windows at the back, from every conceivable direction.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   It's not surprising that the apostle says we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   but against principalities, not one, but many, myriads of them.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Against powers, almost an endless number.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Against the rulers of the darkness of this world.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   That is why I was at such pains to give you a description
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   of what the Bible tells us about the character of this enemy.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   The number of emissaries, the agencies, the forms, the guises, the different appearances.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   They almost baffle description.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   And they can come at any point and in any way.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   But there are the three main roots, which can be subdivided almost endlessly.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I'm not going to do that. We haven't got the time.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   But I am trying to deal with the big and the broad principles.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Well now, having seen that there are three main lines of attack,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   it is very interesting to observe how he uses these three main lines of attack.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   And again, there is a broad classification.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   The first is that he produces a lack of balance between these three aspects of our life.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And the other is that taking them individually,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   he makes us give either too much or too little attention to each one of them.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Now there, it seems to me, are the big principles which we should hold in our minds.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Here are the roots, the mind, the experience and the practice.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Now what does he do? Well, looking at it very broadly, here is your main classification.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   His first object is to get a lack of balance in the three.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Then the second is, taking them one by one,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   he will either make us do too much in this respect or too little.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   It's amazing to me on reflection and meditation.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   And I've been spending much time over this recently.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   How you will find that that is almost invariably what he does.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Of course, he varies the mechanism.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   The devil's mechanism and mode of attack is very similar to some of these locks that you can buy
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   to save your car from theft or robbery or something like that.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   They tell you, "Now here you've got a possible three thousand combinations.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   This thing can be put into such a way that there are three thousand possible combinations.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   And it's going to be a very great accident if the robber will know the exact combination that you're using."
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Well now, I'm using that as an illustration to show you
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   that while there is one principle as it were, the variations within that can be almost endless.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   But those are the two big divisions.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And I want us to touch on the first this morning.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   The wiles of the devil as they're displayed in producing a lack of balance in the Christian life
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   as between the mind and the experience and the practice.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Now there is no more frequent or fruitful manifestation of the wiles of the devil than just this.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Indeed in dealing with the heresies and the apostasy and the schism and the cults,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   we've seen very clearly that that is ultimately how the devil produces every one of those.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   It is ultimately due to some one-sided emphasis somewhere or another.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   You see the cults thrive on the desire for experience.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   That's where they come in.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   And as we saw many of the schisms have been due to a lack of balance in the matter of the mind and of the intellect.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Well, there it is.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   So the devil pays particular attention to this aspect.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   His desire is, I say, to produce an imbalance.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Oh, this question of balance is in many ways the most important of all in the Christian life.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   It's important in every realm of life.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Even physically it's important.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   The right amount of time and attention you give to your mind and to your body.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   You neglect your body and eventually your mind won't function so well.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Balance, the mind and the body, mind of a matter as we put it.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   How important balance is.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Take the question of diet.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   It's a great theme today, balanced diet.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Not too much of any one ingredient.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Get the right proportions.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   If you want to be really healthy, you've got to get a balanced diet.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And so on.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   It's the same everywhere.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Whether you're defending your country, how much to put into your army, how much into your navy, how much into your air force.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And it's constantly changing.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   But you've always got to have your balance so that the country can act and behave as a whole.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Now it's exactly like that in the Christian life.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And the devil knows that.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And the simplest thing in the world for him is to just get us to be a bit imbalanced.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   To lack this balance.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   The Christian life, if you like, can be considered as a three-legged stool.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   And they've got to be the right size if you're to get your balance and to go on comfortably.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Now let me explain what I mean.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   There are some, you see, who are persuaded to give exclusive attention to the mind and to the knowledge only.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   These are the people who are out for ideas.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   They're intellectualists.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Nothing matters to them but knowledge.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And they spend their time in reading and in studying and in garnering a great amount of knowledge.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   They're not interested in feelings.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   "Any fool can feel," they say.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   "Any fool can have emotions and be emotional."
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   No, no, they're men of mind and of knowledge and of understanding.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   And they discount the experimental side.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   That's almost trivial.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And in practice, well, of course, they wouldn't deny that practice is important,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   but they're too busy reading to be very concerned about practice.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   In other words, the devil has wrought havoc in the Church in general,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   as well as in individuals so often throughout the centuries,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   by producing a kind of scholasticism.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   You know, it's interesting to draw graphs of the history of the Church.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   You get a great revival, outpouring of the Spirit of God,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   great light and understanding, marvellous experience, practice following.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   And then perhaps certain excesses tend to come in,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   so people very rightly begin to say, "Well, now we must have teaching,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   we must control this, we must have the mind enlightened."
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   So they put great emphasis upon teaching.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   And you know, in less than a hundred years,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   you will find that you've got as dry as dust and an utterly dead orthodox scholasticism,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   spending the whole of the time in dotting the i's, crossing the t's.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   A perfect system, all intimate, all mind.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   The great living doctrine has been hardened into a kind of sterile scholasticism,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   which is useless and valueless.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Boasting about its orthodoxy, but dead.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Not ever seeing any conversions,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   never seeing people really being built up and moved by the truth.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Purely a matter of the mind.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Now, this is a very real danger, and it's a danger to us one by one.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   There are many people whose view of Christianity is purely intellectual.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   It was Lord Melbourne, I believe, Queen Victoria's first Prime Minister,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   who said on one occasion, he said, "Things are coming to a very pretty pass
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   if religion's going to stop being personal."
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Now that's a typical attitude, isn't it?
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Religion? Personal? Nonsense.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Going to church is a part of the social round.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   You don't become personal about these things.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   It's a right thing, of course, to go and worship God,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   but you mustn't become personal about this.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   And of course, the same thing happened in the 18th century.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   The great charge that was brought against Whitefield and the Westleys and others was
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   this charge of enthusiasm, fanaticism.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   "These people get excited about their religion," they said.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   "They're manifesting feeling."
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   "Well, here they are," they said. "This isn't Christianity.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Christianity is the most dignified thing in the world,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   the most orderly thing in the world. You mustn't do things like that."
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   "It's something grand and noble and magnificent.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Decorum is of the very essence of it."
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   "And these people are getting excited about their religion.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   This is sheer enthusiasm."
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   And so they tried to stop the preaching of those men of God who were filled with the Spirit.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Now, that can happen to every one of us,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   and it does tend to happen to some of us, particularly at this point.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   You see, we're all intellect, kind of spiritual tadpoles, all head,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   and no real body, and none of this symmetry which I'm trying to describe to you.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Now, that's one danger.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   The other danger, the next danger, of course, is that people put the whole emphasis upon experience.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   They're interested only in emotions and in feelings.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Now, they say, "Look at those people.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   They seem to have a head full of knowledge, but they're useless. Look at them."
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   They never seem to feel anything at all.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   They're talking about these great things, but they're talking about them as if they were talking about geometry.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   They're not moving. It's a system, utterly mechanical.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Why, they say, "Why don't they shout out sometimes?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Why don't they let themselves go? Why don't they feel something?"
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   And, you see, these people think that a meeting is of no value at all
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   unless there's been a great deal of shouting and exclamation,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   and a kind of riot of the emotions.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Now, you see where the subtlety of the devil comes in.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Emotion is a vital part of Christian faith, but emotionalism is not.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And so it reacts, you see, always.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   The first people are so afraid of emotionalism that they crush emotion altogether.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And the third people tend to do the same thing.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   But these people, this second group, they think of it all solely in terms of what they feel,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   sensations and sensibility.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   They're not interested in exposition.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   They don't want understanding.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   They want to feel something and have a thrill.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Then it's wonderful.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   They look for feelings only, and they judge everything solely by this standard,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   this measure of feeling and sensibility and emotion.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And alas, that kind of tendency is often ministered unto.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Things are done deliberately to work them up.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Singing, hand-clapping, shouting, affecting illustrations,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   moving on the emotions, direct pressure on the emotions, all that.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I think that's the devil coming in, just to get these people to lose their balance.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   And how often does it happen?
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   We are all liable to this, some of us more than others.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And then the third line is the realm of practice.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Here are the practical people.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   They're not interested in this theology and doctrine.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   They're very suspicious of these emotional people.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   They're hard-headed men.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   They say what's needed is to do something.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   With the world as it is, what are you doing about it?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   All right, you have your theories if you like, but I'm concerned to do something,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   to put things right.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And so they give the whole of their emphasis to practice, to conduct, behavior, morality.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   No, no, they have no time for all this reading and studying and doctrine and so on.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And these are the people who get so excited.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   No, no, the man who really matters in life is a man who really gets things done.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   A man of his word, an honest man, a good man, a moral man, a man who does good,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   especially with the world as it is today.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   What's the point of preaching about all these high doctrines
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   with all these problems teeming round and about us?
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   The statesmen failing us, the clash of nations and within nations.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   And here you are talking about these great high doctrines and about fear.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Why don't you do something?
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   And here they are doing things and thinking that that is the whole of Christianity.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Well, no, then, there you see the ways in which the devil, by his wiles, comes in and upsets the balance.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Why is all this wrong?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Why is every one of those wrong?
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Because that is the truth. Every one of them is wrong.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   If you put all your emphasis on the mind, you're wrong.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   If you put it all on experience, you're wrong.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   If you put it all into practice, you're wrong.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Why? Well, for these reasons.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   That is entirely lacking in the balance that we always find in the Scriptures.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   The Scriptures are always characterized by balance.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   How often have I said this?
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Make an analysis of any one you like of the New Testament epistles.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   What do you find? You find this.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   A kind of preliminary salutation, affection, experience, emotion.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Then a great display of doctrine, reminding them of the truth.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   And then, therefore, application, practice.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Every time, invariable.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   There is not a single book in the Bible but that it's characterized by this very balance.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   It's everywhere.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   It is the great characteristic of the biblical teaching.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Every side and aspect and part of men is catered for.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Book of Revelation, as well as others, it's there, it's everywhere.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   So that if we are lacking in this balance, we are unlike the Scripture.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   We are not conforming to the pattern.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   But another serious defect about this lack of balance is this.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   It shows that the person concerned has completely failed to see the inevitable relationship between the three.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   He is wrong about the three.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   How do you prove that, says someone? Well, I do it very simply like this.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   If you've got the true view of the truth, well, then I say you must feel it.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   If you don't, you haven't got the true view.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Look at it like this.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Do you really believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   and that he gave his body to be broken and his blood to be shed, that you might be forgiven?
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   You say you believe that.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   You believe in the substitutionary view of the atonement, that the Son of God loved you to that extent.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   All right.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   If you tell me that you felt nothing, I say that you haven't believed it.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   You haven't seen it.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   For love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died, what happens to me?
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Do I sit in my calm intellectualism? Not a bit of it.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   My richest gain I count but loss, and poor contempt on all my pride, intellectual as well as other.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   If you've really seen this truth, you are moved to the depth of your being.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And not only that, you're going to do something about it.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   If you believe that he died like that in order to save you from sin, can you go on sinning?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   You see, it's not logical apart from anything else.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   So that there is no value in saying that you see this great truth,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   if your feelings are not engaged and you're not moved emotionally,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   and if you're not moved to action,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   it's a complete failure to see the inevitable relationship between the three.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   But still more serious, it implies a failure to submit ourselves to God's way of dealing with men and delivering it.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   What is God's way? Well, God's way is to deal with the whole man.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   And that's why Christianity differs from the cults.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   I was showing you that last Sunday.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   The cults never deal with the whole man, they only deal with parts of us.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Everything false only deals with a part.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   The glory of this and the way in which you can test yourself as to whether you believe the true gospel or not is this.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Is the whole of you taken up? Is the whole man involved?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   If not, there's something wrong. The devil has got you with his wiles.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   So that if a man comes to me and says, "I'm not interested in my feelings."
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   All I say to him is this, "Very well then, what you think is your salvation is yours, it isn't God's.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   God is as anxious to save your feelings as he is to save your mind."
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   If a man says, "I really can't be bothered about what I do in practice."
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   I say the same thing to him.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   "Our old man was crucified with him," says Paul in Romans 6.6.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   What for? "That the body of sin might be destroyed, that we might no longer serve sin."
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   If on the other end a man comes to me and says, "You know, I'm not interested at all in theology, doctrine,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   all this time you're taking, working through, I'm not a bit interested."
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   "All right, my friend, you may not be, but all I've got to say to you is this,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   that what you are dismissing and despising and rejecting is what God has provided for you.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   You have no right to say that you are not interested in the mind. God has given you a mind.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   And if you are not using your mind and disciplining yourself to study the Scripture
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   and to read everything you can that will help you to read the Scripture,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   you are refusing and spurning God's own gift.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   You're insulting him. It's his way of salvation to save the whole man and not simply parts of man.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   We have no right to pick and choose.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   God's way of salvation in Christ takes up the intellect, the heart emotions, the will,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   the understanding, the sensibilities, the experience, the practice, everything,
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   the whole man, even the body eventually.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   If you and I pick and choose, we are insulting God and throwing back into his face
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   one of his gifts or one aspect or another of his great salvation.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   And finally, this means, of course, that we are bringing the gospel
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   in the name of God himself somehow or another into disrepute.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   You see, this is God's purpose, that he shall have these new men made in the image of Christ,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   having the balance that he had between the mind and the experience and the practice.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   We are meant to be like him, to conform to his image.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   And if we don't, if we are lopsided or imbalanced or truncated Christians,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   I say we are bringing God's work in Christ into disrepute.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   We are failing to glorify him as we ought.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   To glorify him, says the apostle Paul, with your mind and with your body,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   whatsoever you do in word or deed, do all things to the glory of God,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   whether it is the eating or drinking or anything, everything to the glory of God,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   the whole man, the entire personality.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And if we fail to do that, we are not only succumbing to the vials of the devil,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   we are detracting from the glory of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Oh, there is nothing more marvellous, I say, about this salvation than its perfect balance.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   The Christian is a man who knows in whom he has believed.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   He is able to give a reason for the hope that is in him.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   He rejoices in the truth.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   He rejoices in the Lord Jesus Christ with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   And he is doing his utmost to be holy, because God is holy.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   He has got a vision of the everlasting glory ahead of him,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   and he that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Can't you see why it must of necessity be one of the main objects and objectives of the devil
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   to upset this balance and to make us all this or all that or all the other?
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   No, no, it's to be all together, ever, only, always, for thee. Amen.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   The closing hymn is hymn number 438, 438.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   O thou who camest from above, the pure celestial fire to impart,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   kindle a flame of sacred love on the mean altar of my heart. 438.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   [organ music]
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   O thou who created man, the pure celestial fire with love,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   kindle a flame of sacred love on the mean altar of my heart.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
