[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.560]   Today on the podcast, we're going to talk about the skills of
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.200]   wealth, and I've got great news.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.720]   It's a brand new year, maybe a brand new day, depending on when you're listening
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.320]   to this, but it's certainly a new year and a new month.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.840]   And here's the cool thing about a new year, a new month, or a new day.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.960]   A new day is a time for a fresh start.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.320]   And today you can reflect back on your progress toward your goals over the last
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.400]   months and perhaps even a year and consider your progress.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.360]   And you might have two emotions that come out of that.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.000]   You might be able to look back and reflect on 2015 with satisfaction.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.360]   Satisfaction about how much excellent progress you've made towards your goals.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.080]   Or you might look back with a little bit of regret, feeling like,
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.400]   "I wish I'd done a little better."
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.760]   Well, either one of those is okay.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.880]   But today I want to speak with a special message to those of you who look back
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.760]   with a little bit of regret, because here's the good news.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.320]   It's a brand new day.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.600]   And today you can begin to develop, practice, and perfect the skills that you
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.960]   need that will help you build wealth in every area of your life.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:47.080]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.720]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.480]   Thank you so much for being with me here today, Radicals.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.880]   It's a brand new year.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.400]   I am rested, rejuvenated, re-energized, and ready.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.840]   I needed one more R.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.320]   And ready to go for a brand new year on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.080]   And today we talk about skills, one of my favorite topics.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:19.720]   I hope that you've had an excellent holiday season.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.040]   I hope that you've enjoyed perhaps a little bit of time off.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.200]   I hope that you've enjoyed some time with those that you love.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.640]   But I'm excited to get back to work personally.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.040]   I had a great time with my family, did a little bit of camping, visited various
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.720]   family members, did a little bit of travel, got some things cleaned up.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.320]   And today, Monday, January 4, 2016, I am ready to get back to work.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.800]   It's going to be a big year for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.320]   I'm very excited about the opportunities that are in front of me.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   And I'm excited about the hard work that's in front of me.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.600]   But as I was reflecting over the last couple of weeks on 2015 and kind of
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.720]   checking in on my plans for 2016, I was thinking about the progress that I've
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.200]   made and the progress that I haven't made.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.120]   Now, in many ways, 2015 was an excellent year for me, but it was also a very
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.160]   challenging year for me.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.760]   And frankly, I didn't make quite as much progress as I thought I would, as I wanted
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.880]   to. I went back and listened to the show that I created at the beginning of 2015.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.720]   And in looking at all the things I set out to do, I didn't accomplish all the
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.680]   things I wanted to do.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.840]   Now, for me, that's normal.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.200]   And I've learned that that's normal.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.040]   I've learned not to beat myself up too much about those things.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.160]   Some people struggle with thinking big.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.320]   I don't struggle to think big.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.560]   Usually I think far bigger than I can ever achieve.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.480]   And I've just learned that generally I set out bigger plans than I can execute on.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.840]   And for me, it's OK.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.320]   I'm aware of that.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.560]   And I've learned how to mitigate the downsides of that character trait.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.920]   But in thinking about it, I was reflecting on this next year.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.200]   And in considering my own personal progress, I found solace in the concept of skill
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.400]   development. And that's what I want to focus today's show on, to share with you some
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.440]   ideas that I have about skills and how useful a concept this is for people who are
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.040]   working toward their goals.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.480]   I am amazed about the world that we live in, and especially as it relates to wealth.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:24.560]   And one of the most amazing concepts to me that I love is the fact that anybody in our
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.480]   modern economic system where we all live today, all of you who are listening to the
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.520]   sound of my voice, whatever country you're in, anybody can build wealth.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.560]   If you have the knowledge that you need and the skills that you need, and if you have
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.880]   enough time for that knowledge and those skills to be applied to the point where they
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.280]   work, anybody can do it.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.760]   To me, that's a very freeing, freeing idea, because we don't live in a time where you
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.040]   have to be born into wealth.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.680]   We don't live in a time that you have to somehow do something nefarious to gain
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.440]   wealth. We don't live in a time where you have to get lucky, be chosen from the genetic
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.960]   lottery. We live in a time where any man and any woman with a good plan, learning the
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.640]   knowledge that they need and acquiring the education and the wisdom which comes with
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.400]   applied knowledge and education over time, and then developing the skills, really any
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   man and any woman can build wealth.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.680]   Now, the level of wealth is not guaranteed.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.120]   Who knows if you're going to become a millionaire or a billionaire?
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.160]   A huge difference between those two things.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.960]   But you can build wealth.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.920]   Now, I love the word skill because skills are learnable.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.720]   And a fundamental tenet of wealth building and a fundamental tenet of personal
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.080]   development is that anything that somebody else has learned, you can learn too.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.320]   Which means for me, when I think about all of the challenges that I face and all of the
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.760]   areas where I fall short and all of the places where my character still needs to be
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.280]   honed, I take encouragement from the fact that other people with the same problems and
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.840]   shortcomings that I have, have faced those challenges and have learned new skills that
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.560]   have enabled them and equipped them to be able to work through them, through the
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:25.480]   challenges. So regardless of how good or how bad my results have been, I need to
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.440]   continue to focus on the skills.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.200]   You have a good plan, have the knowledge that I need, and then work on developing and
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.640]   perfecting the skills that ultimately will lead to wealth.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.960]   Because here's a cool thing, at least how I see it.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.920]   People who are wealthy or at least people who are wealthy from their own actions.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.240]   We'll talk briefly in a moment about those who are wealthy from the actions of others.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.080]   But people who are wealthy have done one of two things.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:00.000]   Either they've unconsciously learned the knowledge and applied the skills of wealth to
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.680]   their situation, or they have self-consciously learned the knowledge and applied the
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.560]   skills of wealth to their situation.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:16.560]   Either way, the results that they're achieving or have achieved are based upon the
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.240]   application of knowledge and skill.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.600]   Now, what about those who come into wealth by the actions of someone else, win a
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.120]   lottery, gain an inheritance?
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.280]   Well, give it a little bit of time and what you'll see is that those people who are
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.360]   wealthy and stay wealthy in those situations, those who are actually able to stay
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.760]   wealthy, only are able to stay wealthy because either they've unconsciously learned
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.640]   the knowledge and applied the skills of wealth, or they've self-consciously learned
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.560]   the knowledge and applied the skills of wealth.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:53.360]   Now, I don't know how to do things unconsciously, but I do know how to do
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:02.760]   things self-consciously. As a sentient being, I can chart the course, pick the goal,
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.800]   develop the plan, build the skill, and in the fullness of time, I'll get the results
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.120]   that I'm looking for.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.200]   And the same applies to you.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.760]   So in today's show, I want to just give you some ideas about how to apply these skill
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.080]   sets to your life and some ideas on specific types of skills that you should be
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.280]   looking at to apply.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.520]   Before I get to the meat of the skills that I want to talk about in just a moment, I
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.720]   want to talk briefly about sponsors for today.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.040]   Sponsor of the day number one is the YNAB budgeting software.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.800]   You need a budget. Budgeting is a fundamental and core skill of wealth.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   There are many ways to budget.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.000]   I've done recent shows on budgeting.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.400]   Feel free to check those out if you're interested.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.280]   But budgeting is a core skill.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.160]   You will not become and stay wealthy without a good system of budgeting.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.720]   If you've got a system that works for you, great.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.560]   If you don't, I would commend to you that this is a major area that you can make
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.680]   progress in in a brand new year.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.560]   And I would recommend that you try the YNAB budgeting software.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.960]   YNAB is short for You Need a Budget.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.720]   It's an acronym.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.800]   And YNAB is the number one most requested, most suggested advertiser on the show.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.320]   More audience members of Radical Personal Finance use and love YNAB than any of our
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.920]   other advertisers or frankly, any other product that I'm aware of at the moment.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.400]   YNAB solves the major problems of budgeting brilliantly.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.600]   I'd recommend you go back and listen to episode 246.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.200]   That's an interview with Jesse Mecham.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.160]   I love YNAB.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.560]   I use YNAB every day.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.640]   If you'd like to check it out and see what it's all about, you need to do two
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:40.960]   things.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.200]   Number one, sign up for a free 30-day trial of the software.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.160]   It's a free, full-featured trial of the software.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.200]   Sign up for that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.960]   Please use that tracking link so I get credit for your download.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.600]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.800]   Do that, number one.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.760]   And number two, work your way through the excellent training materials that YNAB
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.320]   offers.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.120]   They have all kinds of free webinars and classes about how to use the software and
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.560]   build your budget properly.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.120]   This is the perfect time of year to do it.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.560]   So check out radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.440]   Sponsor of the day number two today is Paladin Registry.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.920]   And this is my solution to the most requested problem or question that I've
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.400]   gotten on the show, which is, "Joshua, how do I find a great financial advisor?"
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.080]   Paladin Registry is a registry service of financial advisors.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.520]   It's a vetting service, a screening process.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.120]   The founder of Paladin Registry is a man named Jack Wehmeyer.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.160]   He and his team have put together an extensive series of screens to help weed
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.440]   out some of the bad and incompetent financial advisors that are out there.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.280]   Who have a license to their name.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.120]   And so the way it works is if you would like to interview some prospective
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.360]   financial advisors to see if they might be able to serve you in the care and
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.160]   stewardship of your wealth, you go to this link radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.560]   P-A-L-A-D-I-N.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.920]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.920]   Use that link.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.280]   Go through that link, put in your name, your email address, your phone number.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.040]   It'll ask you for your zip code.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.080]   I can't remember if it asks you for your mailing address.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.280]   And it'll ask you for the amount of assets that you have that are potentially
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.960]   available for the advisor to manage.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.560]   It's important that you fill that in properly so that they can match you with
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.640]   an advisor who works with clients similar to you.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.320]   And then they'll put you in contact with sometimes two, sometimes three
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.440]   advisors, sometimes more.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.440]   You have an opportunity to check with those advisors, see if they
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.480]   might be a good fit for you.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.800]   It's a great time to do that here at the New Year.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.440]   The good financial advisor is worth their money.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.280]   A bad financial advisor isn't worth any money, but a good financial
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.320]   advisor is worth their money.

[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.000]   A majority of the listeners of Radical Personal Finance are based
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.080]   in the United States.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.000]   And there's something very unique about the United States of America.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.400]   It can be measured based upon wealth.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.320]   The United States is an incredibly wealthy country, and there are many
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.840]   reasons for that.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.200]   Some reasons are geographical.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.080]   If you look at a globe and look at the different aspects of just global
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.280]   geography, you can see some of the major influences that have led to the
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.680]   United States being as wealthy as we are.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.040]   But some major reasons are also cultural, and those cultural
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.120]   reasons are very important.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.760]   One of the very important aspects of the U.S.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.280]   culture is a deep-seated belief in the idea of cause and effect.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.000]   Now, that's a worldview perspective.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.160]   It comes from the Judeo-Christian heritage of the United States culture.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.520]   Scripture says, "Don't be deceived.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.400]   God is not mocked.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.720]   Whatever a man sows, that also shall he reap."
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.040]   And that idea of cause and effect goes very deeply in U.S.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.160]   American society.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:57.200]   It's a reason why people had the expectation that if I put in hard work,
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:03.520]   if I put in effort, if I plant good seed, I can expect to reap a good harvest.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.680]   That's not true in many other places of the world, or at least people don't have
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.200]   that perception of it being true because of the external influences, whether it's
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.120]   corrupt government or an unjust system of confiscation or whatever the cultural
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.160]   influences may be.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:27.520]   But that cause and effect principle has a tremendous bearing on what we do.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:34.760]   And so if we want to create the effects of wealth, we've got to study the causes
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:41.360]   of wealth, and those causes are knowledge, knowing the right things to do, having
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.800]   knowledge about the areas that are important, and then applying that
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.440]   knowledge systematically over time and applying the skills that will ultimately
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.280]   lead to wealth.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.480]   And those skills are going to fall into the same basic five-part framework that
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.040]   we talk about, except it's primarily going to be about the first three.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.320]   We have to apply the skills of increasing income.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.280]   We have to apply the skills of decreasing expenses.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.760]   We have to apply the skills of investing wisely.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.440]   Skill is applicable to avoiding catastrophe and optimizing lifestyle, but
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.760]   it's less direct.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.280]   And today we're going to focus heavily on wealth.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:23.760]   So in order for you to build wealth in this next year, you've got to gain and
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.320]   assimilate knowledge in the areas that matter to your life and to your goals.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.800]   And then you've got to learn, develop, and perfect those skills that lead to wealth.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.680]   Knowledge is the important first step.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.320]   If you're having a problem or you're seeking a certain result in your life,
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.040]   then the first thing you should do is seek out the information and the education
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.000]   and the knowledge and the ideas that are pertinent to that problem.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.280]   Frankly, I'm astounded at people who don't do this, and the majority of people
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.280]   don't do this.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.040]   The majority of people who have problems in their lives just simply want to complain
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.000]   about those problems and gripe about those problems.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.560]   And it somehow doesn't seem to occur to many people to actually think about how
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.800]   to solve those problems.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:10.000]   Now, there is a subset of the culture for whom this is unthinkable, and that subset
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.040]   is me and many of you who are listening.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.520]   We can't even conceive of why would you not work on your problems, but yet the
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:23.200]   majority of people don't seem to even take the first steps of working on their
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:23.520]   problems.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.840]   They don't seem to even take the first steps of going out and searching for the
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.680]   knowledge and the ideas that they need.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.880]   So knowledge is the basis.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.360]   If you've got problems, just start by asking around and talking about the
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.520]   problems that you're facing, and you'll start bumping into answers.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:48.440]   One of the core principles of the personal development and success ideas is the idea
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.920]   of focus and intention.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.360]   And when people talk about the importance of setting goals or talking about problems
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.320]   when I talk about journaling or things like that, what those things do is they
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.600]   bring the problems, they bring the decisions, they bring the situations you're
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   facing from the back of your mind to the front of your mind and make you aware.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.040]   And then when you're aware of things, your brain starts to filter the results that
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.640]   are in your environment around you.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.040]   This is what, I mean, this is the basis of the famed law of attraction.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.720]   It's not a matter of attraction.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.280]   It's a matter of recognition.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.240]   The best, simplest example is to think about whatever kind of car you drive, how
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.800]   by driving down the road, you can pick out that car half a mile away.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.800]   You can pick out the exact color and the Mike and model because you're tuned into
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.120]   that.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.280]   If you drive a red sports car or you decided you want to drive a red sports car,
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.600]   all you see are red sports cars.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.560]   But until then you never saw them.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.520]   Well, the same thing happens with knowledge.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.080]   So when you ask about the problems and you start talking about the challenges that
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.720]   you're facing, then you can systematically over time start to bump into the answers.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.800]   So ask questions about the big problems you're facing and then ask questions about
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.160]   the little problems you're facing.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.520]   Ask questions about the things in your life that aren't yet how you'd like them to
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:03.880]   be.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:09.520]   And you can start to learn the knowledge and ideas that will be helpful to you.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.400]   But knowledge is only the first step and knowledge has to be actually applied in
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.680]   order for it to be useful.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.640]   And that's where we turn to the topic of skills, which is our focus for today.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.040]   You have to develop the skills of success.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:30.400]   And where I first learned this concept was years ago through a Zig Ziglar set of CDs
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.080]   that I had that I listened to frequently.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.440]   Zig Ziglar was just an incredible speaker.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.440]   I always liked his style, I liked his southern accent and I liked his style.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.560]   And he was one of the first kind of success people that I ran into.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:48.440]   And he had this place on his tapes where he talked about what people want and he
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.560]   talked about how to build the skills of success in the areas that people want.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.920]   He would make the point that everybody wants just about the same thing in life.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.680]   And these things that people want, people want to be happy, they want to be
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   healthy, they want to be at least reasonably prosperous.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.160]   We all want to be secure.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.640]   We all want friends.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.360]   We all want peace of mind.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.040]   We all want good family relationships.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.880]   And we all want hope that tomorrow is going to be better than today.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.080]   And that was his discussion of what people want.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.280]   Personally, I think that's a pretty fair list.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.840]   It's at least a good place to start.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.800]   I don't know if it's a complete list or an incomplete list, doesn't matter.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.680]   But the most important part of that seminar was how he went on from the
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:44.400]   basis of what people want, and he talked about how to get what you want.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.760]   And he made the point and effectively proved it to me that each and every one
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.040]   of those things is a skill.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.160]   It's a learned skill.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.760]   Now, you've got to go listen to the seminar if you want to learn how
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.440]   happiness and health are learned skills or reasonably prosperous is learned skills.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.640]   I'm not going to repeat the whole thing here.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.880]   But he expanded that and it changed my worldview.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.600]   Because when I understood that all of those basic things were skills, it made
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.560]   me feel confident that I could learn and study and apply the knowledge that I
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.120]   learned to my life in order to learn those skills.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.720]   And when you feel empowered like that, it's life changing.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.120]   It's potentially life changing at least.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.920]   Because skill development is something that most of us, I think, can relate to.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.520]   We all have different areas that we're skilled in.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.000]   But when you look at things as skills, it makes us think of an ongoing process.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.920]   We recognize first that we're not going to be very good in the beginning.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:51.360]   Any skill that you've acquired or that you've developed, you probably weren't
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.160]   very good at that skill in the beginning.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.560]   But over time, you were able to build it and perfect it perhaps.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.760]   So one of the areas in wealth building that people get knocked off is we often
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.320]   don't do very well in the beginning.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.600]   We often don't have the highest paid job in the beginning.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.120]   We often make bad purchases in the beginning.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.360]   We often lose money in investments.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:23.080]   And if we let those things define us as who we are, then it has a tendency to
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.440]   stifle us and stop us.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:29.640]   But if we just simply see those things as skills that we're developing, then, well,
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:35.240]   we can be mediocre in the beginning and that doesn't spell ruin and doom.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.400]   It's just where we're starting.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:43.480]   The concept of skills is powerful because there's a progression.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.040]   It's also powerful because it means that we never stop.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.680]   And that's where with wealth building, people often make the mistake of looking
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.400]   for that one thing, that one idea, that one deal.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.320]   Do those things exist?
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:57.880]   Maybe.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:03.200]   There can be one major deal that makes a big difference in some people's lives.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.240]   But usually it's not one major deal.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.040]   It's usually a series of little deals.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.160]   I love the title of one of John Schaub's books.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.960]   It's the book he retitled into "Building Wealth One House at a Time," but the old
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.360]   title of it, I think, was "Making it Big on Little Deals."
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.880]   That you don't need one major thing.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.040]   You just need a lot of little progressions, little steps in the right
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.560]   direction.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:36.960]   And when you have the confidence that you just need a lot of little steps in the
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.680]   right direction, you'll systematically probably be able to more effectively keep
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.280]   going through the earlier ones where they're difficult to press forward to the
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.520]   ones where they are going to be more fruitful at the back end.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:58.560]   So as you face 2016, a good journaling exercise for you to do would be this.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:05.320]   Ask yourself, what are the skills that you need to focus on and develop in order
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.160]   to grow towards your wealth?
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:13.680]   And which of those skills will have the most impact, the most immediate impact
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.280]   for you?
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   Make a list and brainstorm some skills.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:24.960]   I'd encourage you not to constrain these skills to money and to wealth.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:32.440]   I'd encourage you to expand your list to the skills of life.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.200]   The skills of excellent communication with your spouse are going to be more
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:43.160]   impactful than how many dollars are in your IRA, as far as impactful to your
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.080]   level of happiness.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.960]   And it's a lot cheaper and easier to build better communication skills with
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.600]   your spouse than it is to save a million dollars in your IRA.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:58.120]   But since this is radical personal finance, let's talk about some of the
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.760]   skills of wealth that you can focus on.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.160]   Starting with the first part of the radical personal finance framework, number
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.320]   one, increasing income.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.680]   What are the skills that you can and should work on to increase your earnings
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.960]   and your earning ability?
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:18.480]   Are there specific job skills that you could develop?
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:25.120]   Do you need to retool your skills because you're facing a transition point in
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:25.600]   life?
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.480]   Making a New Year's resolution to make more money might be a good starting
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.040]   place.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:38.240]   Setting a goal to increase your income by, say, 10% this year might be a better
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.280]   starting place.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.680]   But that goal is only going to be practical if it's connected to a plan, and
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.280]   that plan is going to have to involve skills of some kind.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.640]   For me, it's skills of -- major focus.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.360]   2016, for me, major focus is to massively improve my skills with written
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.480]   communication, with my email list, with all of you who've signed up for the email
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:07.200]   list. Major undone thing for me in my life.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.400]   Another major skill is to develop the skill of finding out what are the
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:17.920]   specific courses and products that I can develop and offer to you, the audience,
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.200]   that will be life-changing for you.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.840]   So I've got to develop all the skills of creating those products, designing the
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.320]   outlines, and I want to make them world-class.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.920]   I've got lots of ideas, but those are all skills.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.000]   Once I've done about 10 of them, I'll probably start to get okay at it, and
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.680]   then another 20 or 30, and I'll probably start to be world-class.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.120]   But it's just a skill.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.920]   So what are the job skills that you need?
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.080]   Do you need to develop people skills?
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:47.040]   Do you need to focus on communication skills, leadership skills?
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:54.560]   Is your opportunity specific and tactical, or is it big picture?
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.640]   Do you need to upgrade a level of leadership, where you go from leading in
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.120]   specifics to leading in vision?
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.960]   What are the skills that you need to increase income?
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:10.000]   I'd encourage you, pause the podcast and brainstorm a list if you're in an
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.360]   environment where you can do that.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.440]   If you're driving in your car, hit pause and use the voice recorder app, or use a
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.600]   dictation into an Evernote file or into an email file, use the voice dictation on
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.560]   your phone, and just spend some time brainstorming a list of the skills that
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.320]   would help you to increase your income.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.800]   Next, what about decreasing expenses?
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.880]   What are the skills that for you will lead to decreasing your expenses?
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.480]   Do you struggle with impulse buying?
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:47.080]   Well, you should focus on developing the skill of not buying on impulse.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.480]   That's a learned skill.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.080]   Now, in an ideal world, hopefully your parents taught this to you.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.560]   Or in an ideal world, hopefully you had some life experience that taught
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.760]   this to you early in life.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.280]   For me, it was one of those little radio-controlled cars.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.640]   Well, there've been various ones.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.080]   I'll tell two stories just because they, I think, illustrate.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.680]   One, I remember so much.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.480]   I desperately wanted one of those little radio-controlled cars, little things you
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.800]   squeeze the trigger and drive the thing around.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.480]   I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.240]   And so my parents gave me the opportunity to buy it with my own money.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.560]   I remember just jumping on that thing and buying it.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:33.080]   And I remember how utterly bored I was a week later with a toy that I was so
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.240]   enthusiastic about.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:43.880]   When you save and then spend quickly on something and it doesn't bring you any
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:50.320]   lasting satisfaction, you learn not to continue so long with buying that stuff.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:57.160]   Another way I learned not to be an impulsive spender on little things was one
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:04.000]   summer I worked on a farm and I had the opportunity and I was mainly out in the
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.320]   fields and I got very bored because I was driving a tractor around all day.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.320]   And this was while I was in high school.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.320]   And I would very much look forward to my lunch break and my mid-afternoon break.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.680]   And there was a gas station a couple of miles down the road that had some pretty
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.960]   decent gas station food, specifically some pretty good chicken wings.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:26.640]   And I was a little bit lazy about going and packing my lunch and packing my snacks
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.800]   to eat. And so I'd wind up at that gas station.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.480]   In retrospect, I was able to calculate probably two to three times a day.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.520]   I'd like to go in the morning, get a coffee.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.040]   At lunchtime, I'd swing down there, get some lunch.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.440]   In the afternoon, maybe I'd swing by and get something else.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:46.320]   Well, that particular summer, at the end of the summer, it came time to start
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.400]   paying my dad the money that I owed him for my tuition bills.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.120]   And I would usually be able to earn in the course of a summer about two to
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.080]   three thousand dollars.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.560]   So I'd usually wind up at the end of a summer of work in high school with about
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.680]   two or three thousand dollars in my checking account, which I would spend down
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.680]   over the course of the school year.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.520]   As I remember, I think I paid my dad a hundred dollars a month for my tuition at
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.040]   a private school and some things like other just miscellaneous high school student
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:16.960]   expenses. Well, that particular summer, as I remember, we were basically had seven
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.720]   or eight hundred dollars in my checking account.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.680]   And I'm sitting there counting things up and trying to figure out where did my
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.180]   money go?
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:28.080]   And so my father at that time forced me to go back to go back and do a an
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   investigative audit of my finances and figure out where my money had gone.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:39.200]   And I was quite chagrined to find that I had spent at least a thousand dollars,
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.960]   possibly much more on chicken wings and soda from the gas station.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:49.120]   And that year I was broke the entire year because I'd wasted all my money
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.960]   frivolously on stupid impulse purchases that I didn't track.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.520]   That lesson went deep.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:02.160]   So I had the opportunity to learn those skills with hard lessons young in life.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.520]   That's very helpful to me now.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:11.280]   Ideally, if you didn't have those lessons, perhaps you can learn from my stupidity
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.400]   and other people's stupidity.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.800]   But if not, think about how you can develop the skill of not buying on impulse.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.360]   Recognize that your behavior is not fixed.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.080]   It's not the way it's always got to be.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:24.960]   You can change it.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.200]   You can learn a new skill.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.720]   And so whether that means you put some guardrails on your credit card and your
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.960]   check card and spend cash out of an envelope, whether it means you institute a
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.880]   mandatory 30-day waiting period on any purchase over $20 or over $100, whatever
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.200]   it is, make a plan to learn and develop the skill.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:53.680]   Perhaps it's the skill of careful purchasing, and that's what you need, is you
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.320]   develop the skills of researching decisions.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.080]   So you can integrate this and say, "Well, over the next 30 days, I'm going to
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:00.960]   research this decision.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.680]   I'm going to figure out how can I get the best bang for my buck."
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:08.320]   One of the things that's so sad, if you look at people who are broke, you often
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:14.000]   will find that they have the same things that people who are not broke have, but
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.760]   they just buy cheap versions of them.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.920]   And those cheap versions are always breaking down, and they can't seem to make
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:25.600]   a good purchase that's going to lead to a lower life cycle cost.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.160]   So they buy all the fancy stuff, but they buy the cheap versions that break down
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.920]   and have no residual value, where somebody who's wealthy has probably developed
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.080]   some habits of careful purchasing.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.240]   So they think carefully about their purchases.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.480]   They plan their purchases in advance.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.240]   They carefully choose purchases that don't depreciate very much in value.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.320]   So that on the back end of the life cycle of ownership, they can sell the item
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.360]   back into the market, and it has a lower cost to them.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.760]   Frankly, you can drive with good skills of careful purchasing.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:03.280]   You can drive a luxury car, have lots of luxury products, and you'll have luxury
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.200]   products with a lower price tag than cheap, inferior products.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.680]   That is a skill.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.680]   It can be focused on, developed, and learned.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.920]   What are the skills that will help you to decrease expenses?
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.720]   These skills have to be appropriate to where you are.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:26.640]   If your food bill is out of hand, maybe your skill is, "How can I really develop
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.920]   the skill of decreasing our food expenses?"
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.400]   But perhaps it's not a food bill.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.520]   Perhaps it's something else.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.680]   How can I develop a skill?
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.160]   And you can be as tactical and specific, kind of learning the skill of changing
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.840]   my own oil or performing some of my own car repairs in order to save money at
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.640]   the mechanic, or very, very big picture.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.840]   That's up to you.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.560]   Just ask yourself, "What are the skills that will help you to decrease your
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.040]   expenses?"
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.320]   Next, investments.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.920]   What are the skills that you need to learn that will lead to your making wiser
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.560]   investments?
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:04.000]   First skill with investing is always the skill of saving money diligently and
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.880]   setting it aside.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:10.160]   At the front end of your investing career, that is the major skill set that's
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:10.480]   needed.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.800]   And so one component of that is, yes, higher income.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.040]   Another component is, yes, lower expenses.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.560]   But a major component is the skill of forcefully saving money right off the
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.920]   top, paying yourself first, figuring out a plan that's going to allow you to
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   fund your investment account, whether it's as simple as going down and
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:37.200]   increasing your 401(k) contributions or putting an automatic transfer on your
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:42.800]   checking account so that on the day that your direct deposit hits your account,
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   some amount of money goes into a savings account.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.680]   It can be simple or it can be complex.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:53.760]   But in your area of chosen focus, then you need to develop more skills around
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.520]   investing.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.960]   Depending on the type of investing, perhaps you are pursuing a trading
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.160]   strategy, so then you've got to develop skills of trading stocks.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   Or if you are in something like real estate investment, you're buying and
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.160]   selling single family houses, then there are skills that are associated with
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:12.320]   that.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.000]   There's the skills of finding the deals.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.080]   There's the skill of negotiating a great deal.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.720]   There are the skills of managing crews of people to fix things up.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.000]   Each of those is a skill that can be studied and focused and developed.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.600]   And those skills, when systematically practiced, are what lead to a mature
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.240]   investor.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.520]   And these skills, when comprehensively practiced, are what lead to a mature,
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.840]   wealthy person.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:50.560]   It's a systematic application, development, and perfection of skills.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   The final point I'd like to make on the topic of skill development is simply
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:03.520]   that skills, that the necessary skills change and they develop.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.760]   As time goes forward.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.160]   If you consider somebody like an athlete, a professional athlete, professional
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.800]   football player, professional football player has perfected some skills.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:21.440]   But just because they've perfected some skills doesn't mean that they can avoid
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.440]   and ignore skill development.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.840]   Just means that the skills are different.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.800]   When they were playing peewee football, there were a certain type of skills,
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.840]   certain levels of skill that they needed to focus on.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.640]   And it's the same thing in wealth building.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.400]   The peewee football scenario is simple things like the skill of getting a job,
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.720]   the skill of making a resume, the skill of not getting fired from the job, the
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.000]   skill of paying your bills on time, the skill of managing a checkbook.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.040]   That's peewee football.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.400]   When you get into the big leagues, you still have to be developing skills,
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.120]   but they're different.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.120]   So when you're leading a company with hundreds of employees, it's a very
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.120]   different skill set than when you had zero.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:13.600]   Or when you're managing a portfolio of $5 million, that's a very different skill
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.400]   set than when you had $5,000 in the bank.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:23.200]   But it's still just a system and a series of skills, something that can be
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.560]   learned, developed, improved, and perfected.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.200]   I hope that these ideas are useful to you.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.200]   I guess it's hard for me to know.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.560]   Sometimes I struggle with articulation.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:42.080]   It's hard for me to know if these ideas are as life-changing for other people as
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:42.720]   they were for me.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.880]   But for me, looking at life as a series of skills to be developed was very freeing
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:54.320]   because it eliminated much of the emotion around who I am and who I'm not, this
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.720]   idea that I'm this kind of person that's this way.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.000]   And it just made it simpler, made it recognize that I'm who I am, but I can
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.680]   learn and apply different skills.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:10.720]   And with the application of different skills over time, I can make major
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.680]   changes in my life.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.360]   So that's the core of what I wanted to share with you.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.560]   It's hopefully an appropriate New Year's message.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.720]   If 2015 treated you well, congratulations.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.040]   May 2016 be even better.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:31.840]   If 2015 treated you poorly, to borrow another Zig Ziglar aphorism, another one
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:36.480]   that I always just love, always found very encouraging, remember this, "Failure
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.120]   is an event.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.720]   It's not a person.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.920]   Yesterday ended last night, and today is a brand new day."
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.640]   Sounds cheesy, but to me, I love that quote, and I've often said it to myself.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.880]   I'm excited about walking with you here in 2016.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.000]   It's going to be a big year.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.640]   I thank each and every one of you who listens to the show.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.640]   A couple of quick announcements as we go.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:02.480]   Number one, you will notice if you are someone who subscribes to the show on a
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   mobile device, something like that, and also it reads on the website and gets
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:11.520]   the emails, you'll notice a delay when in shows being posted to the website,
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.240]   perhaps by as much as a couple days.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.320]   This is due to me eliminating a bottleneck in my production line.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.720]   The bottleneck is producing the graphics for the website.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.800]   So if you would like the quickest access to the show, the best way to do that is
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.560]   to subscribe on your phone.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.040]   Best way to subscribe on the phone is to download our free mobile app.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.760]   So just search the app store on your phone for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.040]   You'll find our free mobile app, and that will allow you to subscribe to the
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.600]   show, and you'll get the shows as soon as they're published that way.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.640]   If you have an iPhone, feel free to use my iPhone app or feel free to use the
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.080]   built-in Apple Podcasts app.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.480]   That's either one is fine, or iTunes.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:51.280]   Any place that you subscribe to the feed, like an iTunes subscription, that will
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.120]   be the fastest way to get the shows.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.880]   Then the shows will show up on the website a couple days later after my
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.160]   graphic designer creates the artwork for the show.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.640]   Just a quick note, hopefully that's useful to some of you.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:08.560]   By the way, if any of you are listening in iTunes and would like to leave the
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.480]   show a review, please leave the show a rating and review.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.880]   That's always helpful in the iTunes rankings.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.840]   So if you could take a moment on your phone, just do that.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.160]   You can do it right from within the Apple Podcasts app.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.040]   Just hit the star, leave a quick one-sentence rating and review.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.400]   That would be super helpful.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.440]   And I will be back with you tomorrow with a great show.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:35.600]   Thanks for listening.
