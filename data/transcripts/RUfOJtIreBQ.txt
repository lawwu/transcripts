[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.860]   Is it sinful to desire death as an escape from the pain of this world and to escape
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.960]   the pain caused by our own sinfulness?
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.920]   Marissa, a listener to the podcast, is brave enough to ask it.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.160]   Dear Pastor John, is it a sin to long to go home?
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.240]   I am a 31 year old and my life is ruined.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.800]   I dread the rest of my life.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.320]   Because of sin, I have lost everyone I love most, and I mean everyone.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.600]   I feel like my very poor choices can't be redeemed while here on earth even though I
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.440]   have repented and confessed of my sins.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.360]   I am terrified of what awaits me including having to remain single until I die because
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.480]   of an ensuing divorce that I don't want but did cause, and never having the blessing of
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.680]   forming a family.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.720]   Is it a sin to want to go home and to be with Jesus?
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.880]   Your teachings are among the few things that keep me going.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.920]   Pastor John, what would you say to Marissa?
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:20.440]   Marissa, let me give what I think is a clear biblical answer in general to your question
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:30.640]   and then circle around to your situation in particular with some, I pray, hopeful words.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.520]   The biblical answer in general is that it is not a sin to long for heaven and for the
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:50.160]   presence of Christ with a sense of aching dismay over the sin and sorrows of this world
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.440]   and of our own lives.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:01.760]   In fact, I would say that the more one knows of the real condition of this world and the
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:11.560]   more one grieves over the remaining corruption of our own hearts, the more natural it is
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.280]   to long for heaven and Christ.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.560]   "Oh, that day when freed from sinning I shall see his lovely face, full arrayed in
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.920]   blood-washed linen, how I'll sing his sovereign grace.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:36.280]   Come, come, my Lord, no longer tarry, bring thy promises to pass, for I know thy power
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.240]   will keep me till I'm home with thee at last."
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:49.600]   When Robert Robeson wrote that verse of "Come, Thou Fount" 150 years ago, he was not
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.480]   mentally unstable.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.160]   He was full of the Holy Spirit, full of grace, full of wisdom, and full of longing, a longing
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.880]   that every saint tastes.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.560]   That's what we long for, the day when we'd be free from sinning, the thing we want most
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.240]   to be free of in this life is dishonoring the Lord by our own sin.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.280]   I mean, there are troubles in the world and there are pain in the world, but the most
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.240]   grievous thing is sin in our own soul in the world.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.920]   So Paul says more than once, Philippians 1, 21, "My desire is to depart and be with
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.640]   Christ, for that is far better."
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.480]   And then he adds, "But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.560]   And convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.480]   progress and joy in the faith."
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.800]   Or here he is again, 2 Corinthians 5, 6-9, "We are always of good courage.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.040]   We know that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord, for we walk by
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.720]   faith and not by sight.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:13.000]   Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   the Lord."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.600]   There it is, so clear.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.460]   So whether we are away or at home, we make it our aim to please Him.
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.520]   So there's the biblical answer, Marissa, in general.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.120]   To long to be at home with the Lord is not a sin.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.800]   It is biblical, and it is healthy.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.840]   Now the reason I say that's the general answer is that I can imagine a situation when it
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.040]   would be a sin to want to die and go to be with Jesus.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:57.160]   Did you notice that in both Philippians 1 and 2 Corinthians 5, Paul knew that going
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:05.000]   home to be with Jesus was not yet God's will for him, and he took this from the hand
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.420]   of God with confidence that God would give him the strength and the grace for the life
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:20.080]   that was not his first choice, the life he was going to live as he remained on the earth.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.000]   He said, "I know that I will remain and continue with you all," though my first choice would
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.280]   be to go and be with the Lord.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:37.960]   And the key is found in 2 Corinthians 5, where he says, "We walk by faith and not by sight."
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.760]   And that brings me to your situation, Marissa.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:50.840]   I want to encourage you that the ruin and dread that you see in front of you for the
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   rest of your life is not in fact reality.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.600]   At least it need not be.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.280]   Here are your key phrases.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.040]   They're very bleak.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.960]   My life is ruined.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.600]   I dread the rest of my life.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.920]   I feel like my very poor choices can't be redeemed while on the earth.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.000]   I am terrified of what awaits me.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:28.280]   But Jesus would say, "When you say this, is this faith talking or sight talking?"
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.720]   We live by faith and not by sight.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.040]   Is this faith talking or is this sight talking?
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.520]   Jesus is calling you, Marissa, to walk by faith and not by sight.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.520]   I agree.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.360]   From what you can see—see with the eyes of your head—from what you can see, the
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.080]   future looks hopeless, dreadful, terrifying, unredeemable.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.080]   That's true.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.080]   It does.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.400]   But that's just not the way you have to live.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.840]   We walk by faith, not by sight.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:09.160]   And remember—this is so amazing—Paul said this about himself.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:16.240]   He said this in the same breath as saying, "We would rather be away from the body and
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.480]   at home with the Lord."
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.900]   He wasn't blind.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.600]   He knew that his future on earth would be full of sorrow, full of pain.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.640]   Listen to this verse from Acts 20.23.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:35.800]   "The Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   me."
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.920]   It wasn't a possibility for Paul.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.600]   It was guaranteed.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.080]   Pain is on the way, Paul.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.080]   Till you have your head chopped off, it's on the way.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.480]   He's not going to be ripped out of a life of comfort when he's martyred.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.400]   He's going to be ripped out of a life of misery when he's martyred.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.920]   He had no prospect of retirement with ease.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.640]   He would be killed for Christ in the midst of afflictions, not the midst of comfort.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.400]   That's what he saw with the eyes of the flesh.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.120]   But with the eyes of faith, he saw miracles happening in him and through him.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:22.080]   So he said, "Whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please Him."
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.720]   So here's a promise for you, Marissa.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.760]   I believe God has given me this for you.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:38.600]   Isaiah 58, verse 10, "If you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:49.960]   of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noon
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.640]   day."
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:09:02.040]   The Lord will guide you, Marissa, continually, and satisfy your desire in scorched places
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.160]   and make your bones strong.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:16.320]   And you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water whose waters do not fail.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:27.200]   And then Isaiah 56, "I will give in my house and within my walls, I will give you a monument
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.560]   and a name better than sons and daughters.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:37.680]   I will give you an everlasting name that shall not be cut off."
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:46.320]   So yes, Marissa, long for heaven, long for Christ, long for the day when we will sin
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:56.840]   no more, but trust His promises now, like Paul, as he faced a painful future and walked
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.040]   by faith, not by sight.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.360]   God's promise for you is fruit in the midst of this sorrow.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.400]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Marissa.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.720]   You know, we sometimes get emails from people struggling with depression, so it's really
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.400]   important to implore you.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.640]   If you are struggling with ongoing depression, you need to bring this to the attention of
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.000]   your pastor, your doctor, and likely to a counselor, too.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.440]   You will need the kind of in-person help that we cannot offer through this podcast.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.720]   And if this is true of someone you know struggling with depression, too, you need to help them
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.280]   find help.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.600]   As we talked about on this podcast, depression is complex, from low-grade depression to debilitating
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   depression.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.560]   It's all made complex by this marriage of our physical and spiritual lives together.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.840]   But I can assure you, depression is not uncommon to Christians.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.760]   If you struggle here, you're not alone, and you should not remain alone.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.080]   Many Christians have struggled, and there is nothing to be ashamed of in speaking up
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.880]   and seeking out help.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:05.040]   Well, Wednesday we return to take up one of the increasingly common questions faced by
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.800]   pastors, and that is when a gay couple is converted and regenerated, or even if one
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.920]   partner is, and he or she needs wisdom on how to proceed in thinking about their living
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.640]   arrangements, what should be done?
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.840]   What counsel should be offered by the pastor?
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.360]   This is not a hypothetical question, trust me.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.280]   It's one we see more and more as pastors send in email questions to the inbox, and it's
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.440]   a question on the table on Wednesday.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.480]   I'm your host Tony Renke, we'll see you then.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:31.980]   [END]
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:32.980]   1.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:33.980]   What counsel should be offered by the pastor?
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.980]   2.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.980]   Should a gay couple be converted?
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.980]   3.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:37.980]   Should a pastor be a Christian?
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.980]   4.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.980]   Should a gay couple be a Christian?
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.980]   5.
