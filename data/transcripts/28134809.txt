[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   - Welcome, friends, to this episode
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.240]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.920]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.640]   and I am excited to spend some time today with you
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.840]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.840]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.320]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.360]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.480]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.580]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.680]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.680]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.840]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.640]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.900]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.900]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.320]   to another episode of the Everyday Educator podcast,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.960]   and I am especially excited to welcome
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.160]   one of my dear friends to talk about something
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.080]   that has become increasingly dear to my heart.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.920]   We wanna talk today about educating yourself.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.240]   We spend lots of weeks talking about
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.840]   how we can be better homeschool moms and dads
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.500]   to the children that the Lord has entrusted to us.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.880]   But today, I wanna turn our attention
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.400]   to educating ourselves.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.160]   What does God call us to do,
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.540]   and how would we go about that,
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.840]   even if we felt like we had the bandwidth to do it?
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.340]   So I have invited a dear friend
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.340]   who, to me, is a wonderful example
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   of what a lifelong learner can become, is and can become.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.680]   So welcome, Heatherly Sylvia, to the podcast.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.680]   Heatherly, thanks so much for joining me today.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.680]   - Thank you for inviting me to come back,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.880]   and thank you for allowing me to talk about
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.000]   one of my absolutely favorite topics.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.760]   - Well, I know that you are a lifelong learner.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.160]   I know that it's a passion for you,
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.000]   and I really, really believe that you love it so much
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.840]   and have grown into it to such a degree
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.040]   that you're gonna be able to help all of us see,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.400]   oh, I don't know, how we could get started,
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.340]   how we could keep going,
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.960]   and maybe what lies ahead if we press on.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.080]   So thank you for sharing.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.140]   Let me ask you this.
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.260]   I just wanna start off with this.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.260]   Did you like learning back when you were a student?
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.060]   When you were formerly a student,
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.600]   when that was your main job, did you like to learn?
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.940]   - I don't know how to answer this question.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.940]   So I was, back in my day, back in the olden times,
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.720]   we were split up in our classes
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.960]   by what the school gauged was our academic level.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.300]   So I was always in the top level,
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.400]   the smart kids class, whatever.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   I read early, I was pretty quick, but I loved to read.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.220]   I don't know that I loved to learn, but I loved to read,
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.620]   and I have a really strong memory.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.620]   So I was able to coast through school
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.240]   all the way through elementary school,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.720]   all the way through seventh grade,
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.540]   and then I got to eighth grade,
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.600]   and my science teacher expected me
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.420]   to actually know how to study.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.160]   And the problem was that I was a smart kid
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.800]   with a good memory,
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.120]   and so I had never learned any kind of study skills.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.800]   I had never learned how to summarize, review.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.520]   No, I never had to.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.520]   And so when Mr. Nickerson expected us to study our notes
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.920]   that we took in class and then pass quizzes and tests,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.140]   I really, really struggled.
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.020]   And that was my wall, was eighth grade science.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.300]   And after that, even though I was in honors classes,
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.640]   I did very, very well in my humanities classes,
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.580]   but no one even then stopped and said,
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.860]   "Okay, let's get you some study skills."
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.480]   My parents were both teachers,
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.860]   and neither of them noticed that I needed study skills.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.860]   So I loved to read and I loved to learn,
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.780]   but I didn't like being a student.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.600]   - Isn't that so interesting?
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.280]   Because I have done kind of an informal poll
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   just of other homeschooling parents and friends
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.340]   that I have all over the country,
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.340]   and this comes up a lot, Heatherly.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.520]   There were lots of us who loved to read
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.080]   and who found memorizing things really easy,
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.400]   but whose teachers, and I will be perfectly honest,
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.020]   it is possible that I had teachers
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.320]   that tried to teach me how to learn and how to study,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.060]   and I just don't remember it.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.820]   But I do, I also recall thinking,
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.060]   "Wait, what is this study for a test that you mentioned?"
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.500]   I've never, I don't know what that is.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.180]   I can remember, I was in the fourth or fifth grade,
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.660]   and it had never occurred to me
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.180]   that there was a way to study for a test.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.020]   I think it's interesting that your parents as teachers
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.140]   just kind of apparently thought
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.140]   that you would just grow naturally into these study skills.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.100]   - Absolutely, and it's just a reminder to me
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.820]   that as I'm coming alongside my kiddos,
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.180]   that I, when I'm working shoulder to shoulder with them,
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.260]   that there is a lot of value in stopping
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.940]   and making sure that not only do they know
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.020]   what it is that we're talking about,
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.260]   but they also understand how I got to the answers I did,
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.380]   how to find an answer in the book, how to study.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.980]   So I have, I didn't learn how to study
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.880]   until I was an education major in college,
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.420]   and when I had to learn how to teach kids study skills,
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.420]   that's when I learned.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.180]   Now, obviously, the study skills that I learned
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.260]   in order to teach in a modern system
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.820]   are very different from the skills that I have gathered
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.660]   and added to my copiousness as a classical homeschooler
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.180]   and as a classical teacher.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.060]   But that at least started me on the path.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.860]   I was starting to regain some ground
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.780]   and realizing, oh, I can learn how to learn things.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.820]   So I would say becoming a student
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.180]   didn't actually kick in as a pleasurable thing
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.460]   until I was a junior in college.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.380]   - Isn't that interesting?
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.900]   And you know, it seems to me that maybe learning
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.460]   became more pleasurable for you
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.500]   when you had some of the skills
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.500]   that made it a pleasant thing.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.140]   - That's absolutely true, yes.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.260]   So just, this is kind of maybe an aside,
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.340]   but maybe this would be very helpful
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.140]   for us to delineate for our listeners.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:36.140]   What would you say are some of the basic skills of studying
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.500]   or the basic tools of learning
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.400]   that we need to be sure that our children acquire?
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.820]   - So it'd be, the first one I would say
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.100]   is if we start when they're really little
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.420]   with the skill of narration,
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.940]   which is a classical skill and it can be done orally
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.640]   and it can be done written, in the written form.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.880]   But if you just ask a student to tell you back
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.020]   what they just heard, that is one of the first skills,
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.420]   just being able to mimic back,
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.660]   making sure they're actually hearing you
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.420]   and that they're understanding what it is
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.260]   that they just read or what they just heard.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.620]   So narration is an amazing skill.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.260]   As adults, we can do this simply by writing
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.540]   a quick couple of sentences about what we just read
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.420]   or our sermon notes, writing down,
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.460]   like this is what I think the main idea of this sermon was
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.660]   or the main idea of this Bible passage were.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.940]   - Or this paragraph that I just read.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.260]   - Absolutely, so the second skill I would say
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.940]   is when we enter the Essentials Program,
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.660]   which is ages nine to 11 typically
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.980]   in classical conversations, you learn through the IEW
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.140]   or Institute for Excellence in Writing,
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.500]   you learn through that program how to create a K-W-O,
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.940]   which is how to take words and ideas
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.740]   and kind of minimize them
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.220]   and then expand them in your own words.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.300]   That is an amazing study skill.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.900]   And outlining, which you learn in IEW
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.020]   and then you learn again
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.300]   as you go through the challenge years.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.460]   Summarizing, being able to take a lot of information
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.220]   and put it down to a small sentence
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.260]   or a small paragraph
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.260]   and then being able to memorize information.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.500]   So whether you're memorizing vocabulary words or catechism,
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.940]   which is how we do our foundations memory work,
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.300]   where we ask a question and get an answer.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.860]   All of those are amazing study skills
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.700]   and they're all things that our students have
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.460]   by the time that they're 12 years old.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.220]   And many of us moms and dads are trying to recapture.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.300]   - Yes, yes.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.300]   I can remember when my older daughter went to college
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:02.060]   in one of the upper level political science classes
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.940]   she had to take.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.380]   She came home for a break
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.740]   and was telling me all of this information
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.660]   that she had to remember.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.260]   She was taking about the Middle East.
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.900]   It was about countries of the Middle East
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.380]   and she had to know the population
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.700]   and the gross national product
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.380]   and all of these different figures
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.900]   for about 10 or 12 different countries.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.340]   And it was daunting to me.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.940]   And I said, how are you able to do this?
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.500]   This was just one class she was taking one test.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.380]   And she said, oh, it is so great
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.660]   because of all the memorizing that we did
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.020]   when we were little in foundations.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.020]   She said, I have figured out what it takes my brain
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:52.020]   to memorize material quickly and hold on to it.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.820]   And I thought, wow, what a gift we are giving our children
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.420]   when we teach them to memorize.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.180]   - And it's wonderful because that's not a skill
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.660]   that ends in foundations.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.620]   - Yes, you keep going.
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.460]   - All through challenge.
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.940]   In fact, I am this year tutoring challenge four
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.260]   which is our capstone year.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.780]   And my students have a memorized exposition speech
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.420]   that they'll be presenting this coming week.
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.140]   So we continue to practice, like your daughter said,
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.540]   figuring out how do you memorize
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.740]   so that you can have that large amount of information
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.860]   at your fingertips.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.940]   - Yeah, it's great.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.020]   And that's just one of the skills
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.900]   that we will give our children as adults.
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.500]   'Cause that's what I wanted to ask you about.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.500]   How do you feel now about learning as an adult?
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.180]   And does this seem like necessary?
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.500]   Does it seem necessary to you
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.740]   to keep on learning as a grownup?
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.740]   And what helps you to be a grownup learner?
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.460]   - I started reclaiming my education
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.740]   after I became a homeschooler.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.260]   So by the time I became a classical homeschooler in 2014,
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.060]   I was just so hungry to know everything.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.020]   And so the things that have...
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.500]   First of all, yes, I see it as necessary.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.500]   It's not just my job as a challenge for a director
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.780]   to make sure that I am continuing to learn
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.180]   and that I'm helping the parents
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.260]   know how to teach their kiddos.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.860]   But it's also my job.
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.180]   I started an organization with my friends, Tim and Sarah.
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:42.100]   And our whole purpose is to encourage and equip
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.580]   lifelong learners.
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.500]   So even when you're done homeschooling,
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.940]   or even if you aren't a homeschooler,
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.700]   how do you become a lifelong learner?
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.420]   So I see it as necessary.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.100]   It's actually my passion.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.100]   So how do I feel about it?
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:55.940]   I love it.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.060]   It's my favorite thing in the world to learn new things,
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.260]   to talk about them with my friends, to have discussions,
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.380]   to be able to help somebody else learn something new.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.180]   These are all things that I am just passionate about.
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.740]   I think that part of the reason I'm so passionate about it
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.420]   is because I left high school,
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.940]   having been told by my physics teacher
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.140]   that I was the dumb kid in the smart class.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.300]   And then I really struggled my first few years of college.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.140]   So I really feel like I'm making up ground.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.300]   And I know lots of other homeschool moms and dads
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.300]   that feel the same way.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.940]   We feel like we're making ground.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.260]   So I do think it's necessary.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.900]   The first homeschool mentor icon that I met
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.140]   was Charlotte Mason through her writings.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.300]   And she talks about the mother culture
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.980]   and the idea that a part of the mother culture
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.540]   is always being a little bit ahead of your students
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.020]   so that you could teach them well.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.660]   And I took that very seriously.
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.860]   And that lacking, that not knowing how to be
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.140]   a couple of steps ahead in certain areas
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.740]   is actually what directly led to me joining
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.100]   a classical conversations community.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.260]   I was really struggling with helping my students
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.420]   to memorize because at that point,
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.220]   I hadn't learned how to memorize.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.500]   I just knew, I just have such a good memory
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.260]   I didn't have to.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.940]   So teaching my kids how to, that led to me joining CC,
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.380]   which led to me learning about the great books movement,
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.660]   which led to me learning about Plato and Socrates
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.700]   and Aristotle, which led to me learning about
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.180]   all of these different works of literature
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.540]   that even in my time as an English major
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.620]   and as a theater major, I had never encountered.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.380]   So I had a passion for Shakespeare,
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.900]   but all of the other greats somehow missed.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.980]   So I do think it's necessary.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.340]   I don't think it's always necessary to do all the things,
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.740]   but I do think it's always necessary for us
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.220]   to have something that we're learning.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.900]   And I don't think it necessarily
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.300]   has to be strictly academic.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   I think that those mamas that are learning to cook
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.180]   and really exploring baking, or if there's a dad
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.100]   that has a hobby that they're really spending
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.900]   a lot of time learning about and pouring their time into,
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.060]   I think that that is just as important
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.100]   as reading the greats.
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.340]   - Yep.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.380]   Yes, I think it's necessary
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.260]   for everybody who's alive to learn.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:57.260]   Because for me, it's a way to participate in life,
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.420]   to move through life and be curious and ask questions
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.580]   and not know the answer and figure out
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.580]   how to find the answer.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.980]   And I love that you said it doesn't have
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.820]   to just be academics because some of the things
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.260]   that I'm learning now are not academic.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.180]   I'm gonna tell you this, I have not told many people this.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.380]   I am learning to play the drums.
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.700]   - Oh, that's so fun.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.460]   - That is not the most hilarious thing you've ever heard.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.540]   I can remember when I was in the fifth grade,
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.420]   I really wanted to learn to play the drums
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.220]   and my fifth grade band teacher said,
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.900]   I promise you he said this,
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.780]   "The drums are just for the boys."
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.340]   - I feel like your band teacher and my physics teacher
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.780]   need to go hang out.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.940]   - I think they need to not be in education anymore.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.100]   - Time out. (laughs)
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.100]   - And so I have started learning that.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.700]   Now I will tell you at the ripe old age that I am,
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.060]   my muscles are gonna have to get a lot of memory
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.020]   before I can be good at this.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:09.020]   But I'm curious and I am eager and I'm determined
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.260]   and I'm interested.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:16.260]   And so those are all the things that are necessary
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.660]   to be a learner.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.020]   You just have to be curious.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.660]   You just have to ask a question
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.300]   and you have to be willing to be really bad at it
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.540]   before you can be good at it.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.020]   So I feel like learning is necessary for grownups
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.580]   because that's how you know you're alive.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.660]   You're still asking questions.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.660]   - We talk about in the challenge program
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.740]   that everything that we're doing is pointing towards virtue.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.740]   It's pointing towards becoming a more complete Imago Dei.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:53.300]   So if we want to become more like the God that we love
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.300]   and are knowing and making known,
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.620]   we need to be curious about his creation.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.420]   And his creation is not just the trees and the birds.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.300]   His creation is also rhythm and order
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.980]   and the science of baking and cooking
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.460]   and just all of the things that make us
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.580]   a more complete human being in the image of God.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.900]   And I think that there's,
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.700]   we just, especially in classical circles,
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.420]   I think that when people are new to it,
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.820]   they are intimidated because they think,
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.420]   oh, I could never read Shakespeare.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.260]   I hate Shakespeare.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.660]   I could never read Plato.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.620]   I'm too intimidated by these things.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.660]   And that that's not what we're talking about necessarily
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.900]   when we're talking about becoming a lifelong learner.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.580]   We're talking about baby steps.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.940]   We're talking about just being curious about something
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.580]   and learning about it and allowing that
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.580]   to make you a more complete human being.
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.980]   And I tell my challenge students all the time,
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.220]   I don't just want you to be bright.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.380]   I want you to be wise and I want you to be interesting.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.740]   So I think it's really important
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.940]   that we all just stay on that journey.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.260]   We stay on that path.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.900]   And we get to do that as homeschoolers.
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.300]   We have that opportunity built in, right?
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.380]   Because we're sitting shoulder to shoulder.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.420]   I was sharing that I'm reading "The Scarlet Letter"
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.300]   right now with my daughter who's in challenge one.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.500]   And we're reading it aloud together.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.580]   We're reading three chapters a day
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.500]   and we're just sitting next to each other
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.900]   and reading the book and discussing it
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.460]   and thinking about it and kind of laughing a little bit
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.140]   because it's a very funny book
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.540]   if you actually take the time to read the language.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.140]   And thank you, Stephanie, for those lovely footnotes
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.180]   that are helpful to reading it.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.900]   But I had never read "The Scarlet Letter"
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.900]   until I started homeschooling my kids
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.900]   and needed to read it in order to teach them.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.900]   So what a beautiful way to fill in the things
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.420]   that I see as gaps in my education.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.460]   - I think that's so good.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.300]   And I was gonna say, talk a little bit
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.860]   about the benefits of learning alongside our children.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.980]   And you've just mentioned it.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.620]   We do get to fill in the gaps of things that we missed
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.620]   or we skipped over or we skirted around in many cases.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.580]   We get to revisit those or be introduced to it
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.980]   when we learn with our kids.
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.740]   - I got to sit with my son this morning
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:40.620]   who is 17 and if he was in the school,
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.220]   we would call him a senior in high school.
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.220]   And we're reading a book about the ancients
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.940]   because we're about to start studying the Iliad.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.620]   And he had an absolutely earth-shattering,
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.100]   paradigm-shifting moment when we were reading today
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.900]   where he had to stop and put down the book
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.900]   and he just silently had to think.
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.740]   And I could just see the wheels turning
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.540]   and I started laughing and I said, "Buddy, are you okay?"
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.180]   And he's like, "I have so many thoughts right now."
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.860]   - Don't you love that?
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.860]   - It was amazing.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.860]   And if I had just, and please don't misunderstand me,
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.580]   I am not saying that every parent
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.340]   needs to read everything with their children.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.900]   I only have two children.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.980]   We enjoy reading together.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.340]   It's great for them, it's great for me,
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.260]   it's great quality time.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.980]   I understand that not every homeschool
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.380]   can function that way.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:46.180]   But if I wasn't learning alongside of him,
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.900]   I would have missed that moment.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.940]   And it was such a delightful, delicious moment
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.820]   to just watch his little brain explode,
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.860]   realizing a couple of things about the way
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.660]   that the ancients and biblical literature
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.140]   connect to our current political state.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.860]   - Wow, seeing those insights come across their face
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.420]   is one of the true blessings of homeschooling.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.660]   And you know, I did some of that too, Heather Lee.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.580]   I didn't read every book along with both of my kids
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.980]   and I didn't do every subject.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.860]   We picked things, I did all of chemistry
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.060]   with Sarah and man, we both were sanctified by that.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.020]   That is work chemistry and I remember from high school,
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.700]   I learned many lessons and taught many lessons
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.660]   about humility while we did that together.
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.980]   But there were times when I would be reading something
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.420]   with one or the other of them and they would have
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.700]   such a profound insight that my mouth would hang open.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.100]   And I would frequently say to them,
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.420]   would you wait while I write that down?
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.260]   Because that is a thought I've never had
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.580]   and now I'm gonna need to think about that.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.540]   Or we might stop right there and I would say,
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.780]   okay, help me see that, how did you get that
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.300]   and what does that mean to you?
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:15.300]   And there's just such a benefit of being able to
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.060]   enter into a great conversation, it is a great benefit.
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.300]   I love it.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.240]   - I will never be able to pass on my Challenge Four books
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.880]   to future Challenge Four tutors in my community,
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.000]   sorry guys, because they are littered with annotations
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.200]   and marginalia of things that Luke has said.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.500]   It's almost like whatever the senior year version
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.860]   of a baby book is, just looking at his thoughts developing,
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.680]   looking at his ideas and it's been great
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.480]   because I have always loved literature
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.920]   and I've always loved reading and he has not.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.360]   So is he going to walk away from this experience
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.940]   loving reading books?
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.540]   I don't know, but I do know that we have learned together
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:08.380]   and we are closer because we're having these experiences.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.380]   So I would say that's a definite benefit
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.060]   to learning alongside of our children.
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.860]   I also think there's a real benefit
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:20.020]   to us learning differently or learning different things
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.400]   than our students are learning.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.420]   - Yes, talk about that.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.000]   - So I think the best example of this
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.860]   is actually advice that I have heard
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:36.300]   my friend Tim give to someone else
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.620]   and it was shared with me anecdotally.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.600]   And he said that one of the best things we can do
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.600]   for our students is to sit and read something for ourself
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.660]   that has nothing to do with school
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:54.020]   and nothing to do with work for 10 to 15 minutes a day.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.160]   That if they see us reading
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:02.600]   and it doesn't have to be high-brow literature.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.100]   It could just be something that you enjoy.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.240]   It will change the dynamic of our home.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.500]   It will make our learning environment more hospitable.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.300]   So I don't think that every parent needs to read
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.160]   every book alongside their student.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.220]   They don't have to learn everything
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.780]   but we do need to learn enough
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.040]   that we can at least ask them the questions
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.680]   to get them in the right direction if they get lost.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   And they would benefit from us modeling for them
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:39.060]   what it looks like to be a lifelong learner.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.960]   And even if that means,
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.140]   "Hey guys, I'm going to a class tonight
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.760]   "so that I can learn more about different sourdough starters
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.700]   "then that will benefit them."
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.160]   They can see that learning is not just for school
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.300]   but it is for life.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.040]   - Yeah, one of the best compliments our kids ever paid us
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.800]   was explaining to one of their friends that,
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.560]   "Oh yeah," 'cause they saw my husband
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.340]   had his Greek New Testament out
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.140]   and he took Greek as a seminary student
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.760]   but hadn't really kept current on his studies.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.020]   And so he had it out brushing up on something
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:21.520]   and so for my daughter just to say,
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.560]   "Oh yeah, my dad is working on that."
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.880]   Or, "Oh yeah, my mom is learning
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.480]   "about medicinal uses of flowers."
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.840]   We learn, that's just what we do.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.400]   Our family just learns.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.400]   And to realize that they had internalized that idea
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:46.360]   that learning is what we do not because we're in school
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.100]   but because we're alive and because we're curious
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.820]   and because we want to keep knowing and growing.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.140]   That's really cool.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.820]   So here's what, 'cause I think we've answered the question,
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.760]   should we keep learning
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.600]   even though we're not in school anymore?
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.320]   But look, would you encourage people,
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.740]   and I think I know the answer to this already,
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.620]   do you think that we need to keep learning
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.020]   even after our kids leave home?
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.360]   I mean, I understand setting the example
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.140]   of reading some every day or working on some new skill
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.760]   so that we are modeling for them and learning with them
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.200]   so that we can be their mentor.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.180]   But what about after they're gone
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.640]   and we're finally empty nesters?
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.840]   - And you finally have time to read.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   - Yes, so how important is it to keep learning
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.560]   when the kids aren't watching anymore?
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   - I think that as humans in the image of God,
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.720]   we need to keep learning about God, about his creation,
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.060]   and about our fellow man.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:03.760]   And so I think that it is incredibly important
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.680]   that we keep learning because it's not just about
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.240]   being a model and a mentor for our children.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.180]   We are called, all Christian men and women are called
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.480]   to be Titus II men and women.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.040]   And we are called to mentor.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.560]   And even though it may not be the season
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.600]   where we have children in our home,
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.240]   God is always gonna put someone in your path
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.880]   that you are a step ahead of them
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   and where you can be someone that fills in a gap for them
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.960]   and mentors them.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.600]   And again, it may not be Shakespeare or Plato.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   It may be the best ways to get a stain out of a shirt.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   And it may be the best ways to manage your time
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.640]   when you're just starting homeschooling.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.480]   There's so many things that we have the opportunity to teach.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.000]   And I think as Christians, we also always have
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.400]   the responsibility of being students of the word
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.920]   and being in the Bible on a regular basis.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.680]   And I have found, I'm someone that fell in love
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.000]   with the word early.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.200]   My early mentors as a young Christian in my teens
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.760]   were passionate about the Bible and Bible study.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.560]   And then my favorite college professors
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.640]   were just so excited about scripture.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.640]   I have found the greatest growth in my study of scripture
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.720]   and my enjoyment of scripture has come as a result
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.960]   of my classical studies.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.440]   I enjoy scripture more because now I understand analogies.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.760]   I under scripture more because now I have
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.400]   a very different understanding of not just genre,
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.440]   which I learned in high school English,
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.880]   but ancient genres.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.360]   So I think as believers, I think we always
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.000]   have to keep learning, always.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.840]   - Yeah, I love that, I love that.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.080]   And you've mentioned, we've talked about scripture
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.560]   and we've talked about a lot of ways that we can,
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.080]   as grownups, educate ourselves.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.920]   We can read along with our students.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:17.120]   We can read academic things and non-academic things.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.400]   We can chase our interests.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.000]   We can pursue a hobby.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.360]   We can find a mentor.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.400]   What are other ways that you have found
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.640]   to educate yourself?
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.640]   - I have surrounded myself with other lifelong learners.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:41.360]   I have collected a group of friends who love nothing more
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.120]   than to talk about what we are learning.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.840]   And again, it's not always highbrow literature
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.960]   or the classics.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.560]   Sometimes it's, look at this cool tip or trick I learned.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.120]   But almost everyone that I've talked to
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:02.840]   but almost everyone that I spend any amount
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:07.840]   of my extracurricular time, which is very limited,
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.640]   almost all of it is spent with people that love to learn.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.720]   And whether they love to learn scripture
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.520]   or they love to travel
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.400]   or they love to just talk about books,
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.040]   they are the people that have educated me.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.600]   We are educating each other.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.520]   So I think that one of the best things you can do
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.680]   is find people to learn alongside.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:35.080]   You can do that in CC by finding a couple of other moms
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   or dads that maybe just wanna read a book together.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.520]   No pressure. - Right, read together.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.920]   Absolutely. - Just read together
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.080]   and be humble enough to say,
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.640]   I have no idea what he just said.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.480]   I don't get it.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.880]   Can you please tell me what you think this means
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.120]   or how can we figure out what he was saying
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.720]   to his original audience?
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.280]   - There are also lots of classical resources
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.520]   where you can continue to educate yourself
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.880]   in a more formal way.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.920]   There are webinars that are done by our friends
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.720]   at CRC and at Classical Academic Press.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.640]   I help run an organization
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.800]   called the New England Consortium of Classical Educators.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.360]   There's lots of groups out there
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:23.360]   where very low cost and very low impact,
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.280]   meaning you don't have to put yourself out there necessarily
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.120]   and be super vulnerable where you can learn.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.680]   So right before we finished,
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.920]   right before we started recording this podcast,
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   I was taking a Latin class with lifelong learners
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.440]   just learning Latin a little bit differently,
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.960]   getting a different layer than what I've had so far
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.440]   as a challenge tutor and challenge parent.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.400]   So I think there's a lot of different ways
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.680]   to educate yourself.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.200]   If you are more of an introvert
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.440]   and you just wanna learn on your own,
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.840]   there are kind of self-directed classes
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.240]   that you can take through many different organizations
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.720]   and you can take them, some of them are for free
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.040]   and some of them are very low cost.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.720]   So finding something you're interested in
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.120]   and finding other people,
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.040]   whether they're online or in person
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.320]   that are also interested that will walk alongside you.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.960]   It's so much easier to do when you have friends
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.840]   because when you get discouraged,
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.960]   they are there to help translate Shakespeare for you
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.880]   or they're there to encourage you
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.600]   or to give you a different recommendation.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.520]   - I always think thoughts when I am in community
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.000]   that I'm pretty sure I would not think on my own
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.520]   because somebody says something that spurs me on
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.440]   to think about something in a way
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.000]   that I've never thought of it.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.080]   From an angle I've never considered it before
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.520]   and it stretches me and every time I'm stretched,
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.960]   I learn a little bit.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.440]   I love the emphasis that you placed on community
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   and how community really does encourage lifelong learners.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.520]   One of the easiest ways to learn things
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.400]   that you never were really interested in before
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.320]   is to surround yourself with people
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.400]   who aren't exactly like you.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.680]   Surround yourself with people
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.560]   who are interested in different things,
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.520]   who've had different experiences
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:31.520]   and that way you learn together to appreciate things
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.920]   that you yourself never came in contact with.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.120]   - And if we are as classical students ourselves,
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.080]   if we're learning how to ask questions well
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.480]   and how to listen well,
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.680]   we are gonna learn so much from those community members
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.120]   because it's no longer about let me ask you this question
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.040]   so I can tell you what I think.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.640]   It's just humbly saying, tell me what you know about this,
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.720]   tell me about what you do for a job,
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.920]   tell me about your hobby, tell me about your trip
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.480]   and just listening and learning from them.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.400]   That is gonna educate you
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.720]   because you're gonna end up with a list of things
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.560]   you've never thought about before, never experienced.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.400]   In our home, in my challenge classes,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.800]   we call it our wonder list.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.720]   They're things that we're curious about learning about
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.080]   or doing someday and we just write them down
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.360]   so that we don't forget and sometimes I'll talk to someone
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.440]   and they'll be like, oh yeah,
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.000]   I did this thing in this place
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.400]   and I've never done that thing
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.960]   and I've never been to that place
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.560]   and so I put them on my list and I just,
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.280]   I read a book about them or I listen to a podcast about it.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.280]   - That is so great.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.280]   That is really great.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:50.280]   I love that that also is a great way
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.720]   to love our neighbor well.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   To be interested in what our neighbor is passionate about
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.080]   is a way to love our neighbor well
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.280]   and to celebrate what God has made of them
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.160]   and what God has placed in their heart.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.800]   And when we can participate with them in that curiosity
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.840]   and in that wonder, we love them well and I love that.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.200]   I love that.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.960]   This has been great, Heatherly.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.400]   I've enjoyed picking your brain
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.280]   about how we can educate ourselves,
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.680]   not just why should we do this,
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.680]   but how and what the pleasures and the benefits are.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.600]   This has been great.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.760]   I have one final question for you and it's not a hard one.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.360]   It is a very personal one
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.840]   that I've started asking all my guests.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   I want to know what makes you an everyday educator?
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:55.440]   - I am an everyday educator because I love to learn
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.720]   and I love to share what I've learned
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:03.040]   and I am constantly asking questions about things
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.920]   so that I can get that next layer.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.080]   I'm constantly looking for the next book to read
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.280]   or the next person to talk to or the next class to take.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:20.320]   And so, because I am, as you said, a curious student,
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.560]   I'm constantly adding to my own copiousness
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.160]   and my own body of knowledge.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.160]   I then become a more interesting teacher
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.040]   and a more interesting teacher to my students,
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.120]   a more interesting teacher to my friends.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:41.880]   I have a varied experience so I can mentor
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.760]   the people that God has brought into my path.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.960]   - I love that.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.200]   I love that, my friend.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.600]   And I look forward to being able to sit down,
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.480]   maybe someday soon, face to face with you.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.040]   I know, that'd be so awesome for us to be able
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.200]   to learn something together or just to talk about
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.880]   what each of us has learned most recently.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.240]   That would be awesome.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.720]   Listeners, I hope that you have enjoyed this
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.320]   as much as I have.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.080]   I want to tell you about one thing
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:17.960]   that you might want to pursue as you are looking
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.560]   for something to talk about with your whole family together.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.760]   I want to tell you about a movie that's coming out
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.280]   at the end of October called Miracle in East Texas.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.200]   It is a very encouraging, heartwarming movie.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.360]   It's about doing what's right and it is a movie
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.280]   that your whole family can enjoy together.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.120]   It's directed by Kevin Sorbo and it tells the true story.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   So this is a true story, a traumatized version
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.080]   of a true story about the biggest oil strike
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.880]   in the history of the world.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.520]   All right, did that get your interest?
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.440]   That happened right at the dawn of the Great Depression
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.000]   and it actually follows the story of two con men
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.040]   who convince investors to invest in what they believe
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:15.600]   is worthless oil rigs which turn out to not be
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.920]   so worthless after all.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.760]   Anyhow, it's coming to a theater near you on October 29th
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.520]   and if you want to find out where or even get tickets now
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.080]   and start looking forward to it with your family,
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.280]   you can visit sorbostudios.com.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   That's S-O-R-B-O studios.com
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.960]   and find out more about Miracle in East Texas.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.840]   Maybe you would be motivated to learn about oil rigs
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.560]   or the Great Depression or about doing what's right,
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.320]   something you can talk about with your whole family.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.040]   So Heatherly, thank you one more time
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.240]   for being with me today and listeners,
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.440]   go and be lifelong learners.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.400]   (gentle music)
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.460]   you
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:18.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
