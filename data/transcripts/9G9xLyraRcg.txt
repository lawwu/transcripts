[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   You already have liberal scholars attacking the veracity, the truthfulness,
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.060]   but also the consistency of the Word of God.
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.760]   So translations are going to be faithful.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.840]   It's imperative that as an unbeliever is reading and they're looking at the history
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.800]   and the background, that there's a match, there's no inconsistency,
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.400]   that we're not so concerned about the so-called believer in today's progressive
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.920]   generation, that we forget that the Word of God is redemptive in its course,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.960]   that it is a gospel message that points to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.920]   And if God is faithful, Christ is faithful, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.960]   then the consistency of the translation must reflect the nature of God,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.600]   for it to be trustworthy.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.720]   And so if there's any confusion in the translation, it can have a negative impact
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.320]   on the unbeliever.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.360]   When you are faithful to the transmission of the scripture,
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.520]   the Spirit of God does his most effective work of the truth.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.520]   and the LSV reflects that once more.
