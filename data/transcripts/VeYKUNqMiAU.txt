[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.300]   I'm anxious that I don't do enough for God.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.180]   This statement arrives every single week in our inbox.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.200]   We hear it all the time.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.640]   In this case, it comes from a young man, a listener to the podcast.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.400]   Thank you, Pastor John, for APJ.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.700]   I am a follower of Jesus, and I just had a question about anxiety and becoming more like
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.940]   Jesus with that anxiety.
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.840]   Sometimes I feel overwhelmed because of what seems like a mounting list of things I must
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.280]   do to become like Jesus.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.340]   I feel stressed out because I want to please God, but it feels like there's so many things
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.340]   to do.
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.240]   Kill sin, grow in fruits of the Spirit, be the best worker I can be, live and pour myself
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.680]   out to my community, my church, pursue people to disciple and mission, live a healthy lifestyle,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.940]   Sabbath properly, and also endure suffering.
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.600]   I know Jesus said in this world we will have trouble, and he has overcome the world, but
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.860]   it just seems like there's so many things I need to do.
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.740]   Do I focus on certain things over others or try to focus a little bit on everything?
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.940]   At the end of the day, all I want to hear is, "Well done, my good and faithful servant."
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.980]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.820]   That's a pretty impressive list of things to do that he gives.
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.820]   It is.
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.820]   Kill sin, grow in the fruits of the Spirit, be the best worker I can be, pour yourself
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.540]   out for your church, pursue people to disciple, live a healthy lifestyle, Sabbath properly,
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.540]   endure suffering.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.540]   Oh my.
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.420]   But I think it will be helpful, even though at first it won't seem helpful, to make sure
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.020]   that this young man sees that the situation is way more burdensome than he thinks it is.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.700]   If he keeps approaching the Christian life a certain way.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.340]   For example, take this list from Ephesians 4.
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.020]   Put away falsehood, speak the truth, be angry, do not sin, do not let the sun go down on
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.080]   your anger, give no opportunity to the devil, don't steal, do honest work, share with everyone
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.140]   in need, let no corrupting talk come out of your mouth, give grace to those who hear,
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.860]   don't grieve the Holy Spirit, put away all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor,
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.260]   be kind to one another, be tenderhearted, be forgiving.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.900]   Or what about this list from Romans 12?
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.360]   Show genuine love, abhor what is evil, hold fast to what is good, outdo one another in
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.420]   showing honor, do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord, rejoice
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.980]   in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer, contribute to the needs of the
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.460]   saints, show hospitality, bless those who persecute you, rejoice with those who rejoice,
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.220]   weep with those who weep, live in harmony with everyone, do not be haughty, associate
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.940]   with the lowly, never be wise in your own sight, repay no one evil for evil, do what's
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.500]   honorable in the sight of all, live peaceably with all, don't avenge yourselves, don't
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.460]   be overcome with evil, overcome evil with good.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:18.020]   These 41 things that we are commanded to do just in two short passages.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.980]   But let me, you think that's heavy.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.980]   Let me make it really heavy.
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.980]   Do you know how many imperatives there are in Paul's letters?
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.540]   13 letters.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.540]   431.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.260]   Do you know how many imperatives there are in the general epistles?
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.260]   128.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.420]   Do you know how many imperatives there are in the gospels?
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.420]   1022.
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.760]   So there you are.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.820]   You want a list to be anxious about?
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.620]   How about 1500 imperatives for your list?
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.420]   So you have to make things worse sometimes in order to see wisdom.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.580]   So what does that mean?
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.300]   What does that mean?
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:05.900]   It means that the Christian life approached a certain way is simply unlivable.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.940]   To be specific, if you are trying to give focused, special attention to each of the
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:22.380]   individual commands of the New Testament, which would be about 1800, you can't do it.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.340]   Not because you're lazy or worldly or sinful, but because you're finite.
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.380]   Your brain is finite.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.620]   Nobody can remember, let alone focus all day long on 1800 duties.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:45.620]   You can't keep that many things in your head, let alone give attention, prayerful effort
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.380]   to each one.
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.380]   So what are we supposed to do?
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.900]   And the answer is not, underline this, the answer is not, "Oh, well, I guess obedience
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.900]   doesn't matter."
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.020]   It's clear.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.020]   Obedience doesn't matter.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.460]   God doesn't care if we keep his commandments.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.220]   Our young friend who wrote this question—didn't tell us what his name was—he's got that
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.520]   right.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   Obedience matters.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.460]   He's right.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.380]   Seeking to please the Lord by doing what honors the Lord matters.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.980]   It's a confirmation of our right standing, our new birth, our authentic faith.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.980]   It matters.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.700]   You don't blow obedience out the window because there are 1800 commands that you can't
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.300]   obey by focusing on them with direct moment-by-moment attention.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.900]   That's not the answer.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:50.220]   So let me make three observations that I think point the way that God wants us to fulfill
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.660]   his words, his commandments.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:00.680]   And I'm assuming that justification by faith alone is behind us, settled.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:07.620]   We have a right standing with God because we have put our faith in Jesus as our redemption
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.540]   and our wisdom and our righteousness.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:17.020]   The effort to bring our lives into conformity to God's imperatives is not an effort to
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.140]   get right with God.
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:26.900]   Our aim is to be conformed to Christ for his glory from being right with God.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.160]   So here's observation number one.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.980]   Each of those two lists that I gave—one from Ephesians 4 and one from Romans 12—interestingly
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:44.940]   and crucially began with the general call for us to be deeply transformed from within
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:53.900]   so that the fruit of our lives grows naturally on the tree of renewal rather than each fruit
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.420]   being pushed out by some intentional effort.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:05.740]   For example, in Romans 12, at the beginning it says, "Be transformed by the renewal
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.900]   of your mind so that you discern what is the will of God, what is good, acceptable, and
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.900]   perfect."
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:23.420]   So, we should give ourselves to being deeply renewed, deeply transformed from within so
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:32.020]   that the discernment of the will of God in a hundred cases comes like fruit on a tree,
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.540]   not like calculated steps through a minefield.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.380]   Same thing in Ephesians 4.22, but I won't take time to read that.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.260]   So that's my first observation.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:49.900]   Think first and foremost in terms of being transformed from within by the Spirit, by
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:57.220]   embracing by faith a new self that God has created and is working in us by the Spirit,
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:05.300]   which then overflows with proper responses in a hundred situations spontaneously.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:13.900]   Observation number two, realize that the New Testament portrays some responses of the soul
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:21.860]   as roots and hundreds of others as fruits of obedience.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.300]   Some acts are root, some are fruit.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.660]   So we should focus on the deepening and the strengthening and the intensifying of roots
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.440]   like faith, hope, and love.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:41.460]   Each one of those in the New Testament is pictured as producing life, the rest of life,
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.660]   the rest of obedience.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.820]   Faith produces the obedience of faith, Paul calls it.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:54.700]   Hundred good fruits come from having a right, restful grasp of the sufficiency of Christ
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.140]   and the promises he's made.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.740]   Hope, same thing, gives rise to behaviors of freedom and love.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:07.300]   Love is described as the sum and source of all other commandment keeping.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:12.300]   Paul puts it like this, "The commandments, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.100]   murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and any other commandment," that's
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.440]   amazing, "any other commandment are summed up in this word, you shall love your neighbor
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   as yourself."
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.760]   And then he adds, "Love does no wrong to a neighbor, therefore love is the fulfilling
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.480]   of the law."
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.480]   Implication?
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:41.360]   So give yourself to the kind of inner spiritual renewal that deepens and intensifies these
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.320]   root virtues of faith and hope and love.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:56.940]   And my last observation is this, Paul did not give us 431 imperatives in his letters
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:03.720]   for us to skip them and ignore them and say that all we need to do is go deep with love
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.840]   and we can just ignore the imperatives and not read the second half of his letter because
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.000]   that'll just turn us into legalists anyway.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.600]   Now that's a mistake that many people make, and it undermines biblical holiness.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.960]   It tries to be wiser than God.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:27.760]   Oh, how many mistakes are made in the church by Christians who think they can be wiser
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:34.260]   than God by drawing inferences from things that he does not draw.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.800]   He gives us these imperatives.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.700]   Those imperatives, 431 of them, are not there by accident.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:51.880]   They are there as signposts for our souls to see how we are doing in the deeper process
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.140]   of transformation.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.140]   They help us.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.080]   They don't get in the way.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:06.120]   And the Holy Spirit uses the specific commands like "show hospitality," "don't use coarse
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:14.900]   language," "flee fornication," and 400 others as litmus tests to see whether our efforts
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:20.340]   at transformation are in fact bearing good fruit.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:30.320]   So my closing word to our young friend is, thank God for your concern with pleasing the
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.720]   Lord and wanting to hear, "Well done, good and faithful servant."
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:41.620]   Thank God that you care about obedience and pleasing the Lord in your behavior.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:49.320]   I don't want you to ignore the specifics of the New Testament, but I do want you to step
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:57.120]   back and realize that a focus on the specifics alone is hopeless.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.560]   There are too many of them.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:06.680]   Let the beauties of Christ and the greatness of his work for you and the spectacular preciousness
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:14.320]   of his promises and the power of the Holy Spirit work a deep work of transformation
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:24.120]   in your life, and then let the focus be on the specifics as a way of gauging the temperature
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.200]   of your transformation.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.800]   Probably wise counsel on living authentically without getting overwhelmed by all the details.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.880]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for listening.
