[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.540]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.060]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.660]   Today, we continue our discussion of the senses,
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.880]   and the senses we are going to discuss
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.500]   are pain and pleasure.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.380]   Pain and pleasure reflect two opposite ends of a continuum,
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.180]   a continuum that involves detection of things in our skin,
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.740]   and the perception, the understanding
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.260]   of what those events are.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.460]   Our skin is our largest sensory organ,
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.620]   and our largest organ indeed.
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.180]   It is much larger than any of the other organs in our body,
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.340]   and it's an odd organ if you think about it.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.160]   It has so many functions.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.380]   It acts as a barrier between our organs
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.180]   and the outside world.
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.580]   It harbors neurons, nerve cells,
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.220]   that allow us to detect things like light touch,
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.860]   or temperature, or pressure of various kinds.
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.860]   And it's an organ that we hang ornaments on.
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.200]   People put earrings in their ears.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.060]   People decorate their skin
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.720]   with tattoos and inks and other things.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.900]   And it's an organ that allows us to experience
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.720]   either great pain or great pleasure.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.800]   So it's a multifaceted organ,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.580]   and it's one that our brain needs to make sense of
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.980]   in a multifaceted way.
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.900]   So today we're going to discuss all that,
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.520]   and most importantly, how you can experience more pleasure
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520]   and less pain by understanding these pathways.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.140]   We will also discuss things you can do,
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.760]   and if you wish, things you can take
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.700]   that will allow you to experience more pleasure
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.180]   and less pain in response
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.980]   to a variety of different experiences.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.300]   Before I go any further,
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.780]   I want to highlight a particularly exciting area of science
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.280]   that relates to the skin
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.580]   and to sensing of pleasure and pain,
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.980]   but has everything to do with motivation.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.520]   Motivation is something that many people struggle with.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.260]   Not everybody, but most people experience dips
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.420]   and peaks in their motivation,
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.340]   even if they really want something.
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.900]   How should we think about these changes in motivation?
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.520]   What do they reflect?
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.120]   Well, at a very basic level,
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.300]   they reflect fluctuations,
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.200]   changes in the levels of a chemical called dopamine.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.420]   Most of us have heard of dopamine.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.300]   Dopamine is a neuromodulator,
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.720]   meaning it modulates or changes the way
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.400]   that neurons, nerve cells work.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.560]   Most of us have heard that dopamine
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.800]   is the molecule of pleasure.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.860]   However, that is incorrect.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.660]   Dopamine is a molecule of motivation and anticipation.
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.740]   To illustrate how dopamine works,
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.180]   I want to highlight some very important work,
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.400]   largely carried out by the laboratory
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.360]   of a guy named Wolfram Schultz.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.400]   The Schultz Laboratory has done dozens
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.060]   of excellent experiments on the dopamine system
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.720]   and have identified something called
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.360]   reward prediction error.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.200]   Although in some sense,
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.080]   you can think about it as reward prediction variance,
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.780]   changes in the levels of dopamine,
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.920]   depending on whether or not you expect a reward
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.660]   and whether or not you get the reward.
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.560]   So I'm going to make this very simple.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.380]   Dopamine is released into the brain and body
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.860]   and generally makes us feel activated and motivated
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.380]   and as if we have energy to pursue a goal.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.800]   And it is released into the brain and body
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.380]   in anticipation of a reward.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.040]   Measurements of dopamine have been made
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.560]   in animals and humans.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.900]   What you find is that when we anticipate a reward,
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.640]   dopamine is released.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.300]   We will put in the work to achieve that reward.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.720]   That work could be mental work or physical work,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.460]   but when the reward arrives,
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.320]   dopamine levels drop back down to baseline.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.160]   That's right.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.200]   When we receive a reward,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.440]   dopamine levels go back down to baseline.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.800]   So the way to envision this,
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.780]   as you can just imagine a sort of increase in dopamine
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.000]   as we anticipate something,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.320]   we're working towards it,
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.640]   we're working towards a goal,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.440]   we're excited about seeing somebody or meeting somebody
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.400]   or receiving some reward,
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.520]   and then the reward comes and dopamine goes down.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.040]   Now that's all fine and good,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.400]   but there is a way to get much more dopamine
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.000]   out of that process
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.120]   and therefore a way to have much more motivation,
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.280]   energy and focus
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.380]   because those are the consequences of elevated dopamine.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.000]   The way to do that is to not deliver the reward
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.080]   on an expected schedule.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.580]   So experiments have been done
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.280]   where there's an anticipation of a reward,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.940]   there's work and then the reward only arrives every other
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.640]   or every third bout of work.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.600]   So this would be like getting a pat on the head
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.920]   if you're a dog or perhaps a child or an adult,
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   or getting a monetary reward only for every third project
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.520]   or every third race that you win.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.360]   Pick any kind of goal, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.600]   These molecules don't care about what you're pursuing.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.720]   They are a common currency of different types of activities.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.160]   That's a regular reward schedule
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.000]   and it will not alter the pattern of dopamine release
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.660]   that I described before.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.420]   However, if the reward arrives intermittently,
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.020]   almost randomly, so you anticipate a reward as a maybe,
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.680]   it might come, it might come.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.900]   Then you work, work, work, work, work, no reward.
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.240]   You repeat the work, work, work, work, work, work
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.260]   and then you get a reward.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.580]   So some trials you do, some trials you don't
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.140]   and it's completely random.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.640]   Under those conditions, the amplitude,
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.560]   the amount of dopamine that's released into your system
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.880]   and the motivation to continue working hard
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.500]   or playing whatever kind of game you're playing,
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.180]   doubles or triples.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.480]   And this is the basis of things
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.920]   like slot machines and gambling.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.680]   And this is why so many people will give so much
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   of their money up to casinos and the casinos always win.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.680]   Sometimes people walk away with more money
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.400]   than they came to the casino with,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.740]   but the vast majority of the time,
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.560]   the house wins, as they say.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.100]   And it's because they understand
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.560]   intermittent reward schedules.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.040]   And you can apply this to stay motivated
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.080]   in your own pursuits.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.480]   Rather than thinking about the pleasure of a reward,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.440]   understand that dopamine is released
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.340]   in response to anticipation of a reward.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.320]   And that is the fuel for work.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.980]   And every once in a while at random, remove the reward.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.080]   That's the way to continue to stay motivated,
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.480]   not to reward every action or every goal.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.120]   And this is also true if you're trying to train up children
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.720]   or train up players on a team,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.260]   you should not celebrate every win.
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.880]   I know that's a little counterintuitive.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.700]   We're going to go more into the biology of dopamine
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.640]   and how it relates to the pleasure system
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.100]   later on in the podcast.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.080]   But for now, understand intermittent reward schedules,
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.180]   harness the biology of dopamine
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.800]   in ways that can allow you
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.440]   essentially infinite motivation over time.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.560]   Before I go any further,
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.200]   I want to acknowledge that this podcast
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.040]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.160]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.520]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.700]   about science and science-related tools
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.160]   to the general public.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.300]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.360]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.320]   Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.820]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.440]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.280]   to help you better understand your body
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.560]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.220]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.880]   for the simple reason that many, if not all of the factors
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.320]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.200]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.440]   And nowadays with the advent of DNA tests,
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.840]   you can get further knowledge into the mechanisms
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.000]   that are going on in your body
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.840]   and how those mechanisms are changing
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.200]   as they relate to metabolism and hormones
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.220]   and other aspects that profoundly impact your wellbeing.
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.180]   The problem with most blood tests, however,
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.660]   is that you get information back
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.120]   and it will tell you whether or not your levels
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.780]   of something are high or low or within range,
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.860]   but it doesn't give you any directives.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.400]   It doesn't tell you what to do with that information.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.460]   With Inside Tracker, it has this wonderful feature.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.720]   It's a very easy to use dashboard
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.120]   that has suggestions about lifestyle factors,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.620]   exercise, nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.700]   that one could take in order to adjust those numbers
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.500]   according to your personal goals.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.940]   So the whole thing is made very easy.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.060]   In fact, they can come to your home
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.760]   to do the blood test and DNA test if you like.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.480]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.900]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.

[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.040]   That's a measure of your biological age
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.860]   according to your DNA and other factors
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.220]   with any purchase from Inside Tracker store.

[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.280]   you can get a free inner age test.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.300]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.100]   Helix makes mattresses and pillows
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.100]   that are ideally suited to your sleep needs.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.160]   Everybody's different.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.540]   Some people sleep on their side.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.700]   Some people sleep on their stomach.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.140]   Some people sleep on their back.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.700]   Some people run warm during the night.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.180]   Some people run cold.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.740]   If you go to the Helix's website,
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.020]   helixsleep.com, you can take a quick two minute quiz
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.620]   and then it will tell you what your ideal mattress is.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.220]   It will match you to your ideal mattress.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.820]   I did this and I matched to the so-called dusk mattress.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.020]   I like a mattress that's not too firm nor too soft.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.740]   I tend to run hot during the night
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.900]   and I tend to sleep on my side or on my stomach.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.740]   I started sleeping on a Helix mattress
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.880]   about nine months ago
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.780]   and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.500]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.920]   to one that's ideally suited to your sleep needs,
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.780]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.180]   take their two minute sleep quiz
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.060]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.980]   and you'll get up to $200 off that mattress order
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.820]   and two free pillows.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.980]   They have a 10 year warranty
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.180]   and you get to try out the mattress
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.660]   for a hundred nights risk-free.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.340]   They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.060]   but I think you really will love it.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.100]   So again, if you're interested,
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.340]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.320]   for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.420]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.080]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.460]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.120]   I started drinking Athletic Greens way back in 2012
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.600]   and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.460]   The reason I started drinking Athletic Greens
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.420]   and the reason why I still drink it once
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.140]   or even twice a day is because it takes care
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.300]   of all my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.780]   It includes vitamins, minerals, and probiotics
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.500]   which are important for the gut microbiome,
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.160]   this colony of bacteria,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.720]   healthy bacteria that we all have living in our guts.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.400]   And when that bacteria is healthy,
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.580]   our brain functions better,
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.960]   our immune system functions better.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.840]   There is now a lot of research to support that.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.600]   Athletic Greens tastes delicious.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.440]   I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.900]   And as I mentioned, I drink it once or twice a day,
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.600]   usually in the morning and again in the afternoon.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.440]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.760]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.080]   and claim a special offer.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.320]   That special offer is a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.340]   There's now a robust literature showing
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.920]   that vitamin D3 is critical for various aspects
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.180]   of our health, metabolic health, endocrine health, et cetera.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.780]   And you'll also get five free travel packs.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.520]   When you travel, mixing up Athletic Greens
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.540]   is made really easy by these little travel packs.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.520]   You just put them in a jar or a water bottle,
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.460]   mix it with water.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.080]   It's very easy to do on a plane or in the car, et cetera.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.820]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.300]   to get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.300]   and the year supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.480]   So let's talk about pleasure and pain.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.360]   I think we all intuitively understand
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.520]   what pleasure and pain are.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.180]   Pleasure generally is a sensation in the body
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.260]   and in the mind that leads us to pursue more
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.460]   of whatever is bringing about that sensation.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:24.460]   And pain is also a sensation in the body and in the mind
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.120]   that in general leads us to want to withdraw
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.840]   or move away from some activity or interaction.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.080]   That's not always the case.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.440]   Some people actively seek out pain.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.380]   Some people somehow can't seem to engage with
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.860]   or experience pleasure.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.080]   But most people operate on this basis of pleasure and pain.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.280]   Scientists would call this a pettative behaviors,
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.680]   meaning behaviors that lead us to create an appetite
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.560]   for more of those behaviors and aversive behaviors,
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.760]   behaviors that make us want to move away from something.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.520]   The simplest example of that would be putting your hand
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.840]   near a hot flame.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.160]   At some point, there would be a reflex
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.720]   or a deep desire to withdraw your hand.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.680]   Tasting something delicious in general
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.080]   makes us want to eat more of that thing.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.000]   Interactions with other people that we find delicious
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.720]   also make us want to interact with those people more.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.280]   None of this is complicated or sophisticated.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.600]   This is simply to illustrate the fact that pleasure and pain
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.680]   tend to evoke opposite responses,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.320]   opposite behavioral responses
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.440]   and opposite emotional responses.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.160]   So how does that come about?
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.080]   Well, it really comes about by an interaction
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.180]   that starts at one end of our body, meaning our skin,
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.920]   and the other end of the organs of our body,
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.640]   which is deep within the brain.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.480]   So let's consider these two ends of the spectrum
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.420]   of pleasure and pain and what they contribute
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.720]   to those experiences of pleasure and pain.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.600]   The organ that we call the skin, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.880]   is the largest organ in our body.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.160]   And throughout that organ, we have neurons,
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.260]   little nerve cells.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.000]   Now, to be really technical about it,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.020]   and the way I'd like you to understand it,
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.220]   is that the so-called cell body,
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.280]   meaning the location of a cell in which the DNA
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.480]   and other goodies, the kind of central factory of the cell,
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.320]   that actually sits right outside your spinal cord.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.140]   So all up and down your spinal cord on either side
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.440]   are these little blobs of neurons,
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.940]   little collections of neurons.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.320]   They have a name, if you'd like to know,
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.340]   for you aficionados or those who are curious,
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.200]   they're called DRGs, dorsal root ganglia.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.160]   A ganglion is just a collection or a clump of cells.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.620]   And those DRGs are really interesting
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.400]   because they send one branch that we call an axon,
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.060]   a little wire, out to our skin,
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.060]   also to our muscles and to our organs.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.500]   But here we're talking about the skin.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.160]   They send a wire out to our skin,
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.260]   and that wire literally reaches up into the skin.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.160]   It's actually in our skin.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.320]   And they have another wire from that same cell body
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.560]   that goes in the opposite direction,
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.520]   which is up to our brain,
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.740]   and creates connections within our brain
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.480]   in the so-called brainstem.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.480]   What this means is that the neuron in your body
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.960]   that we call the DRG that sends a wire, an axon,
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.460]   to sense what's going on in your big toe,
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.180]   and then sends another axon in the opposite direction
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.680]   into the base of your brain.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.860]   That is the largest cell in your entire body of any kind,
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.040]   fat cell, muscle cell, nerve cell, et cetera.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.720]   Those are extremely long cells.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.220]   They can be a meter or more,
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.160]   depending on how tall you happen to be.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.980]   So we have these cells that have wires
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.360]   that go off in two different directions,
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.040]   and the wire that's within our skin
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.400]   will respond to any number of different categories
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.000]   of stimuli, okay?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.980]   These wires are positioned within the skin
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.080]   to respond to mechanical forces, so maybe light touch.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.520]   Some will only send electrical activity
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.440]   up toward the brain in response to light touch,
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.600]   meaning if you press on the skin really hard,
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.760]   they don't respond.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.800]   You stroke the skin lightly with your fingertip or a feather,
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.600]   and they respond very robustly.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.080]   Others respond to course pressure, to hard pressure,
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.240]   but they won't respond to a light feather.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.360]   For instance, others respond to temperature.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.280]   So they will respond to the presence of heat
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.000]   or the presence of cold or changes in heat and cold.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.140]   And still others respond to other types of stimuli,
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.820]   like certain chemicals on our skin.
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.320]   Many of you have probably experienced the sensation
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.140]   of eating a hot pepper.
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.600]   Well, I don't recommend doing this,
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.160]   but were you to take a little slice of jalapeno
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.040]   or other hot pepper, habanero pepper or something like that,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.480]   and rub it on your skin,
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.140]   you would actually feel something at that location.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.120]   And that's because that pepper
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.600]   doesn't just create a sensation within your mouth,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.000]   it will create a similar sensation on your skin.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.320]   So these neurons are amazing.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.320]   They're collecting information of particular kinds
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.840]   from the skin throughout the entire body
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.100]   and sending that information up toward the brain.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.960]   And what's really incredible,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.040]   I just want you to ponder this for a second.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.920]   What's really incredible is that the language
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.820]   that those neurons use is exactly the same.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.300]   The neuron that responds to light touch
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.760]   sends electrical signals up toward the brain.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.220]   The neurons that respond to cold or to heat
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.500]   or to habanero pepper,
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.080]   they only respond to the particular thing
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.840]   that evokes the electrical response.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.900]   I should say that they only respond
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.780]   to the particular stimulus,
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.800]   the pepper, the cold, the heat, et cetera,
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.440]   that will evoke an electrical signal.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.040]   But the electrical signals are a common language
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.340]   that all neurons use.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.080]   And yet if something cold is presented to your skin
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.440]   like an ice cube,
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.360]   even if you don't see that ice cube,
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.720]   if your eyes are closed or someone comes up behind you
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.480]   and puts an ice cube against your bare skinned back,
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.920]   you know that that sensation, that thing is cold.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.000]   You don't misperceive it as heat
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.400]   or as a habanero pepper, okay?
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.340]   So that's amazing.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.640]   What that means is that there must be another element
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.900]   in the equation of what creates pleasure or pain.
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.680]   And that element is your brain.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.440]   Your brain takes these electrical signals
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.740]   and interprets them partially based on experience,
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.620]   but also there are some innate,
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.560]   meaning some hardwired aspects of pain and pleasure sensing
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.880]   that require no experience whatsoever.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.340]   A child doesn't have to fall down,
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.160]   but wants to know on that first fall that hurt.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.160]   They don't have to touch a flame, but once,
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.340]   and the very first time they will withdraw their hand
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.880]   from the flame.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.520]   So no prior experience is required.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.160]   Other things, prior experience is required.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.060]   For instance, if you're somebody that has
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.900]   a intense aversion to spicy foods,
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.400]   that's probably because you've tasted spicy foods before.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.020]   Likewise, if you really like sweet foods,
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.420]   it's probably because you've tasted them before.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.720]   So you can start to make predictions
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.920]   based on prior experience,
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.240]   but the pain and pleasure system
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.560]   don't need prior experience.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.640]   What they need is a brain that can interpret
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.660]   these electrical signals.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.080]   They can take these electrical signals
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.080]   and somehow create what we call pleasure
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.100]   and pain out of them.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.720]   So what parts of the brain?
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.280]   Well, mainly it's the so-called somatosensory cortex,
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.680]   the portion of our neocortex,
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.040]   which is on the outside of our brain,
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.960]   the kind of bumpy part, not kind of,
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.880]   if you have a normally formed brain, it will be bumpy.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.960]   If you have a smooth brain, that's not good.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.700]   Some animals just have a smooth brain.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.020]   Humans have a bumpy brain,
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.580]   which means it has a very large surface area.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.180]   And those bumps are 'cause you squeezed it like a pizza
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.220]   and bunched it all up and put inside the skull.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.060]   So that's good.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.940]   That means you have a lot of neurons.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.260]   And in your somatosensory cortex,
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.640]   you have a map of your entire body surface.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.600]   That map is called a homunculus.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.500]   And if we were to take your cortex and lay it out on a table,
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.340]   I've actually done this with the cortices
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.040]   of various animals and humans included.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   What you would find is that there's literally a map
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.500]   of your entire body surface,
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.960]   but it wouldn't look exactly like you.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.080]   This map would be very distorted.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.320]   Why would it be distorted?
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.660]   Well, certain areas of your body
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.940]   have a much denser innervation as we call it,
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.880]   or put simply many more of the sensory wires
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.260]   from these DRGs within your skin.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.660]   So this map of you that exists in your brain,
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.260]   and you do have one of these on each side of your brain.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.620]   So you have two of these maps, two homunculi.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.460]   That is you.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.340]   It's your representation of touch,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.180]   including pleasure and pain.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.700]   And in that map, your lips are enormous
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.720]   and your back is very, very small.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.400]   And the area around your eyes
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.420]   and the area representing your face is absolutely enormous.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.420]   So you would look like some sort of odd, weird clay doll
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.380]   from some sort of bizarre late night animation thing.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.860]   And just imagine the psychedelic experience
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.640]   of that character of you,
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.460]   and that's what it would look like.
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.520]   But it's not randomly organized.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.200]   To the contrary, it's highly organized
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.060]   in a very particular way,
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.540]   which is that the areas of your skin
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.960]   that have the highest density of these sensory receptors
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.620]   are magnified in your brain.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.700]   So it's sort of like having more pixels in a certain part
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.820]   of a camera than others.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.900]   And in doing that, allowing higher resolution,
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.460]   in this case of touch, not a vision,
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.340]   but of touch sensation in certain parts of your body.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.340]   What are the areas that are magnified?
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.580]   Well, the lips, the face, the tips of the fingers,
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.060]   the feet, and the genitals.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.420]   And so this map of you has very large lips, face,
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.420]   tips of fingers, bottoms of feet, and genitals.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.660]   And that's because the innervation, the number of wires
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.180]   that go into those regions of your body
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:09.300]   far exceeds the number of wires for sensation of touch
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.400]   that go to other areas of your body.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.460]   You can actually experience this in real time right now
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.820]   by doing a simple experiment
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.420]   that we call two-point discrimination.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.980]   Two-point discrimination is your ability
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.380]   to know whether or not two points of pressure
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.880]   are far apart, near each other,
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.220]   or you actually could perceive incorrectly
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.320]   as one point of pressure.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.580]   You might want a second person to do this experiment.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.620]   Here's how you would do it.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.940]   You would close your eyes.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.420]   That person would take two fine points.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.780]   Don't make them too sharp, please.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.760]   So it could be two pencils or pens or the backs of pens.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.160]   Two pens I'm holding in my hands.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.200]   If you're just listening to this, I'm just holding two pens.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.100]   My favorite pens, these Pilot V5s or V7s, which I love.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.160]   If you were to close your eyes
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.560]   and I were to take these two pens
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.720]   and put their points close together about a centimeter apart
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.660]   and present them to the top of your hand,
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.380]   I'm just going to do that now to myself,
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.160]   you, even though your eyes were closed,
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.220]   you would be able to perceive
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.340]   that that was two points of pressure
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.260]   presented simultaneously to the top of your hand.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.880]   However, if I were to do this to the middle of your back,
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.660]   you would not experience them as two points of pressure.
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.060]   You would experience them as one single point of pressure.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.860]   In other words, your two point discrimination is better,
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.860]   is higher on areas of your body,
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.700]   which have many, many more sensory receptors.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.580]   You are more sensitive at those locations.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.020]   Now this makes perfect sense once you experience it
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.420]   or you hear about it.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.020]   However, most of us don't really appreciate how important
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.280]   and what a profound influence this change in density
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.060]   of receptors across our body surface has.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.600]   And we can go a step further and describe another feature
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.780]   of the way that you're built
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.020]   and the way that you experience pleasure and pain,
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.140]   which is called the dermatome.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.740]   The dermatome is literally the way in which your body surface
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.140]   is carved up into different territories,
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.280]   much like a map of the United States
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.900]   is carved up into different territories
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.220]   of states and counties, et cetera.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.020]   The dermatome is the way in which neurons
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.500]   connect to different parts of your body.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.500]   Now you've actually experienced the dermatome before.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.120]   The dermatome is when you have a neuron
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.540]   that connects to a particular area of the body.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.680]   And that neuron doesn't just send one little wire out,
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.940]   like one little line and go up into the skin
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.900]   to detect mechanical or thermal or chemical stimuli.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.760]   It actually sends many branches out like a tree.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.860]   But remember those branches of the tree
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.420]   come from one single neuron.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.760]   Now, occasionally what will happen is you will experience
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.700]   something like cold or heat or pain or tingling
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.640]   on a patch of your body.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   And occasionally that patch of body
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.420]   will actually have a very cleanly demarcated boundary,
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.040]   a very stark boundary with the areas around it.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.540]   A good example of this would be the herpes simplex 1 virus,
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.680]   which if one has this virus,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.660]   and I should mention that somewhere between 80 and 90%
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.120]   of people have this virus.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.100]   This is not a sexually transmitted virus.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.100]   This is a virus that's transmitted very easily
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.240]   between people through various forms of contact,
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.660]   non-sexual contact.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.840]   It's present in children, it's present in adults.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.600]   And most people get it.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.180]   Some get symptoms and some don't.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.080]   Some get recurring symptoms, some don't.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.680]   We can talk about that at the end if you like.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.440]   But this virus lives on what's called
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.140]   the fifth cranial nerve, also called the trigeminal nerve.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:40.540]   The trigeminal nerve sends branches out to the lips,
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.060]   to the eyes and to certain portions of the face.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.080]   So for those of you listening,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.800]   I've just kind of put my right hand across my face
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.240]   and to sort of simulate the three branches,
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.500]   the trigeminal aspect of this nerve.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.160]   So try three.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.880]   Now, when the herpes virus flares up, as they say,
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.920]   in response to stress or other factors,
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.560]   the virus inflames that nerve
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.920]   and people experience tingling and pain on the nerve.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.200]   Sometimes they'll get a cold sore or a blister
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.840]   on their lip or near their mouth.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.620]   Sometimes they'll get a collection of those.
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.840]   And that's because that dermatome is actually inflamed.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.720]   Now, other people will experience something like shingles.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.660]   It's a fairly common viral infection.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.840]   And what they'll notice is they'll get a rash
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.860]   that has a boundary.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.280]   It's like, they'll get a bunch of bumps,
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.200]   sometimes blisters, and it'll have a sharp boundary.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.000]   That boundary exists because the virus exists on the nerve.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.200]   And so it actually is boundaried with the neighboring area
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.720]   of the body that's receiving input from another nerve.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.160]   And that one doesn't have the virus living on it.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.160]   So anytime you see a rash or a pattern on the body surface,
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.680]   on the skin, that has a pretty stark boundary,
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.320]   chances are that's an event that's impacting the dermatome.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.720]   I've experienced this before,
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.080]   not through herpes simplex,
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.600]   but through the experience of having a lot of blood
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.860]   sort of aggregating in a kind of a segment
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.040]   across the front of my face.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.880]   It was really bizarre.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.700]   I looked in the mirror and I thought,
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.540]   what is going on here?
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.400]   I was having an allergic reaction to something I'd eaten.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.480]   And that allergic reaction clearly was affecting
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.800]   one of the nerves and therefore the dermatome.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.160]   And what it showed up was,
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.900]   it was almost like someone had drawn lines on my face
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.100]   that said, okay, this rash or this reaction rather
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.460]   can happen here, but not in the region right next to it.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.560]   Whenever you see that,
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.260]   chances are it's a reaction of the nerves of the dermatome.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.060]   So you'll start to see these things more and more
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.700]   when you start to look for them.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.340]   You don't always have to have a viral infection
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.180]   to experience this.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.100]   Sometimes you'll just experience tingling
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.980]   or even a pleasant sensation,
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.300]   and it will be restricted in kind of a strict boundary
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.460]   on one location of your body surface and not another,
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.580]   not corresponding to an organ like, okay, this arm
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.600]   or just your feet or something like that,
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.700]   but just a segment.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.020]   It's almost like someone outlined a particular area
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.180]   of your body surface.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.500]   That's the dermatome.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.520]   Okay, so you've got sensors in the skin
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.660]   and you've got a brain that's going to interpret
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.980]   what's going on with those sensors.
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.120]   In fact, we can take an example of a sudden rash
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.740]   or inflammation at one location in the dermatome
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.100]   and we can ask, what would make it hurt?
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.920]   What would make it worse?
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.940]   What would make it go away?
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.180]   And believe it or not, your subjective interpretation
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.660]   of what's happening has a profound influence
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.020]   on your experience of pleasure or pain.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.140]   There are several things that can impact these experiences,
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.820]   but the main categories are expectation.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.860]   So sort of whether or not you thought or could expect
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.600]   that this thing was going to happen, right?
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.500]   If someone tells you this is going to hurt,
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.220]   I'm going to give you an injection right here.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.540]   It might hurt for a second.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.500]   That's very different and your experience of that pain
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.440]   will be very different than if it happened suddenly
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.900]   out of the blue.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.740]   There's also anxiety, how anxious or how high
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.260]   or low your level of arousal, autonomic arousal.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.540]   That's going to impact your experience of pleasure or pain.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.820]   How well you slept and where you are
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.520]   in the so-called circadian or 24-hour cycle.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.360]   Our ability to tolerate pain changes dramatically
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.140]   across the 24-hour cycle.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.420]   And as you can imagine, it's during the daylight
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.740]   waking hours that we are better able to tolerate.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.000]   We are more resilient to pain
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.940]   and we are better able to experience pleasure.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.940]   At night, our threshold for pain is much lower.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.960]   In other words, the amount of mechanical or chemical
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.940]   or thermal, meaning temperature stimulated
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.380]   that can evoke a pain response
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.380]   and how we would rate that response is much lower at night.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:57.340]   And in particular, in the hours between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.100]   if you're on a kind of standard circadian schedule.
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.800]   And then the last one is our genes.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.160]   Pain threshold and how long a pain response lasts
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.460]   is in part dictated by our genes.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.500]   And later I'm going to discuss this myth
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.160]   or whether or not it's really a myth
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.280]   as to whether or not certain people in particular redheads,
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.900]   people who have red pigmented hair and fair skin,
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.940]   whether or not their pain thresholds differ.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.460]   And to just give you a little sneak peek into that,
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.580]   indeed they do and it's because of a genetic difference
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.120]   in a particular gene and a particular pattern of receptors
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.300]   in the skin that are related
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.100]   to the pigmentation of hair and skin.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.400]   So we have expectation, anxiety, how well we've slept,
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.260]   where we are in the so-called 24 hour circadian time
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.840]   and our genes.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.620]   So let's talk about expectation and anxiety
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.860]   because those two factors can powerfully modulate
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.160]   our experience of both pleasure and pain
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.160]   in ways that will allow us to dial up pleasure if we like
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.300]   and to dial down pain if indeed that's what we want to do.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.820]   So let's talk about expectation and anxiety
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.180]   because those two things are somewhat tethered.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.420]   There are now a number of solid experiments
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.700]   both in animal models and in humans that point to the fact
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.500]   that if we know a painful stimulus is coming,
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.440]   that we can better prepare for it mentally
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:30.420]   and therefore buffer or reduce the pain response.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:35.120]   However, the timing in which that anticipation occurs
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.580]   is vital for this to happen.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.000]   And if that timing isn't quite right,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.580]   it actually can make the experience of pain far worse.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.740]   So here I'm summarizing a large amount of literature,
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.460]   but essentially if subjects are warned
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.800]   that a painful stimulus is coming,
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   their subjective experience of that pain is vastly reduced.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.200]   However, if they are warned just two seconds
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.480]   before that pain arrives, it does not help.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.100]   It actually makes it worse.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.280]   And the reason is they can't do anything mentally
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.240]   to prepare for it in that brief two second window.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.860]   Similarly, if they are warned about pain that's coming
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.640]   two minutes before a painful stimulus is coming,
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.500]   electric shock or a poke or cold stimulus
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.740]   or heat stimulus that's pretty extreme,
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.660]   that also makes it worse because their expectation ramps up
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.820]   the autonomic arousal, the level of alertness
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.180]   is all funneled toward that negative experience
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.640]   that's coming.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   So how soon before a painful stimulus
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.940]   should we know about it if the goal
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.900]   is to reduce our level of pain?
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.660]   And the answer is somewhere between 20 seconds
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.040]   and 40 seconds is about right.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.660]   Now I'm averaging across a number of different studies,
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.700]   but if you have about 20 seconds or 40 seconds
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.100]   advance warning that something bad is coming,
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.220]   you can prepare yourself for that.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.580]   But the preparation itself and the arousal
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.040]   that comes with it, the kind of leaning in,
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.440]   okay, I'm either going to relax myself
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.780]   or I'm going to really kind of dig my heels in
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.720]   and kind of meet the pain head on,
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.620]   that seems to be the optimal window.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.360]   This can come in useful in a variety of contexts,
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.320]   but I think it's important because what it illustrates
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.420]   is that it absolutely cannot be just the pattern of signals
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.560]   that are arriving from the skin, from these DRGs,
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.520]   these neurons that connect to skin
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.840]   that dictates our experience of pain or pleasure.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.440]   There has to be a subjective interpretation component.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.980]   And indeed that's the case.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:46.300]   So let's talk about the range of pain experiences.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.120]   And from that, we will understand better
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.620]   what the range of pleasure experiences are
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.020]   that different people have,
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.060]   because we are all different in terms of our pain threshold.
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.180]   First of all, what is pain threshold?
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.360]   Pain threshold has two dimensions.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.560]   The first dimension is the amount of mechanical
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.500]   or chemical or thermal stimulation that it takes
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.180]   for you or me or somebody else to say,
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.580]   I can't take that anymore, I'm done.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.160]   But there's another element as well,
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.100]   which is how long the pain persists.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.340]   I'll just describe myself, for example,
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.120]   I don't consider myself somebody
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.500]   who has a particularly high pain threshold.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.200]   I don't think it's particularly low either,
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.620]   but I wouldn't consider myself somebody
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.260]   that has a particularly high pain threshold.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.940]   When I stub my toe against the corner of the bed,
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.820]   it absolutely hurts.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.000]   But one thing that I've noticed
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.020]   is that I have very sharp inflections,
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:39.620]   very high inflections in my perception of pain,
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.420]   and then they go away quickly.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.140]   I don't know if that's adaptive or not, it's probably not.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.380]   But my experience of pain is very intense, but very brief.
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.260]   Other people experience pain
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.660]   in a much kind of slower rising, but longer lasting manner.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.700]   And to just really point out how varied we all are
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.660]   in terms of our experience of pain,
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.860]   let's look to an experiment.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.280]   There have been experiments done
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.180]   at Stanford School of Medicine and elsewhere,
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.460]   which involved having subjects put their hand
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.860]   into a very cold vat of water
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.420]   and measuring the amount of time
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.300]   that they kept their hand in that water.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.940]   And then they would tell the experimenter, very quietly,
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.940]   how painful that particular stimulus was
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.300]   on a scale of one to 10,
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.800]   so-called Likert scale for you aficionados.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.340]   That simple experiment revealed
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:32.420]   that people experience the same thermal,
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.420]   in this case cold, stimulus, vastly different.
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:40.260]   Some people would rate it as a 10 out of 10, extreme pain.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.980]   Other people would rate it as barely painful at all,
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.860]   like a one.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:44.980]   Other people, a three.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.340]   Other people, a five, et cetera.
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.280]   Now what's interesting is that the same thing is true
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.540]   for experience of a hot painful stimulus,
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:56.860]   120 degree hot plate where you have to put your hand on it.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.740]   And then at some point you remove your hand.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.140]   Some people are able to keep their hand
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.700]   on there the whole time.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.480]   But people rate that experience as very painful,
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.780]   a little bit painful, or moderately painful,
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.080]   depending on who they are.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.740]   Now that's interesting.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.360]   Probably not that surprising, however.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.100]   But what is very interesting is that
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.680]   when the same experiment was done on medical doctors
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.640]   or medical doctors in training,
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.520]   they too, of course, experienced pain
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.200]   through a range of subjective experiences.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.940]   Some of them, just like any other person off the street,
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.760]   said a particular stimulus of a particular temperature
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   was very painful.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.040]   Others said it wasn't painful at all.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.440]   And some said it was moderately painful.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.600]   And that turns out to be vitally important
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.100]   for the treatment of pain.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.820]   Because pain is not an event in the skin.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.200]   Pain is a subjective emotional experience.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.240]   You may have heard that we have a particular category
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.400]   of these DRGs that innervate the skin,
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.360]   which are called nociceptors.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.040]   Nociceptor comes from the word nocera, I believe it is,
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.640]   which means to harm.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.120]   However, nociceptors don't carry information about pain.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.000]   They carry information about particular types of stimuli
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.520]   impacting the skin.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.120]   And then the brain assigns a value, a valence to it,
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.620]   a label, and says that's painful.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.040]   And where people draw the line
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.400]   between not painful and painful varies.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.200]   Now, because physicians are people
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.600]   and because physicians treat pain,
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.720]   what we know from a lot of data now
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.940]   is that if someone comes into the clinic
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.960]   and says they're experiencing chronic pain
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.560]   or whole body pain or acute pain after an injury
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.280]   or one location, it doesn't really matter what the cause is,
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.160]   or even if there's a cause at all,
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:46.560]   how the doctor reacts to that report of the patient's pain
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.480]   will dictate in many cases the course of treatment.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.600]   And of course, doctors, their goal is to treat the patient
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.720]   according to the patient's needs, not their own.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.980]   And that's what good doctors do.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.120]   However, it's been found,
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.080]   and I think now there is work being done
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.280]   to try and change this,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.540]   but if a doctor has a very high threshold for pain,
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.240]   their interpretation of somebody else's report of pain
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.260]   is going to be different.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.640]   They might not discount the patient, right?
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.080]   This doesn't necessarily mean that they think,
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.720]   oh, this person, you know, their pain is irrelevant.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.840]   Probably not.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.540]   In fact, from having a high threshold for pain,
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.360]   if someone comes in and says, I'm in extreme pain,
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.160]   that doctor probably thinks, wow,
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.200]   this has to be really, really extreme,
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.780]   but they can be talking about two different experiences.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.400]   Similarly, if a physician has a very low threshold for pain
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.620]   and someone comes in and says,
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.180]   you know, I'm, yeah, I'm experiencing some pain in my back.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.420]   I've got the sciatica thing, but it, you know, it's, yeah,
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.820]   it's a little bit uncomfortable.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.540]   It's like a, I don't know, like a four out of 10.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.660]   Well, that physician might interpret that four out of 10
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.040]   as a pretty extreme sense of pain
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.180]   or a pretty extreme experience of pain.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.440]   And so you can start to see
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.700]   how the subjective nature of pain
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.740]   can start to have real impact on the treatment of pain
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.720]   because treatment of pain is carried out by physicians.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.920]   In fact, there is no objective measure of pain.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.780]   We can ask how long somebody can keep their hand
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.800]   on a hot plate or in a cold bath.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.600]   You can do various experiments.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.440]   They even have some extreme experiments
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.160]   where they'll shave a portion of the leg
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.780]   and they'll put on a very painful chemical compound
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.480]   and see how long people can tolerate that.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.420]   These are very uncomfortable experiments as you can imagine.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.100]   But in general, we don't have a way of measuring
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.040]   somebody else's subjective experience of pain.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.760]   There's no blood pressure measure.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.020]   There's no heart rate beats per minute measure of pain.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.400]   So one of the great efforts of neuroscience and of medicine
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.000]   is to try and come up with more objective measures of pain.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.220]   Similarly, pleasure is something that we all talk about.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.260]   Ooh, that feels so good, or I love that,
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.020]   or more of that, please, or less of that.
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.360]   But we have no way of gauging
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.820]   what other people are experiencing
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.900]   except what they report through language.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.980]   And so this is really just to illustrate
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.660]   that this whole thing around pain isn't a black box.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.860]   We do have an understanding of the elements.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.700]   There are elements in the skin.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.840]   There's elements of the brain.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.540]   There's expectation, anxiety, sleep, and genes,
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.400]   but that it is very complicated.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.260]   And yet there are certain principles
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.720]   that fall out of that complicated picture
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.460]   that can allow us to better understand and navigate
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.520]   this axis that we call the pleasure pain axis.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.800]   So rather than focus on just the subjective nature of pain,
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.240]   let's talk about the absolute qualities of pain
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.080]   and the absolute qualities of pleasure
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.640]   so that we can learn how to navigate those two experiences
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.000]   in ways that serve us each better.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.760]   First of all, I want to talk about heat and cold.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.480]   We do indeed have sensors in our skin
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.480]   that respond to heat and cold.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.040]   And for any of you that have entered a cold shower
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.920]   or a cold body of water of any kind or ice bath, et cetera,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.180]   you will realize that getting into cold
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:03.200]   is much harder if you do it slowly.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.900]   Now, despite that, people tend to do it very slowly.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.320]   I have noticed an enormous variation
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.400]   with which people can embrace the experience of cold.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.400]   I noticed it because I do some work with athletes
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.600]   and I do some work with military
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.480]   and I do some work with the general public.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.920]   And one of the best tests of how somebody can handle pain
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.180]   is to ask them to just get into an ice bath.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.960]   It's not a very sophisticated experience,
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.280]   but it really gets into the core of the kind of circuitry
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.200]   that we're talking about, both in the skin and in the brain.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:39.820]   Some people, regardless of sex, regardless of age,
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.860]   and regardless of physical ability,
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.740]   can just get into the cold.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.800]   They're somehow able to do it.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   Now, I don't know what their experience of the cold is
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.520]   and neither do you, you only know your experience,
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.360]   but they're able to do that.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.960]   Some do it quickly, some do it slowly.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.560]   Others find the experience of cold to be so aversive
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.760]   that they somehow cannot get themselves in.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.460]   They start quaking, they start complaining,
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.820]   and many of them just simply get out.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.660]   They can't do it.
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.840]   Some don't even get in past their knees.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.040]   This isn't necessarily about pain threshold,
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.500]   but it's related to that.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.040]   I think it can be helpful to everyone to know
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.400]   that even though it feels better at a mental level
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.240]   to get into the cold slowly and people ask,
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.640]   oh, I just want to get in slowly, I want to take my time,
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.920]   it is actually much worse
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.280]   from a neurobiological perspective.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.840]   The neurons that sense cold respond
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.260]   to what are called relative drops in temperature.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.780]   So it's not about the absolute temperature of the water.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:43.480]   It's about the relative change in temperature.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.240]   So as you move from a particular temperature,
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.320]   whether or not it's in the air next to an ice bath
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   or cold shower, or from a body of water that's warm
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.120]   to a body of water that's colder,
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.140]   or sometimes in the ocean, you'll notice it's warm.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.640]   And then as you swim out further,
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.300]   you'll get into a pocket of water where it's much colder.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.320]   That's when the cold receptors in your skin start firing
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.760]   and sending signals up to your brain.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.640]   Therefore, you can bypass these signals
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.200]   going up to the brain with each relative change,
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.580]   one degree change, two degrees change, et cetera,
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.080]   by simply getting in all at once.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.200]   In fact, it is true.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.900]   And maybe you've been told this before,
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.480]   and it is true that if you get into cold water
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.320]   up to your neck, it's actually much more comfortable
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.360]   than if you're halfway in and halfway out.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.760]   And that's because of the difference in the signals
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.920]   that are being sent from the cold receptors
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.880]   on your upper torso,
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.960]   which is out of the water in your lower torso.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.580]   Now, I wouldn't want anyone to take this to mean
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.800]   that they should just jump into an unknown body of water.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.900]   There are all sorts of factors like currents.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.280]   And if it's very, very cold, yes, indeed,
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.260]   you can stop the heart.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.440]   People can have heart attacks
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.520]   from getting into extremely cold water,
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:53.520]   like a melted mountain stream that's been frozen all winter
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.460]   or has been very, very cold or has a snowpack going into it.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.580]   If it's very cold, you can indeed have a heart attack.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.040]   So please be smart about how cold
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.920]   and what bodies of cold water
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.600]   you happen to put yourself into.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.120]   But it is absolutely true that provided it's safe,
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.180]   getting into a cold water is always going to be easier
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.360]   to do quickly and is going to be easier
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.020]   to do up to your neck.
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.960]   In fact, you actually want to get your shoulders submerged.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.660]   There are a number of other things you can do.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.360]   If you really want, and it's safe to do,
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.800]   you can put your face under
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.780]   and activate the so-called dive reflex,
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.960]   which also makes the tolerance of cold easier,
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.960]   believe it or not.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.160]   So it's very counterintuitive.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.280]   It's like getting into cold water faster
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.400]   and more completely, you will experience
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.680]   as less uncomfortable, less cold.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.320]   And indeed that's the case.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.580]   And that's because these cold receptors
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.820]   are measuring every relative drop in temperature.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.340]   So every single one is graded, as we say in biology,
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.760]   it's not absolute.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.220]   As an additional point,
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.060]   if you're sitting in a body of cold water
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.340]   and it's not circulating,
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.060]   you'll notice that you start to warm up a little bit,
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.460]   or even if you feel like you're freezing cold,
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.820]   if you move and that water around you moves, of course,
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.880]   then you'll notice it's got even colder.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.460]   And that's because there's a thermal layer.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.220]   You're actually heating up the water
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.780]   that surrounds your body like a halo
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.840]   around every aspect of your body,
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.740]   a sort of silhouette of you of heat
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.060]   where you're heating that water.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.780]   When you move, you disrupt that thermal layer.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.060]   Now, heat is the opposite.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.260]   Heat and the heat receptors in your skin
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.820]   respond to absolute changes in temperature.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.940]   And this is probably because our body and our brain
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.620]   can tolerate drops in temperature much better
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.540]   than it can tolerate increases in temperature safely.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:40.220]   So when you move from say a standard outdoor environment,
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.420]   I mean, here in the States we measure
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.660]   in terms of Fahrenheit,
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.300]   so maybe it's a 75 or an 80 degree or even 90 degree day,
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.740]   and you get into a 100 degree sauna,
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.660]   or if you're in a cool air conditioned building
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.300]   and you go outside and it's very warm outside,
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.860]   you sort of feel like the heat hits you all at once.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.380]   Boom, hits you all at once,
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.700]   kind of like a slap in the face.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.620]   But then it will just stay at that level.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.460]   Your body will acclimate to that particular temperature.
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.340]   However, if that temperature is very, very high,
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.100]   you'll notice that your experience of that heat
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.600]   and your experience of kind of pain and discomfort
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.220]   and your desire to get out of that heat will tend to persist.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.620]   You don't really adapt in the same way.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.700]   And certain people who are really good at handling
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.580]   very hot sauna get better at this.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.100]   You learn to calm your breathing, et cetera,
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.180]   lower your autonomic arousal.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.900]   Obviously you don't want to let your body temperature
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.620]   go too high because if neurons cook, they die.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.660]   If neurons die, they don't come back and that's bad.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.340]   Many people unfortunately harm themselves with hyperthermia.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.860]   Everyone has a different threshold for this,
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.580]   but in general,
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.620]   you don't want your body temperature to go up too high.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.460]   That's why a fever of like 103 starts to become worrisome.
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.940]   104, you really get concerned if it goes, you know,
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.460]   up into that range or higher,
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.620]   that's when you need to really cool down the body
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.020]   or get to the hospital so they can cool you down.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:02.400]   Heat is measured in absolute terms by the neurons.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.620]   So gradually moving into heat makes sense
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.860]   and finding that threshold,
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.000]   which is safe and comfortable for you,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.300]   or if it's uncomfortable at least resides
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.680]   within that realm of safety.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:14.980]   So that's heat and cold.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:17.220]   And those are sort of non-negotiables.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.620]   You can try and lower your level of arousal.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.020]   In fact, many people who will get into a cold shower
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.920]   and ice bath, I think the recommendation that I always give
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.900]   is that you have two possible approaches to that.
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.580]   You can either try and relax yourself,
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.560]   kind of just stay calm within the cold,
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.760]   or you can lean into it.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:37.800]   You can actually take mental steps
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.720]   to generate more adrenaline
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.920]   to kind of meet the demands of that cold.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.640]   And at some point we'll do a whole episode
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.760]   on how to use cold and heat to certain advantages.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.560]   We've done a little bit of this in past episodes,
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.020]   using the cold to supercharge human performance
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.240]   and things of that sort.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:58.040]   But in general, cold is measured in relative terms
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.760]   and therefore getting in all at once is a good idea
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.100]   provided you can do it safely.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.760]   And heat is measured in absolute levels
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.660]   by your brain and body.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.100]   And therefore you want to actually move into it gradually.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.360]   So it's the kind of the inverse of what you might think.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.660]   One of the most important things to understand
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.100]   about the experience of pain
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:19.640]   and to really illustrate just how subjective pain really is
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.060]   is that our experience of pain
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.520]   and the degree of damage to our body
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.960]   are not always correlated.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.360]   And in fact, sometimes can be in opposite directions.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.780]   A good example of this would be x-rays.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:33.360]   We all occasionally get x-rays,
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.040]   at least in the US we get x-rays
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.840]   when we go to the dentist from time to time.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.240]   And the occasional x-ray might be safe
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.240]   depending on who you are,
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.400]   provided you're not pregnant, et cetera.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.760]   I've gone to the dentist,
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.600]   they put you in the chair,
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.720]   they cover you with a lead blanket,
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.800]   and then they run behind the screen to protect themselves
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.160]   and they beam you with the x-rays
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.800]   to get a picture of your teeth and your jaws
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.540]   and your skull, et cetera.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.280]   Well, if you were to get too many x-rays,
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.360]   you could severely damage the tissues of your body,
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.760]   but you don't experience any pain during the x-ray itself.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:09.980]   In contrast, you can think that your body is damaged
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.760]   and experience extreme pain,
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.720]   and yet your body can have no damage.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.840]   A classic example of this was published
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   in the British Journal of Medicine
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.080]   in which a construction worker fell from,
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.440]   I think it was a second story which he was working,
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.980]   and a nail went up and through his boot.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.020]   And he looked down and he saw the nail
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.520]   going through his boot,
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.820]   and he was in absolute excruciating pain.
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:42.880]   They took him to the hospital,
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.880]   and because the nail was so long
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.660]   and because of where it had entered and exited the boot,
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:52.160]   they had to cut away the boot in order to get to the nail.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.240]   And when they did that,
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.080]   they revealed that the nail had passed
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.840]   between two of his toes.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:01.840]   It had actually failed to impale his body in any way.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.880]   And yet the view, the perception of that nail
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.920]   entering his boot at one end
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.460]   and exiting the boot at the other
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:12.360]   was sufficient to create the experience of a nail
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.320]   that had gone through his foot.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.040]   And the moment he realized
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.740]   that that nail had not gone through his foot,
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.760]   the pain completely evaporated.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.980]   And this has been demonstrated numerous times.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.560]   People that work in emergency rooms
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.000]   actually see variations on this, not always that extreme,
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.520]   but many times what we see
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.700]   and how we perceive that wound or that event
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.560]   has a profound influence on how we experience pain.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.720]   And I mention this not just because
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.160]   it's a kind of sensational and fantastic example
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.580]   of this extreme subjective nature of pain,
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:46.280]   but also because it brings us back to this element,
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.520]   which is we don't know how other people feel,
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.680]   not just about pain, but about pleasure.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.500]   We think we do.
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.440]   We have some general sense of whether or not an event
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.780]   ought to be painful or pleasurable,
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.960]   but actually we barely understand how we feel,
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.660]   let alone how other people feel.
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:07.260]   And we can be badly wrong about how we feel,
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:11.020]   meaning we can misinterpret our own sense of pain
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.800]   or our own sense of pleasure
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.400]   depending on what we see with our eyes
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.340]   and what we hear with our ears.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.800]   So we hear a scream, like a shrill scream,
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.840]   and we think it must be pain.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.880]   And if we look at something that's happening to somebody
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:28.460]   and it fits a prior category or a prior representation
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.140]   of what we would consider painful stimulus,
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:34.200]   well, then we think that they're in extreme pain,
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.600]   but actually they might not be in pain at all.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.280]   Now, this highly subjective nature of pain
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.600]   and the way in which we use our visual system
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.040]   to interpret other people's pain and our own pain
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.840]   has actually been leveraged
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.880]   to treat a very extreme form of chronic pain.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.120]   And it's an absolutely fascinating area
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.640]   of biology and neuroscience.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.200]   And it's one that we can actually all leverage
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.000]   toward reducing our own levels of pain
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.400]   whenever we are injured,
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.580]   or believe it or not, even in chronic pain.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.120]   To describe this area of science
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.840]   requires a kind of extreme example,
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.400]   but I want to be clear that even if you don't suffer
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.520]   from this extreme example,
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.160]   there's relevance and a tool to extract for you.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.880]   The extreme example is that of an amputated digit,
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.680]   meaning one of your fingers or your toes,
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.980]   or of an amputated limb.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:30.980]   So people that have digits or limbs that are gone,
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:34.800]   missing from an injury or surgical removal,
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.800]   will often have the experience that it's still there,
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.100]   the so-called phantom limb phenomenon.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.720]   Now, why would that be?
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.980]   Well, when you remove a particular finger or limb,
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:50.200]   obviously that finger and limb is gone,
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.600]   and the dorsal root ganglion neuron
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.640]   that would normally send a wire
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.140]   out to that particular region of the body,
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.420]   that wire is no longer there
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.820]   because that portion of the body is no longer there.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.500]   And in some cases, those neurons die,
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.840]   almost always, but not always.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.600]   However, the map, your so-called homunculus,
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.300]   your representation of yourself in the brain
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:13.340]   is still there.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:17.640]   And this map, the so-called homunculus map
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.500]   that you have and that I have is very plastic.
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:21.600]   It can change.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.840]   And so as a consequence,
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.680]   areas of the map that are adjacent to one another
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.300]   can actually start to invade other areas of the map.
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:34.840]   So for instance, there are neuroimaging studies
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.400]   that have documented that somebody that has, say,
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.800]   a complete removal of their left arm,
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.320]   the representation of their left arm
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.880]   still exists in the cortex.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.960]   And experimentally, if one is to stimulate
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.180]   that area of the cortex, that person,
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:53.620]   and if that person were you,
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:55.900]   would experience having that arm,
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:59.060]   that it were being stimulated, even though it's not there.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.920]   Now, someone who has an amputated arm
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.280]   doesn't need to have their brain stimulated
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.960]   in order to have the experience
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.920]   of that phantom limb being present.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.840]   In fact, many people who have limbs that were amputated
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.600]   feel as if that limb is still present,
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.520]   even though obviously it's not.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.120]   And no matter how many times they look to the stump
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.820]   and just see a stump, somehow it doesn't reorganize
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.060]   that homunculus so-called central brain map.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.560]   Now, that would be fine.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.880]   You might even think that would be better,
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.920]   better to think you have the arm there
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.200]   than to feel as if it's missing.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.880]   And yet many people who have amputated limbs
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.180]   report phantom limb pain.
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.400]   They don't feel that the arm
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.500]   is just casually draped next to them.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.520]   They feel as if it's bunched up and it's an extreme pain.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:49.440]   In fact, this kind of contorted stance
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.940]   that I'm taking right here in my chair
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:53.240]   is not unlike the way that these patients describe this.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.240]   They feel as if it's kind of cramped up.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.600]   It's very uncomfortable for them.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.360]   Now, an absolutely creative,
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.280]   and you could even say genius scientists
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:07.660]   by the name of Ramachandran, that's actually his last name.
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.940]   His complete name is a little bit more complicated.
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.680]   So you all almost always hear Ramachandran
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.560]   referred to as Ramachandran or VS Ramachandran
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:20.560]   because his full name is Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:23.320]   So a lot of letters in there, a lot of vowels.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.960]   But Ramachandran is a neuroscientist.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.320]   He was actually a colleague of mine
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.920]   when my lab was formerly
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.000]   at the University of California, San Diego.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.720]   He's done a lot of work on this phantom limb phenomenon.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:37.460]   And Ramachandran actually started off as a vision scientist.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.560]   And he understood the power of the visual system
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:44.480]   in dictating our experience of things like pain and pleasure.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.440]   And so what he developed was a very low technology
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:52.020]   yet neuroscientifically sophisticated treatment
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.800]   for phantom limb.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.240]   It consisted of a box, literally a box
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.440]   that had mirrors inside of it.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:03.320]   And the patient would put the intact hand or limb
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.000]   into one side.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.300]   And obviously they couldn't put the amputated limb
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:08.140]   into the other side,
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.520]   but because of the configuration of the mirrors,
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:14.020]   it appeared as though they had two symmetric limbs
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.440]   inside the box.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.420]   And then he would have them look at that limb
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:20.220]   and move it around.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.600]   And as they would do this,
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:25.080]   they would report real-time movement,
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.480]   or I should say real-time perception of movement
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.120]   in the phantom limb.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.400]   Now, this is absolutely incredible,
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.720]   but it makes total sense
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.960]   when you think about the so-called top-down
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.440]   or contextual modulation of our sensory experience.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.960]   Remember, it's anticipation, it's anxiety,
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.240]   it's interpretation of what's happening
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.360]   that drives our perception of what's happening.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.680]   And so as he would have these patients
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:52.160]   move their intact limb to a more relaxed position,
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.480]   the patients would feel as if the phantom limb
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.120]   were relaxing.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:59.120]   And this was used successfully to treat phantom limb pain
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.000]   in a number of different people.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.200]   It didn't always work.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.120]   And you can imagine sometimes it might be a little trickier
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:04.960]   like for a leg,
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.960]   although there have been leg boxes
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:11.480]   that have been developed and arranged for this purpose.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.980]   And what was remarkable
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.680]   is that they could finish these experiments
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.640]   and have the patient, the person,
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.480]   enter a state of relaxation,
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:21.240]   reduce the pain in the phantom limb,
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.280]   and it would stay there,
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:25.980]   even though, of course, as they exited the mirror box,
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:27.360]   they would go about their life
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.600]   and use their intact limb for its various purposes.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.640]   I love this experiment because it really speaks
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.480]   to the subjective nature of pain and pleasure.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.500]   It speaks to the power of the visual system,
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.560]   like what we see,
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.220]   just like the nail-through-the-boot experiment,
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:44.340]   what we see profoundly impacts our experience
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.120]   of pleasure and pain, in this case, pain.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:52.040]   Now, there's another aspect to the phantom limb experience
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.740]   and of these maps, the so-called homunculus maps
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:57.840]   in the cortex that Ramachandran worked on,
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.480]   which is very interesting
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.860]   and reveals the degree to which these maps are plastic
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:06.400]   or can change in response to experience.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.520]   Turns out that because of the locations
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.860]   of different body part representations within these maps,
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.280]   certain parts of our body
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.880]   that normally we don't think of as related
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.000]   can start to create merged experiences.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.220]   What do I mean by that?
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:27.400]   Well, Ramachandran described a patient
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:31.120]   who had a somewhat odd experience
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.160]   of having lost their foot.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.760]   So they actually had their foot amputated
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.340]   about midway up the Achilles,
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:41.080]   so lower portion of the calf and foot.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.240]   I don't recall what the reason was for having it removed.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.960]   And fortunately for this patient,
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:50.240]   they did not experience pain in that portion of their body,
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.240]   but rather they confided in him
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:56.780]   that whenever they would have sex,
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:01.160]   they would experience their orgasm in their phantom foot
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.780]   in addition to in their genitals, of course.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:07.220]   And Ramachandran understood the homunculus map
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.660]   and he understood that this was because
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:12.800]   the representation of the foot within the homunculus
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.720]   actually lies adjacent to
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.140]   and is somewhat interdigitated with,
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:20.020]   it actually kind of merges with
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:22.020]   the representation of the genitalia.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.440]   Now, that's a weird situation.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:30.920]   And yet you now know that the density of innervation
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.680]   of the feet and the genitalia,
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.260]   as well as the lips and the face,
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:37.840]   are actually the highest sensory innervation
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.600]   that you have in your entire body.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.480]   And this speaks to, I think,
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.480]   a more important general principle for all people
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.800]   of the experience of pleasure or pain,
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:50.160]   which is that an aspect of our pain or pleasure
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.680]   can be highly localized, right?
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.840]   It can be because of a cut to a particular location
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:58.940]   on the body, or it can be because, excuse me,
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.760]   of a fall injury or a kind of bruise
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.080]   on one side of our body.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.940]   And yet our experience of pleasure and pain
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:11.160]   can also be an almost body-wide experience.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.800]   And yet it's always most rich,
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.400]   it's always most heightened in these regions of our body
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.140]   that have dense sensory innervation.
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.900]   So we experience pain and pleasure
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.760]   according to local phenomenon, receptors in the skin
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.960]   and this homunculus map
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   that has all these different territories.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.900]   But because of the way that those territories are related,
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.440]   this kind of wild example of somebody experiencing orgasm
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.620]   in their phantom foot speaks to the larger experience,
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.540]   the more typical, rather, experience that I should say,
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.120]   that all people have,
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.120]   which is that pleasure can be body-wide,
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.520]   or we can experience it in our face,
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.100]   the bottoms of our feet and other areas of the body
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.360]   that we experience pleasure.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.080]   And similarly with pain.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.220]   And that brings us to the topic of whole body pain,
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.880]   not just localized pain,
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.420]   as well as whole body pleasure, not just localized pleasure.
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:05.160]   There are a number of examples of whole body pain
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.360]   that people suffer from.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.760]   And one common one is called fibromyalgia.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.240]   I want to just first share with you
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.120]   a little bit of medical insight.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.000]   A few months back, I did an Instagram Live
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.940]   with Dr. Sean Mackey, who's an MD, medical doctor,
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:23.640]   and a PhD at Stanford School of Medicine.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.180]   That was recorded and placed on my Instagram.
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.440]   If you want to check it out,
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.140]   we can provide a link to that in the show notes.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:34.060]   Dr. Mackey is the chief of the division of pain
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.900]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.280]   So he's a scientist, he studies pain,
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.380]   and he treats patients dealing with various forms of pain,
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:45.200]   whole body pain like fibromyalgia, acute pain, et cetera.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.120]   And he shared with me something very interesting,
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:52.120]   which is that anytime you hear or see the word syndrome,
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.680]   that means that the medical establishment
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.560]   does not understand what's going on.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.920]   A syndrome is a constellation of symptoms
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.200]   that point in a particular direction
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.820]   or some general set of directions
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.480]   about what could be going on,
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:10.480]   but it doesn't reveal a true underlying disease necessarily.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.840]   It could be a aggregate of diseases,
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.320]   or it could be something else entirely.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.660]   And I want to make sure that I emphasize
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.360]   the so-called psychosomatic phenomenon.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.560]   I think sometimes we hear psychosomatic
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.580]   and we interpret that as meaning all in one's head,
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.360]   but I think it's important to remember
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.560]   that everything is neural,
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.360]   whether or not it's pain in your body
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.640]   'cause you have a gaping wound
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.600]   and you're hemorrhaging out of that wound,
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.120]   or whether or not it's pain for which you cannot explain it
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.640]   on the basis of any kind of injury, it's all neural.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.920]   So saying body, brain, or psychosomatic,
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.320]   it's kind of irrelevant,
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.680]   and I hope someday we move past that language.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.100]   Psychosomatic is interesting.
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:57.200]   There was a paper that was published in 2015,
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.480]   and then again in 2020, a different paper
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.760]   focused on the so-called psychogenic fevers
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.000]   or psychosomatic effects.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.380]   I just briefly want to mention this
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.660]   because it relates back to pain.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.760]   These studies have shown that there are areas
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.000]   of the so-called thalamus,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.720]   which integrates and filters sensory information
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.200]   of different kinds,
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:21.460]   and within the brainstem, an area called the DMH,
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:24.020]   and I can also provide a link to this study if you like,
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:28.080]   that shows that there is a true neurological basis.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.220]   There are brain areas and circuits
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.920]   that are related to what's called psychogenic fever.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.420]   When we are stressed,
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.580]   and in particular, if we think that we were injured
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.780]   or that we were infected by something,
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.060]   we can actually generate a true fever.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.220]   It is not an imagined fever.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.880]   It is our thinking generating an increase
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.620]   in body temperature.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.600]   And so this has been called psychosomatic,
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.260]   it's been called psychogenic,
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.740]   but it has a neural basis, okay?
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:59.100]   So when we hear syndrome
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.420]   and a patient comes into a clinic
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.660]   and says that they suffer, for instance,
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.120]   from something which is very controversial, frankly,
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.700]   like chronic fatigue syndrome,
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:10.020]   some physicians believe that it reflects
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:13.820]   a real underlying medical condition, others don't.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:18.180]   However, syndrome means we don't understand,
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.260]   and that doesn't mean something doesn't exist.
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.300]   Fibromyalgia or whole body pain for a long time
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.580]   was written off or kind of explained away
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.920]   by physicians and scientists, frankly,
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.340]   my community, as one of these syndromes.
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.480]   It couldn't be explained.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.720]   However, now there is what I would consider,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.840]   and I think others would and should consider,
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.060]   firm understanding of at least one of the bases
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:46.860]   for this whole body pain.
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:51.860]   And that's activation of a particular cell type called glia.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.740]   And there's a receptor on these glia,
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.700]   for those of you that want to know,
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.060]   called the toll-4 receptor.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:00.200]   And activation of the toll-4 receptor
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.020]   is related to certain forms of whole body pain
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.920]   and fibromyalgia.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.440]   Now, what treatments exist for fibromyalgia?
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.740]   And even if you don't suffer from fibromyalgia,
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.140]   and even if you don't know anyone who does,
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:14.440]   this is important information,
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.660]   because what I'm about to tell you
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:20.660]   relates to how you and your body, which is you, of course,
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:23.060]   can deal with pain of any kind.
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:26.520]   And there are actually things that one can do and take
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.540]   that can encourage nerve health in general,
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.740]   in other conditions like diabetic neuropathy,
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.100]   but in all individuals.
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:39.100]   So there are clinical data using a prescription drug.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.520]   This is work that actually was done
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.900]   by Dr. Mackey and colleagues.
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.340]   The drug is called naltrexone.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.480]   Naltrexone is actually used for the treatment
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.740]   of various opioid addictions and things of that sort.
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:54.460]   But it turns out that a very low dose,
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:58.760]   I believe it was a 1/10 the size of the typical dose
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:03.320]   of naltrexone, has been shown to have some success
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:06.620]   in dealing with and treating certain forms of fibromyalgia.
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:09.480]   And it has that success because of its ability
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.160]   to bind to and block these TOL4 receptors on glia.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.180]   Okay, so this so-called syndrome,
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.020]   or this thing that previously was called a syndrome,
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:21.180]   fibromyalgia, actually has a biological basis.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.620]   It was not just in patients' heads.
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.540]   And I really tip my hat to the medical establishment,
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.420]   including Dr. Mackey and others,
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:32.020]   who explored the potential underlying biologies
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.220]   of things like fibromyalgia,
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.980]   and they're starting to arrive at treatments.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.040]   Now, I'm not a physician, I'm a professor,
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.560]   so I'm not prescribing anything.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.940]   You should talk to your doctor, of course,
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:43.120]   if you have fibromyalgia or other forms of chronic
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.460]   or whole body pain to explore whether or not
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.820]   these low dose naltrexone treatments are right for you.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.600]   But I think it's a beautiful case study, if you will,
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.300]   not a case study of an individual patient,
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:58.300]   but a case in study of linking up the patient's self-report
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.740]   of these experiences and using science
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:03.460]   to trying to establish clinical treatments.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.800]   There's another treatment, or I should say,
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.720]   there's another approach that one could take.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.180]   And again, I'm not recommending people do this necessarily.
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:12.260]   You have to determine what's right and safe for you.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.420]   I cannot do that.
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.940]   There's no way, your situation's very far too much,
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:18.260]   and it would be outside of my wheelhouse
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:19.680]   to prescribe anything.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.820]   But there's a particular compound,
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.140]   which in the United States is sold over the counter,
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.700]   and in Europe is prescription.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.940]   It's one that I've talked about on this podcast before
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.940]   for other purposes, and that compound is acetyll-carnitine.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.980]   Acetyll-carnitine, as I mentioned,
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.500]   is by prescription in most countries in Europe.
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.220]   In the US, you can buy this over the counter.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.180]   There is evidence that acetyll-carnitine
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.900]   can reduce the symptoms of chronic whole body pain
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.940]   and other certain forms of acute pain
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.100]   at dosages of somewhere between one to three
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.440]   and sometimes four grams per day.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.020]   Now, acetyll-carnitine can be taken orally.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.740]   It's found in 500 milligram capsules,
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.260]   as well as by injection.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.620]   By injection in the States, in the United States that is,
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.320]   also requires a prescription,
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.900]   or requires a prescription, I should say.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.220]   The over the counter forms are generally capsules
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.500]   or powders.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.580]   Those apparently do not require a prescription.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.460]   There are several studies exploring acetyll-carnitine
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:23.940]   in this context, as well as for diabetic neuropathy.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.860]   And what's interesting about acetyll-carnitine
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:30.020]   is it's one of the few compounds that isn't just used
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.620]   for the treatment of pain,
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:34.180]   but has also been shown in certain contexts
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:37.760]   to improve peripheral nerve health generally.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.460]   And for that reason, it's an interesting compound.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:43.660]   I've also talked about acetyll-carnitine on here previously
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.820]   because it has robust effects on things like
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:49.460]   sperm motility and health,
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.920]   including the speeds at which sperm swim,
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.000]   how straight they swim.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.440]   Turns out that swimming for sperm is more efficient
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.420]   if they swim straight, as opposed to like those,
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.420]   you know, like those kids on the swim team,
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.080]   they're like banging up against the lane lines
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.180]   and zigzagging all over the place.
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:10.680]   So it does turn out to be the case that the quickest route
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.880]   between any two places is a straight line.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.440]   And the good sperm know that,
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.440]   and the less good sperm don't seem to know that.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.740]   And acetyll-carnitine seems to facilitate
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.540]   straight swimming trajectories,
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:23.140]   as well as speed of swimming and overall sperm health.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.740]   And there is evidence from quality peer-reviewed studies
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.460]   showing that acetyll-carnitine supplementation
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:32.260]   can also be beneficial for women's fertility
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.460]   in ways that it affects perhaps,
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.580]   we don't really know the mechanism,
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.740]   health and status of the egg or egg implantation.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.180]   There are a large number of studies on acetyll-carnitine.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.660]   You can look those up on PubMed, if you like,
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:46.660]   or on examine.com.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:49.180]   There are some studies that I don't think are included there
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.380]   which are particularly interesting.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.340]   One that I just would like to reference.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:58.140]   The last name of the first author is Mahdavi,
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:01.260]   so M-A-H-D-A-V-I.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.540]   The title of the paper is
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.780]   effects of L-carnitine supplementation
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.020]   on serum inflammatory markers
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.740]   and matrix metalloprotease enzymes
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:12.100]   in females with knee osteoarthritis.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.860]   So this is a randomized, double-blind,
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.540]   placebo-controlled pilot study
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.680]   that showed really interesting effects
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.420]   of short-term supplementation of acetyll-carnitine.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.200]   Longer term, the effects were less impressive.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.180]   So it's pretty interesting that this compound
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.220]   has so many different effects.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.340]   How could it have these effects?
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.360]   Well, it appears that it's having these effects
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:35.040]   through its impact on the so-called inflammatory cytokines.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.000]   Inflammatory cytokines, for those of you that don't know,
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.720]   are secreted by the immune system
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.060]   in response to different stressors,
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:44.660]   physical stressors, mental stressors too,
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.740]   food that you eat that isn't good for you.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.520]   The so-called hidden sugars, yes,
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.240]   will increase inflammation if they're ingested too often
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.720]   or in amounts that are too high in quantity.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.920]   Things like interleukin-1 beta,
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.720]   things like C-reactive protein,
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.240]   things like interleukin-6.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.240]   Interleukin-6 is kind of the generic inflammatory marker
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.480]   that all studies refer to.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.460]   And yet there are other interleukins.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.920]   Please note that there are other interleukins
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.400]   like interleukin-10 that are anti-inflammatory.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.520]   So your immune system can secrete inflammatory molecules
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.720]   to deal with wounds and stress and things.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.920]   And in the short term, that's good.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.600]   And in the long term, that's bad.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.600]   And it can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:30.660]   And these matrix metalloproteases, it's kind of a mouthful,
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:33.000]   but these matrix metalloproteases are very interesting.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.360]   Anytime you see ACE, that's generally an enzyme,
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.840]   which means that these compounds, in this case,
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.960]   these matrix metalloproteases are used to break down
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:48.480]   certain elements around wounds and scarring,
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.760]   which might sound like a bad thing,
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:53.140]   but in some cases is good because it allows certain cells,
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:55.040]   like glial cells, so-called microglia,
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.520]   to come in like little ambulances,
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.360]   like little paramedics, and clean up wounds.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.580]   So scarring and inflammation is kind of a double-edged sword.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:05.100]   It can be good, but too much scarring,
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.820]   if it contains a wound too much,
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.000]   doesn't allow the infiltration of cell types
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.720]   to move in and take care of that wound and heal it up.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.200]   So it appears that L-carnitine is impacting
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.040]   a number of different processes, both to impact pain
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.160]   and perhaps, and I want to underscore perhaps,
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.240]   but there are good studies happening now,
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:25.640]   perhaps accelerate wound healing as well.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.200]   As long as we're talking about acute pain and chronic pain
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.000]   and supplementation and non-prescription drugs,
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.760]   at least in the United States, that people can take
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.940]   to deal with pain of various kinds,
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.880]   I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the two
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.680]   that I get asked most often about, which are Agmatine
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:45.680]   and S-adenosylmethionine, which is sometimes called SAMe.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:50.340]   Both of those have been shown to have some impact,
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:54.480]   categorized on examine as notable impact
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.160]   on various forms of pain due to osteoarthritis
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.800]   or due to injury of various kinds
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.120]   in different subject population, men, women,
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.320]   people of different ages, et cetera.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.660]   SAMe in particular has been interesting
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:10.880]   because it's been shown head-to-head with drugs
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.300]   like naproxen and other drugs of that sort,
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:17.820]   which are well established and sold over the counter
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:20.980]   in the US to work at least as well
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.980]   as some of those compounds at certain dosages.
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.020]   But it's also been shown that SAMe
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:29.220]   and some of those things take more time
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.500]   in order to have those effects.
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.580]   In fact, head-to-head with things like naproxen
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:37.060]   have been shown that they can take up to a month
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:39.260]   in order to have the pain relieving effect.
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.940]   Now, whether or not that makes them a better choice
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:43.620]   or a worse choice really depends on your circumstances.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.300]   I'm certainly not recommending that anybody take anything,
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:48.900]   but I do think it's interesting and important to point out
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.340]   that things like agmatine, things like SAMe
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:54.040]   have been shown under certain circumstances
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.600]   to be beneficial for pain
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.980]   and they are outside the realm of prescription drugs.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:00.220]   And I think this is a growing area of,
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.300]   some people call them supplements,
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:03.460]   some people call them nutraceuticals.
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:04.400]   Look, at the end of the day,
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.920]   these are compounds that affect cellular processes
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.900]   and the more that we understand
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.980]   how they affect those cellular processes
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.060]   as we now do for things like acetyl-L-carnitine,
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.420]   I think the more trust that we can put into them
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:19.100]   or the more to which we might want to avoid them
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.700]   because of some of the side effects or contraindications
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.320]   that those compounds could have.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.680]   If you're interested in those other compounds,
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.760]   I do invite you, as I always do, to check out examine.com,
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.400]   but also to do your research on those compounds
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.020]   by simply putting them into Google
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:35.340]   or putting them into PubMed, which would be even better.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.180]   And if you are going to go into PubMed,
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.120]   if you're going to start playing scientist,
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.220]   which I do encourage you to do,
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.580]   I would encourage you to not just read abstracts,
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.820]   but if you can, if the studies are freely available,
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.040]   I realize not all of them are freely available,
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.220]   to try and read those studies,
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:51.660]   at least to the extent that you can.
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:54.020]   There's a particularly nice study that you might look at
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.420]   that was published in 2010 in Pain Medicine,
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:01.420]   which is K-Nan et al., K-E-Y-N-A-N,
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:03.300]   which looked at the safety and efficacy
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.460]   of dietary-agmentine sulfate
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:10.400]   on lumbar disc-associated radiculopathy.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.880]   I'm not laughing at the condition.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.880]   It's a painful condition that describes,
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.420]   it's kind of a range of symptoms
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:20.160]   that relate to pinching of nerves.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.120]   The spinal columns, I was laughing at my pronunciation of it.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.520]   That particular study is quite good.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.520]   And the conclusion of that study that they drew
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.520]   was that there were limited side effects
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.680]   and that dietary-agmentine sulfate
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.620]   is safe and efficacious for treating and alleviating pain
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:40.840]   and improving quality of life in lumbar disc-associated pain.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.840]   However, there were very specific dosage regimens, excuse me,
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.220]   that were described there and duration of treatment.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.360]   And so you should not take anything that I say
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.460]   or that study to mean that you can just take this stuff
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.980]   willy-nilly or at any concentration, of course, or dose.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:59.280]   You always want to pay attention to what the science says.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.000]   That paper, fortunately, is freely available online
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.220]   and we will also provide a link to that study.
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:06.460]   For those of you that are interested in SAM-E
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:10.140]   and its usage for the treatment of various types of pain
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.840]   and perhaps other benefits,
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.860]   a number of companies have stopped making SAM-E.
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.280]   Instead, what they're now focusing on
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.180]   is what they think is a better
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.700]   or more bioavailable alternative,
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:27.700]   which is 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate or 5-MTHF.
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:33.520]   This molecule is necessary for converting homocysteine
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.280]   to methionine, which is then converted to SAM-E.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.560]   So rather than taking SAM-E directly,
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.640]   the idea is to take something that's upstream of SAM-E
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.540]   and make more SAM-E endogenously available.
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:47.960]   This is a different strategy.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.840]   I've talked about this strategy before
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:53.240]   for increasing other things like growth hormone, et cetera.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.400]   There's always this question of whether or not
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.920]   in trying to increase the amount
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.560]   of a particular molecule in the body,
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.440]   whether or not taking that specific molecule
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:03.600]   is the best thing or working further upstream
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:07.240]   as it's referred to, working on the precursor
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.040]   or increasing the levels of the precursor
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.240]   is the better way to go.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:16.100]   It appears that this 5-MTHF is the strategy
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.240]   that people are now taking
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:21.180]   in place of taking SAM-E directly.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.360]   So in other words, they're taking this
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.400]   in order to get elevated levels of SAM-E.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.780]   Now I'd like to turn our attention
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:31.540]   to a completely non-drug, non-supplement related approach
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:33.060]   to dealing with pain.
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:36.920]   And it's one that has existed for thousands of years.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:41.140]   And that only recently has the Western scientific community
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:43.780]   started to pay serious attention to,
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.800]   but they have started to pay serious attention to it.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.980]   And there is terrific mechanistic science
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   to now explain how and why acupuncture can work very well
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.060]   for the treatment of certain forms of pain.
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:01.560]   Now, first off, I want to tell you what was told to me
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.440]   by our director or chief of the pain division
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey,
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:11.740]   which was that some people respond very well to acupuncture
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.540]   and others do not.
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:17.440]   And the challenge is identifying who will respond well
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.720]   and who won't respond well.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.240]   Now, when I say won't respond well,
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.800]   that doesn't necessarily mean that they responded
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.460]   in a negative way, that it was bad for them.
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:29.860]   But it does appear that a fraction of people
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.980]   experience tremendous pain relief from acupuncture
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.860]   and others experience none at all or very little
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.360]   to the point where they have to seek out
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.640]   other forms of treatment.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.620]   The science on this is still ongoing.
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:44.760]   There's actually an excellent paper published on this
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.020]   in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:50.580]   one of the premier medical clinical journals.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:52.740]   And it basically reinforced the idea
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:55.200]   that you have responders and non-responders.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.000]   A number of laboratories have started to explore
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.220]   how acupuncture works.
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.700]   And one of the premier laboratories for this
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:07.720]   is Chufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.440]   Chufu has spent many years studying the pain system
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.920]   and a system that's related to the pain system,
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.580]   which is the system that controls our sensation of itch.
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:21.180]   Just as a brief aside about itch,
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:25.440]   itch and pain are often co-associated with one another.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.620]   I was recently in Texas and I will tell you,
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.960]   they have some mean mosquitoes.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.540]   They're small, but whatever they're injecting
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.700]   into your skin, well, here I am talking now
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:36.140]   about my subjective experience of pain.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:39.380]   Whatever they injected into my skin felt to me
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:43.140]   like the most extreme mosquito bites I've ever had.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:44.780]   Not while they were biting me,
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.160]   not while they were injecting the venom,
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.580]   but boy, do those Texan mosquitoes make me itch.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:51.420]   How do they do it?
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:55.500]   Well, their venom creates little packets
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:58.400]   of so-called histamine that travel around.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:01.040]   Those packets are called mast cells,
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.340]   little packets of histamine that go to that location
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.580]   and make me, and presumably you,
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.820]   want to scratch those mosquito bites.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.040]   I scratch mine, you scratch yours,
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.980]   but we both scratch our mosquito bites.
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:13.140]   And when we do that, the histamines are released,
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:16.460]   it gets red and inflamed and they itch even worse.
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:19.180]   The inflammation is actually caused by the histamine.
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:24.180]   Well, that experience of inflammation and pain and itch
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:30.020]   is what we call a pre-rogenic experience, okay?
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:33.660]   So we have pain, which is nociception, essentially.
[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:36.220]   I know that the pain aficionados always get a little upset
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.520]   'cause they say, oh, there's no such thing
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.700]   as a pain receptor.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.100]   It's nociceptive receptors
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:41.740]   and pain is subjective experience.
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:44.800]   Yes, I acknowledge all that, but for fluency,
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.520]   let's just think about pain as a certain experience
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.060]   and itch as a separate experience,
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:50.420]   but they often exist together
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:54.860]   because those mosquito bites were what I would call painful,
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:55.900]   or at least not pleasant.
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:58.380]   They didn't just itch, they were also painful.
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:01.740]   And that's because itch brings with it inflammation
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:04.780]   and inflammation often brings with it pain relief,
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:07.660]   but it can also bring with it the sensation of pain.
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:10.620]   So itch and pain are two separate phenomenon.
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:12.420]   It was actually discovered
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:14.300]   through a really interesting phenomenon
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:16.640]   that relates to something that is actually consumed
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.440]   in supplement form, which is this tropical legume.
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.640]   It's actually a bean called mucuna purines.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:28.640]   That's M-U-C-U-N-A, that's one word, P-R-U-I-E-N-S.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.420]   Mucuna purines is a bean.
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:37.260]   It's this legume that this bean is 99% L-DOPA.
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:40.020]   It's dopamine, or rather it's the precursor to dopamine.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.400]   And people buy this stuff and take it over the counter
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.640]   as ways to increase their levels of dopamine.
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.820]   It does make you feel really dopamine doubt.
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.620]   I mean, it makes you feel a little high
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.360]   and really motivated and really energetic,
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:55.100]   a lot like other drugs that will do that.
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.780]   I don't necessarily recommend taking mucuna purines.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.980]   I personally don't like taking it.
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:01.140]   It doesn't make me feel good.
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:03.840]   I crash really hard when I take it.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.860]   But on the outside of this bean is a compound
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:10.500]   that makes people itch, okay?
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.620]   So they remove this when you take it in supplement form.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:14.540]   In fact, it's usually in capsule form.
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:18.020]   But the outside of this bean, it's like a hairy bean, right?
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:21.360]   And those little hairs contain a compound
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.940]   which was actually used to study
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:27.060]   and identify these itch receptors in the skin.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:30.020]   So we don't have time to go into all the details of itch,
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.380]   but it's pretty interesting that you have these compounds
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:33.980]   out in nature that can make us itch.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.520]   Inside them, they have dopamine.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.500]   I mean, this is really weird,
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.860]   but plant compounds are really powerful.
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:40.940]   So don't let anyone tell you that
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.820]   because something's from a plant or an herb
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:44.340]   that it's not powerful.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:47.420]   There are very powerful plant and herb compounds.
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.180]   Mucuna purines being one of them with dopamine on the inside
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.240]   and itchy stuff on the outside.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.580]   Now, what does this all have to do with acupuncture?
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:58.720]   Well, Chufu Ma's lab has not just identified
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.940]   the itch pathway, these puridogens as they're called,
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:04.900]   which cause itch and the purigenic phenomenon
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.180]   of itch being separate from pain.
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:12.180]   His lab has also studied how acupuncture causes relief of,
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:16.060]   but also can exacerbate pain.
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.040]   Now, the form of acupuncture that they explored
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.660]   was one that's commonly in use called electroacupuncture.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:23.060]   So this isn't just putting little needles
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.940]   into different parts of the body.
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:28.700]   These needles are able to pass an electrical current,
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.460]   not magically, but because they have a little wire
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:32.740]   going back to a device and you can pass electrical current.
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:33.900]   Here's what they found.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:36.020]   There's a public, this is a study, excuse me,
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.300]   published in the journal Neuron, cell press journal,
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.460]   excellent journal, very high stringency.
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:42.740]   So what Chufu Ma's lab found was that
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:47.060]   if electroacupuncture is provided to the abdomen,
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:51.660]   to the stomach area, it creates activation
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.380]   of what are called the sympathetic ganglia.
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.020]   These have nothing to do with sympathy
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:58.300]   in the emotional sense, has to do with the stress response.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:23:59.580]   Simpa just means together.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:02.580]   So it activated a bunch of neurons along the spinal cord
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:08.380]   and the activation of these neurons involves noradrenaline
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.960]   and something called NPY, neuropeptide Y.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.580]   The long and short of it is that stimulating the abdomen
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:20.580]   with electroacupuncture was either anti-inflammatory
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:22.600]   or it could cause inflammation.
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.660]   It could actually exacerbate inflammation
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:28.780]   depending on whether or not it was of low or high intensity.
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.980]   Now that makes it a very precarious technique
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:33.340]   and this may speak to some of the reason
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:36.280]   why some people report relief from acupuncture
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.740]   and others do not.
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.660]   However, they went a step further
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:42.020]   and stimulated other areas of the body
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.220]   using electroacupuncture.
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:46.060]   And what they found is that stimulation of the legs,
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:47.900]   of the hind limbs as it's called in animals
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:51.340]   and the legs in humans caused a circuit,
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:55.120]   a neural circuit to be activated that goes from the legs
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.500]   up to an area of the base of the brain called the DMV,
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.280]   not the DMH, which I mentioned earlier,
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.340]   but the DMV, like you go to the DMV,
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:06.220]   which is a miserable experience for most people,
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:09.280]   forgive me, DMV employees, but let's be honest,
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:13.120]   most people don't enjoy going to the DMV as patrons,
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.980]   but we have to, so we go.
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:19.420]   The DMV and low intensity stimulation,
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:22.100]   this electroacupuncture of the hind limbs,
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:25.800]   activated the DMV and activated the adrenal glands,
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.860]   which sit atop your kidneys
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:31.820]   and cause the release of what are called catecholamines.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:35.300]   And those were strongly anti-inflammatory.
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:39.900]   In other words, electroacupuncture of the legs and feet
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:43.060]   can if done correctly be anti-inflammatory
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.100]   and reduce symptoms of pain.
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.380]   And can we think accelerate wound healing
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:51.860]   because activations of these catecholaminergic pathways
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.100]   can accelerate wound healing as well.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.700]   So the takeaway from this is that
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.980]   while there are thousands of years
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:02.100]   and millions of subjects involved in
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:06.180]   explorations of electroacupuncture and acupuncture,
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:08.980]   Western medicine is starting to come into this
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.020]   and start to explore underlying mechanism.
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:13.260]   Now, for those of you that love acupuncture
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:17.060]   and are real proponents of it, it's worked for you.
[01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:19.260]   You might say, well, why does Western medicine
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:20.300]   even need to come into this?
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.340]   Why should they even be exploring this?
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.360]   But we should all be relieved that they are
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.840]   because what's starting to happen now
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.500]   is that as the mechanistic basis for this
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:33.900]   is starting to come to light, insurance coverage
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:38.100]   of things like acupuncture is starting to emerge as well.
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.340]   And this is in contrast to other therapies
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:42.980]   for which there's a lot of anecdotal evidence
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:45.140]   but very little mechanistic understanding.
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.600]   One example of that would be laser photobiomodulation,
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.360]   the use of lasers of different types really
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.660]   to treat pain and to accelerate wound healing.
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:57.540]   A lot of people claim that this can really help them.
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:00.480]   However, most places, at least in the States,
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.760]   won't cover this with insurance
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.540]   or don't perform this in standard clinics.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:08.300]   And the reason is the underlying mechanism isn't known.
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:09.660]   I'm not going to get into the argument
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.060]   about whether or not mechanistic understanding
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.620]   should or should not be required
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:17.760]   in order to have insurance coverage of things that work.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.080]   That's not what this is about.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.300]   And that actually would be a boring discussion
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:23.640]   because I'm shouting at a tunnel through you
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.280]   and I wouldn't be able to hear you shout back
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.180]   no matter what your stance on that is.
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:31.260]   But just trust me when I say that I am both relieved
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:32.860]   and delighted to hear
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:35.980]   that excellent medical institutions like Stanford
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:38.820]   are starting to think about electro-acupuncture
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:39.720]   and how it can work,
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.700]   that places like Harvard Medical School
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:44.220]   are starting to explore this at a mechanistic level.
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.800]   And I do believe that there's an open-mindedness
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.620]   that's starting to emerge.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:51.980]   For instance, the National Institutes of Health
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:54.060]   not only has an Institute for Mental Health
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.740]   and Cancer Research and an Eye Institute,
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:59.660]   but now Complementary Health, the so-called NCCIH,
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:01.940]   National Institutes of Complementary Health
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:04.600]   that is exploring things like electro-acupuncture,
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:08.040]   meditation, various supplements and things of those sort.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.580]   I do think that we're entering a new realm
[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:11.660]   in which things like pain and pain management
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:14.780]   will be met with more openness by all physicians.
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:15.940]   At least that's my hope.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:17.840]   So please take that into consideration.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.500]   Right now, the mechanistic evidence
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:23.140]   for laser photobiomodulation is not strong.
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:27.260]   One of the major issues or the barriers to that
[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:30.440]   is that most of the studies that are out there
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:35.440]   were actually paid for by companies that build devices
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:38.140]   for laser photobiomodulation.
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.340]   And so we really need independent studies
[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:41.900]   funded by federal institutions
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:44.500]   that have no bias or financial relationship
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:48.740]   in order to gain trust in whatever data happened to emerge.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:51.600]   There is a technique that at one time
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.020]   was considered alternative,
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:55.860]   but now has a lot of mechanistic science
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:57.260]   to explain how it works.
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:01.300]   And it does indeed work for the treatment of chronic
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.820]   and also for acute pain.
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:08.700]   And that treatment is hypnosis, in particular, self-hypnosis.
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:12.140]   My colleague at Stanford, in fact, my collaborator,
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:14.900]   Dr. David Spiegel, our associate chair of psychiatry,
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:16.620]   has devoted his professional life
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:20.260]   to developing hypnosis tools that people can use
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:22.460]   to help them sleep better, focus better,
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:24.700]   stay motivated, et cetera.
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.620]   While most people hear hypnosis and they think,
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.060]   oh, this is staged hypnosis,
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.440]   people walking around like chickens
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:33.100]   or being forced to laugh or fall asleep on command, et cetera,
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:34.580]   this is completely different than all that.
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.900]   This is self-hypnosis.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:39.580]   And there are now dozens, if not more,
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.240]   quality peer-reviewed studies
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:44.940]   published in excellent journals done by Dr. Spiegel
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:47.540]   and others at other universities.
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:50.620]   It really all has to do with how self-hypnosis
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:54.540]   can modulate activity of the prefrontal cortex
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:57.180]   and related structures like the insula.
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:02.180]   The prefrontal cortex is involved in our executive function,
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:04.260]   as it's called, our planning, our decision-making,
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:07.140]   but also how we interpret context,
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:10.120]   what the meaning of a given sensation is.
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:12.120]   And that's extremely powerful.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.980]   Just want to remind everybody that the currency
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:16.980]   of the brain and body has not changed
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:18.660]   in hundreds of thousands of years.
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:21.780]   It's always been dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA,
[01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:23.300]   testosterone, estrogen.
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:25.540]   What's changed are the contingencies,
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:28.020]   the events in the world that drive whether or not
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:31.060]   we get an increase or decrease in testosterone or estrogen,
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.400]   the events in the world that dictate whether or not
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.000]   we get an increase or a decrease in dopamine.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.720]   Believe me, the events that drove those increases
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.020]   and decreases were very different
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:42.460]   even a hundred years ago than they are now.
[01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:45.860]   And as we create new things and societies change, et cetera,
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:50.380]   they will continue to exchange information
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:52.980]   in the same currency, which is dopamine, serotonin,
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:55.380]   and all these other neuromodulators and chemicals.
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:58.020]   Hypnosis takes advantage of this
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:01.980]   by allowing an individual, you if you like,
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:04.560]   to change the way that you interpret particular events
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.940]   and to actually experience what would be painful
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.180]   as less painful or not painful.
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.500]   And that's just the example of pain.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.860]   Hypnosis is powerful for other reasons too.
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:15.640]   It actually can help rewire neural circuits
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.120]   so that you don't experience as much pain
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:20.180]   so that you can sleep faster, focus faster.
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:23.500]   If this is all sounding very fantastical,
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:26.060]   well, it's supported by data.
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:30.020]   The data are that when people do self-hypnosis,
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:33.220]   even brief self-hypnosis of 10 or 15 minutes
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:36.620]   a few times a week, maybe even return to that hypnosis
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:39.340]   by just using a one minute a day hypnosis,
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:43.340]   they can achieve significant and often very impressive
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:46.180]   degrees of pain relief and chronic pain,
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.720]   whether or not that chronic pain arises
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.620]   through things like fibromyalgia or through other sources.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:52.120]   If you want to check this out,
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.140]   there's a wonderful zero cost resource
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:56.220]   that's grounded in this work.
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.760]   It's the app reveri.com.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:03.640]   So R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.960]   There you can download a zero cost app
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:10.300]   for Apple phones or for Android phones.
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:12.640]   And there are a variety of different hypnosis scripts.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.240]   These are actually self-hypnosis scripts,
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:17.140]   and you'll actually hear Dr. David Spiegel talking to you.
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:19.640]   He can teach you about hypnosis and how it works.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.500]   There are links to scientific studies at that web address
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.900]   that I gave you before, reveri.com.
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:27.260]   You can see the various studies and the various writeups
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:29.540]   related to those studies and how this all works.
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:31.280]   And they're simple protocols.
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:33.740]   You just click on a tab and you listen to the self-hypnosis
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:36.140]   and it will take you into hypnosis.
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.540]   And several of those hypnosis scripts
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:42.780]   have been shown clinically to relieve certain patterns
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.200]   of chronic pain.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.680]   So it's a powerful tool.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:48.760]   And I encourage you not to write off the non-drug,
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.540]   non-supplement tools as less than powerful,
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:53.760]   because indeed many people experience
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.260]   tremendous relief from them.
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:59.020]   And of course they also can be combined with drug treatments
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:01.640]   if that's right for you or with supplements
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:03.180]   and things of that sort to treat pain
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:04.680]   if that's right for you.
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:08.840]   So again, electro-acupuncture now often supported
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.200]   by insurance, not always, but often.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.840]   Great mechanistic data starting to emerge.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:17.280]   Hypnosis, terrific tool.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.940]   There's even the self-hypnosis tool that one can access
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.920]   through the zero cost app, Reverie,
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:24.920]   and lots of great clinical data
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.640]   and scientific mechanistic data.
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.120]   There are neuroimaging studies showing
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.520]   that different brain areas are activated in hypnosis,
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.320]   so-called default network,
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:35.180]   kind of where your brain's kind of idols
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:37.980]   and the different circuits that are active at rest
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:40.220]   shift with hypnosis and shift long-term
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:42.320]   in ways that positively conserve you.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:45.200]   And then these things like laser photobiomodulation,
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.660]   still more or less in that experimental medical community,
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:51.320]   I should say Western medical community, not so certain,
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.520]   but hopefully there will be data soon.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.920]   And hopefully those data will point to mechanisms
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.400]   that allow the insurance companies
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.360]   and other sort of medical bodies
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:06.080]   to support them if indeed they have a mechanistic basis.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.560]   I just want to briefly touch on a common method
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.140]   of pain relief that speaks to a more general principle
[01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:14.400]   of how things like electroacupuncture
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:17.120]   and also some of these new emerging techniques
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.980]   of kind of like active tissue release
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:21.840]   and this principle that you hear a lot about
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.880]   in sports medicine now,
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.200]   that when you have pain or injury at one site,
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:28.000]   that you should provide pressure above and below that site.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.940]   You may have seen this in the Olympics,
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:31.760]   which is ongoing now,
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.680]   where people will put tape on their body
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.700]   at certain locations.
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:38.900]   Oftentimes the logic or what they're saying
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:42.120]   is that this is designed to create relief in a joint
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:45.080]   or in a limb that's below the tape,
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:48.180]   not necessarily under the tape, but above or below.
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:50.020]   So for instance, if there's pain in one shoulder,
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:53.000]   sometimes they will put it on the trapezius muscle
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:53.840]   or things of that sort.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.000]   It turns out that there is a basis for this
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.700]   because of the way that these different nerves run in
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.160]   from the skin and from the muscles
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:04.320]   up into the spinal cord and into the brainstem,
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.360]   providing pressure on one nerve pathway
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.880]   can often impact another pathway.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:10.500]   And the simplest and most common example of this
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.980]   is one that we all do instinctually or intuitively,
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:14.760]   even animals do this.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:17.240]   This is something that in the textbooks
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.000]   is called the GATE theory of pain
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.320]   developed by Melzack and Wall, kind of classic theory.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:25.960]   Basically we have receptors in our skin,
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.200]   the so-called C fibers.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.920]   That's just a name for these little wires
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:33.800]   that come from a particular class of DRGs that's very thin
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:37.460]   that brings about certain kinds of nociceptor information.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:40.380]   I want to say pain information, but then the pain people,
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:42.200]   believe it or not, they're pain people.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.460]   Sometimes they're a pain because what they tell me
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:46.880]   is there aren't pain receptors, okay, nociceptors.
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.340]   That information comes in through the C fibers.
[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:53.920]   And what happens when we injure something?
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:57.360]   Well, provided that we won't damage it worse by touching it,
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:01.440]   oftentimes what we will do is we will rub the source of pain
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:05.480]   or the location in which we were experiencing pain.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:10.480]   And it turns out that's not an useful thing to do.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.380]   When we rub our skin or an area,
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.540]   or we provide pressure nearby it,
[01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:18.360]   we activate the so-called A fibers,
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:22.120]   the bigger wires and neurons that innervate,
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.520]   meaning they jut into that area of skin.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.560]   And those A fibers,
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.200]   the ones that respond to mechanical pressure
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.240]   actually are able to inhibit those C fibers,
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.120]   the ones that are carrying that so-called pain information.
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:38.460]   So rubbing an area or providing pressure above
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.580]   or below an injury actually provides
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:45.160]   real pain relief support for the location of that injury
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:48.360]   or that pain because of the way that these different
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:51.560]   patterns or these different types of neurons interact
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:52.460]   with one another.
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:53.760]   When I say it inhibits it,
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.760]   I don't mean that it like shouts at it.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:58.520]   What it does is it releases it's literally kind of like,
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.240]   vomits up a little bit of a neurotransmitter called GABA.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.920]   And GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits,
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:08.200]   it quiets the activity of other neurons.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.860]   And so it's acting as kind of an analgesic, if you will,
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:15.640]   it's acting as its own form of drug that you make
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:19.040]   with your body to quiet the activity of these pain neurons.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.080]   So rubbing a wound provided it doesn't damage the wound
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.300]   worse or providing pressure above or below,
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:28.240]   typically it's above a particular injury,
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:30.720]   can have a real effect in relieving some of the pain
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:31.560]   of that injury.
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.020]   And some people have speculated this is through fascia
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:36.960]   or this is through other bodily organs and tissues.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:39.320]   And it might be, we're going to do a whole episode on fascia,
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.120]   it's extremely interesting tissue.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.100]   But right now it seems that the main source
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:47.400]   of that pain relief is through this A fiber inhibition
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:51.480]   of these C fibers, so-called Melzack and Wahl gate theory
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.980]   of pain, if you'd like to look it up
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:55.120]   and learn about that further.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:58.640]   Now let's talk about a phenomenon that has long intrigued
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:02.600]   and perplexed people for probably thousands of years,
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.160]   and that's redheads.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.720]   You may have heard before that redheads have a higher pain
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.040]   threshold than other individuals.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.840]   And indeed that is true.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:16.060]   There's now a study that looked at this mechanistically.
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:20.580]   There's a gene called the MC1R gene,
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:22.960]   and this MC1R gene encodes
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.440]   for a number of different proteins.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.060]   Some of those proteins, of course,
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:29.320]   are related to the production of melanin.
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.640]   This is why redheads often, not always,
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:33.720]   but often are very fair skinned,
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.820]   sometimes have freckles, not always,
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:37.480]   and of course have red hair.
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:40.060]   Some people are really intense gingers,
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:42.620]   not psychologically or emotionally intense,
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:45.460]   perhaps that too, but meaning their hair is very,
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:47.440]   very red, others it's a lighter red.
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.560]   So of course there's variation here, but this gene,
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:55.560]   this MC1R gene is associated with a pathway that relates
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.840]   to something that I've talked about on this podcast before
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:01.640]   during the episode on hunger and feeding.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:06.640]   And this is POMC, POMC stands for pro-opiomelanocortin,
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:13.360]   and POMC is cut up, it's cleaved into different hormones,
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:16.680]   including one that enhances pain perception.
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:19.340]   This is melanocyte stimulating hormone.
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:23.120]   And another one that blocks pain, beta endorphin.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.720]   Now, if you listen to the episodes on testosterone
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:29.280]   and estrogen and the episodes on hunger and feeding,
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.180]   some of these molecules will start to ring a bell.
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:34.480]   Things like melanostimulating hormone relate
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:35.940]   to pigmentation in the skin,
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.200]   relate to sexual arousal, et cetera.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.900]   But it turns out that in redheads,
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:43.460]   the because of the fact that they have this gene,
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:48.460]   this MC1R gene, the POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin,
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:51.260]   that's cut into different hormones,
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:52.900]   melanocyte stimulating hormone,
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:56.000]   and another one, beta endorphin.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.380]   Beta endorphin should cue you to the fact
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:00.980]   that this is in the pain pathway.
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:03.620]   The endorphins are endogenously made,
[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:06.500]   meaning made within our body opioids.
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:09.880]   They actually make us feel numb
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.420]   in response to certain kinds of pain.
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:12.780]   Now, not completely numb,
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:16.960]   but they numb or reduce our perception of pain
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.420]   because of the ways in which they are released
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:20.820]   from certain brain centers.
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:23.300]   We'll talk about those brain centers in a moment.
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:27.460]   So what's really interesting is that this study showed
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:31.500]   that the presence of these hormones is in everybody.
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:35.380]   We all have melanocortin-4, we all have beta endorphins,
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:37.560]   we all have POMC, et cetera.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:41.700]   But redheads make more of these endogenous endorphins.
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:42.780]   And that's interesting.
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:46.140]   It allows them to buffer against the pain response.
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.940]   I have a personal anecdote to share with you
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:50.860]   about this redhead and heightened levels
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:52.860]   of pain tolerance phenomenon.
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:55.940]   Obviously, I'm not a redhead, I don't dye my hair,
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:59.260]   but my partner for many years was a redhead
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:00.540]   and still is a redhead.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:04.220]   She had bright red hair and had that since childhood.
[01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:08.740]   Well, we had the fortunate experience of becoming friends
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.880]   with Wim Hof and family.
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.500]   They actually came out to visit us
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.500]   and did a series of seminars in the Bay Area.
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:18.400]   This was in 2016, as I recall.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:22.740]   And my partner, she had never done an ice bath.
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:25.400]   She had never done any kind of real cold water
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.100]   exposure experience before,
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:28.680]   but it is one particular gathering,
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.540]   as is often the case when Wim is around,
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:32.080]   there was an ice bath and a number of people
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:32.980]   were getting into this thing.
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:34.900]   This was actually before a dinner event.
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:38.020]   And I think for most people who have never done an ice bath
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:41.860]   getting in for 30 seconds or a minute is tolerable,
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:43.220]   but it takes some effort,
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:45.420]   it takes some willpower and takes some overcoming
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:47.780]   that pain barrier 'cause it is a little bit painful,
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:48.620]   not a lot.
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:51.980]   Some people can stay in longer, three minutes,
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:54.740]   five minutes without much discomfort.
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:57.680]   What was incredible is that without any desire
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:01.220]   to compete with anybody else, my partner, redhead,
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:04.580]   got into the ice bath and just like sat there for 10 minutes.
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:06.260]   In fact, at one point, she just kind of turned to me
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:10.780]   and said, "I don't really feel pain.
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:12.100]   I'm not really in pain."
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:13.220]   And Wim loved this.
[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:14.140]   Wim thought it was great.
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:15.900]   He thought it was like the most terrific thing in the world.
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:18.220]   And he got back in the ice bath and they became fast friends
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:20.820]   and I think they're probably still fast friends.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:23.280]   So in any event, that's an N of one,
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:25.860]   what we call an anecdotal example.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:28.220]   Anecdotal is not really a term that we should use too much
[01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:31.380]   'cause it's N of one anecdotes are just that,
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:32.720]   they're just anecdotes.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.840]   But it's been described many times in various clinics
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.840]   that were by anesthesiologists,
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:41.320]   by observation of coaches, et cetera,
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:45.140]   that redheads, men and women who are redheads,
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:47.140]   seem to have this higher pain threshold.
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:49.220]   And it does seem to be because their body
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:53.920]   naturally produces ways to counter the pain response.
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:56.760]   They produce their own endogenous opioids.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.120]   Now this of course should not be taken to mean
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.620]   that redheads can tolerate more pain
[01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:03.940]   and therefore should be subjected to more pain.
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:07.780]   All it means is that their threshold for pain on average,
[01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:11.040]   not all of them, but on average is shifted higher
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.960]   than that of other individuals.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.760]   And it remains to be determined whether or not
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:18.460]   other light-skinned, light-haired individuals
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:20.980]   also have a heightened level of pain threshold.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:23.440]   And I should mention because I mentioned the ice bath
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:26.160]   that of course pain threshold is something
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:28.920]   that can be built up and provide you to do that safely
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.100]   in ways that aren't damaging your tissues
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:33.560]   because of course pain is a signal that is designed
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:36.280]   to help you to keep from harming yourself.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:38.580]   But provided that you can do that in a way that's safe
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:41.120]   and doesn't damage your tissues,
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:43.320]   increasing your pain threshold through the use of things
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:45.960]   like ice baths is something that really can be done.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:48.380]   It has a lot to do with these contextual
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:51.360]   or top-down modulations of the experience.
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:55.040]   You can tell yourself that this is good for me
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.360]   or I'm doing this by choice or whatever it is,
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:58.440]   you could distract yourself.
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:43:59.920]   There are a huge number of different ways
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.140]   that one could do that.
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:03.200]   One of the more interesting ways
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.040]   for which there are actually really good scientific data
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.800]   come from my colleague, Sean Mackey's lab.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:12.040]   And that actually looked at how love
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:16.000]   and in particular the experience of obsessive love
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.640]   could actually counter the pain response,
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:21.400]   not just in redheads, but in everybody.
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:24.640]   So that study I'll just briefly describe.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.640]   It involved having people come into the laboratory
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.740]   and experience any one or a number
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:30.580]   of different painful stimuli,
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:33.380]   but they had selectively recruited subjects
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:35.220]   that were in new relationships
[01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:38.080]   for which there was a high degree of infatuation.
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.680]   So much so that the people couldn't stop thinking about
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.640]   or communicating with that new partner
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:47.240]   up to 80% of their waking time, which is a lot.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.560]   That constant obsessing about that partner
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.160]   was correlated with, it wasn't causal necessarily,
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:57.020]   but was correlated with the ability
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:59.400]   to sustain higher levels of pain
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:02.720]   than people who were in more typical
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:05.820]   non-obsessive forms of love,
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:07.400]   longstanding relationships
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:10.480]   where there wasn't long obsessive love rather.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.040]   And of course, in this study,
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.960]   there were a lot of good control groups.
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.960]   They included a distractor.
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:18.780]   They included people obsessing about other things,
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:19.720]   their pet, et cetera.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:23.720]   They included other forms of love and attachment,
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:26.380]   but it does seem that certain patterns of thinking
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:30.020]   can allow us to buffer ourselves against the pain response.
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:32.520]   And that should not be surprising.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.520]   Certain forms of thinking are associated
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.800]   with the release of particular neuromodulators,
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.480]   in particular dopamine.
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.240]   And dopamine, it may seem is kind of the thing
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.160]   that underlies everything, but it's not.
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:46.800]   Dopamine is a molecule that's associated
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:49.740]   with novelty, expectation, motivation, and reward.
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:52.200]   We talked about this at the beginning of the episode,
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:55.280]   that it's really the molecule of expectation
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:58.440]   and motivation and hope and excitement
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.100]   more than it's associated with the receival of the reward.
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:05.840]   Well, dopamine is coursing throughout the brain
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.200]   at heightened levels and coursing throughout the body
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:11.160]   at heightened levels when we fall in love.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.580]   This probably has some adaptive mechanism
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:17.080]   that ensured pair bonding between people or who knows,
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.280]   maybe it ensured not bonding to multiple people.
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:22.400]   Nobody really knows how dopamine functions
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.800]   in terms of pair bonding,
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.100]   but it is known that when people fall in love,
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:31.600]   new relationships create very high levels of dopamine.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.440]   And that's probably the mechanistic basis
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:37.600]   by which these people were able to buffer the pain response
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:40.160]   by thinking about their partner
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.920]   or this new relationship that they're in
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:44.600]   almost obsessively or obsessively.
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.440]   Now that raises a deeper question.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.680]   We should always be asking, yeah, but how, how?
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:52.840]   Well, the dopamine system can have powerful effects
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.760]   on the inflammation system.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:57.060]   And it doesn't do this through mysterious ways.
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:00.240]   It does this by interacting through the brainstem
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:03.120]   and some of the neurons that innervate the spleen
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.280]   and other areas of the body that deploy cells
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:11.280]   to go combat infection, inflammation, and pain.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:14.120]   And the ways in which dopamine can modulate pain,
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:16.720]   and in this case, this particular study,
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:18.440]   transform our experience of pain,
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:21.240]   maybe even into something that's pleasureful,
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.640]   is not mysterious.
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:25.960]   It's really through the activation of brainstem neurons
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.780]   that communicate with areas of our body
[01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:31.520]   that deploy things like immune cells.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:34.780]   So for instance, we have neurons in our brainstem
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:38.400]   that can be modulated by the release of dopamine.
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.240]   And those neurons in the brainstem
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:42.540]   control the release of immune cells
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:45.920]   from tissues like the spleen or organs like the spleen.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.800]   And those immune cells can then go combat infection.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.460]   We've heard before that when we're happy,
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:53.600]   we're better able to combat infection, deal with pain,
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.120]   deal with all sorts of things,
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:57.160]   it essentially makes us more resilient.
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:59.760]   And that's not because dopamine is some magic molecule.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:02.460]   It's because dopamine affects particular circuits
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:05.560]   and tells in a very neurobiological way,
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.800]   in a biochemical way,
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:10.140]   tells those cells and circuits that conditions are good.
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:12.040]   Despite the fact that there's pain in the body,
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:12.960]   conditions are good.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:14.480]   You're in love or conditions are good.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:17.560]   You want to be in this experience or conditions are good.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:20.060]   This is for a greater cause that you're fighting
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:22.540]   or suffering for some larger purpose.
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:25.560]   So all of that has existed largely in the realm of psychology
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:28.140]   and even motivational literature and this kind of thing,
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:30.080]   but there's a real mechanistic basis for it.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:32.740]   Dopamine is a molecule that can bind to receptor sites
[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:34.020]   on these brain areas.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:36.140]   Those brain areas can then modulate the organs
[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:37.560]   and tissues of the body
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.980]   that can allow us to lean into challenge.
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.580]   And those challenges can be infection.
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:43.120]   It can be physical pain.
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.060]   It can be long bouts of effort that are required of us.
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:50.240]   And I think many people have described the feeling
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:53.340]   of being newly in love as a heightened level of energy,
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:54.640]   a capacity to do anything.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.160]   I mean, the whole concept of a muse
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:00.180]   is one in which some individual or some thing,
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:03.060]   either imagined or real, enters our life
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:06.640]   and we can use that as fuel.
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.900]   And that fuel is chemical fuel
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:10.820]   and that chemical fuel is dopamine.
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:12.760]   And it really does allow for more resilience
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:15.740]   and can even transform the experience of pain
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:17.500]   or what would otherwise be pain
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:19.460]   into an experience of pleasure.
[01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:22.220]   So along those lines, let's talk about pleasure.
[01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:24.520]   With all the cells and tissues and machinery
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.100]   related to pain,
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:28.540]   you might think that our entire touch system
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:31.340]   is designed to allow us to detect pain
[01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:32.660]   and to avoid tissue damage.
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:36.420]   And while a good percentage of it is devoted to that,
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:38.440]   a good percentage of it is also devoted
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.900]   to this thing that we call pleasure.
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:43.300]   And that should come as no surprise.
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:46.460]   Pleasure isn't just there for our pleasure.
[01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:48.460]   It serves an adaptive role.
[01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:50.480]   And that adaptive role relates to the fact
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:52.860]   that every species has a primary goal,
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:54.820]   which is to make more of itself.
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:56.900]   Otherwise it would go extinct.
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:01.580]   That process of making more of itself, sexual reproduction,
[01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:04.340]   is closely associated with the sensation
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:06.060]   and the perception of pleasure.
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:10.380]   And it's no surprise that not only is the highest density
[01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:15.220]   of sensory receptors in and on and around the genitalia,
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:19.100]   but the process of reproduction evokes sensations
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:22.460]   and molecules and perceptions associated with pleasure.
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:24.860]   And the currency of pleasure
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:27.160]   exists in multiple chemical systems,
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:29.940]   but the primary ones are the dopamine system,
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.780]   which is the anticipation of pleasure
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:37.700]   and the work required to achieve the ability
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:39.520]   to experience that pleasure
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:41.580]   and the serotonin system,
[01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:43.080]   which is more closely related
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:45.560]   to the immediate experience of that pleasure.
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:49.520]   And from dopamine and serotonin stem out other hormones
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:52.180]   and molecules, things like oxytocin,
[01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:53.800]   which are associated with pair bonding.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:55.980]   Oxytocin is more closely associated
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:57.580]   with the serotonin system,
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:00.180]   biochemically and at the circuit level,
[01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:01.880]   meaning the areas of the brain and body
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:05.160]   that manufacture a lot of serotonin, usually, not always,
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:07.900]   but usually contain neurons that also manufacture
[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:10.400]   and make use of the molecule oxytocin.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:15.460]   Those chemicals together create sensations of warmth,
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:18.520]   of wellbeing, of safety.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:21.800]   The dopamine molecule is more closely associated
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:24.200]   with hormones like testosterone
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:26.960]   and other molecules involved with pursuit
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:30.500]   and further effort in order to get more of whatever
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:33.340]   could potentially cause more release of dopamine.
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:36.840]   So this is a very broad strokes, no pun intended,
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:39.680]   description of the pleasure system.
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.680]   There are, of course, other molecules as well.
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.400]   One in particular that's very interesting
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.600]   is something called PEA.
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:49.880]   PEA stands for phenylethylamine,
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:53.000]   sometimes also referred to as phenylethylamine,
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.120]   depending on who you are and where you live.
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:59.040]   How you pronounce it doesn't really matter.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:03.760]   PEA is a molecule which is incredibly potent
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:08.080]   at augmenting or increasing the activity of certain cells
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:11.560]   and neural circuits that relate to the pleasure system.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:16.120]   PEA has purportedly been thought to be released
[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:17.720]   in response to ingestion of things
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:19.800]   like certain forms of dark chocolate.
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:21.760]   Some people take it in supplement form.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.040]   It's a bit of a stimulant,
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:27.540]   but it also seems to heighten the perception of pleasure
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:29.460]   in response to a particular amount
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:31.440]   of dopamine and/or serotonin.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:34.440]   So for instance, in a kind of a arbitrary experiment
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.200]   and units type example,
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:39.680]   if a given experience evokes a particular amount
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:42.220]   of serotonin and dopamine and gives rise
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:44.120]   to a subjective experience of pleasure
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:46.200]   of say level three out of 10,
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:48.680]   the ingestion of PEA prior to that experience
[01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:51.880]   can increase the rating of that experience
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:55.620]   as more pleasureful, maybe a four or a five or even a six.
[01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:59.480]   And PEA is known to be present in,
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:02.000]   or I should say its release is stimulated
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.080]   by a number of different compounds such as dark chocolate,
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:07.840]   certain things like aspartame
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.920]   and certain people can actually increase
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:11.540]   the amount of PEA released.
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:15.340]   Some of these glutamate related molecules like aspartame
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:17.080]   or things that are in the glutamate pathway
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:18.700]   can increase PEA release.
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:20.840]   And then some people will actually take PEA
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:25.280]   in supplement form for its mild stimulant properties
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:28.960]   as well as for increasing the perception of
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:31.540]   or the ability to experience pleasure.
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:35.960]   It's not a sledgehammer, it's not a like dopamine itself.
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:38.120]   People that take things like macuna purines,
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:40.460]   L-DOPA or drugs of abuse,
[01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:41.800]   which I certainly don't recommend,
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:44.720]   things like cocaine or amphetamine
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:47.900]   experience tremendous increases in dopamine,
[01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:50.520]   not so much increases in serotonin.
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:55.160]   Some people will take serotonin in precursor form
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.540]   like 5-HTP or serotonin itself,
[01:53:57.540 --> 01:54:00.400]   or they'll take the amino acid precursor like tryptophan.
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.380]   I'm not saying these things as recommendations
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:04.460]   for increasingly one sense of pleasure.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:07.280]   I'm describing them because of what they do
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:09.960]   generally falls into two categories.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:13.700]   The first category is to raise the foundation,
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:17.360]   what we call the tonic level of dopamine and serotonin.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:22.360]   So if levels of serotonin and dopamine are too low,
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:27.480]   it becomes almost impossible to experience pleasure.
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:29.760]   There's a so-called ahedonia.
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:31.820]   This is also described as depression,
[01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:34.660]   although it needn't be long-term depression.
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:37.460]   So certain drugs like antidepressants,
[01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:42.180]   like Wellbutrin, Bupriarone as it's commonly called,
[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:44.280]   or the so-called SSRIs,
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:47.980]   the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, excuse me,
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:50.000]   like Prozac, Zoloft and similar
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.260]   will increase dopamine and serotonin respectively.
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:56.920]   They're not increasing the peaks in those molecules.
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:00.160]   What we call the acute release of those molecules,
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:02.720]   what they're doing is they're raising the overall levels
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:03.560]   of those molecules.
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:06.500]   They're raising the sort of foundation or the tide,
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:08.740]   if you will, think about it as your mood
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:11.040]   or your pleasure rather is like a boat.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:13.760]   And if it's on the shore and it can't get out to sea
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.160]   unless that tide is high enough,
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:17.440]   that's kind of the way to think about these tonic levels
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.000]   of dopamine and serotonin.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.500]   Now, most of us fortunately do not have problems
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:25.160]   with our baseline or our tonic levels
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.360]   of dopamine and serotonin release.
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:29.240]   Things like PEA in that case
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:31.860]   will cause a slight increase in that tide
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:36.560]   and make the ability of certain experiences
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:40.200]   to increase dopamine further more available.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:44.080]   What we call this in neuroscience is so-called gain control.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.120]   It can kind of turn up the volume,
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:47.960]   bring us closer to the threshold
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.560]   to activate certain circuits.
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.140]   And this is really what we mean
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:54.360]   when we say a neuromodulator, okay?
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:57.840]   This is why when you are very happy about something,
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:59.320]   let's say you're out with your friends,
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:01.000]   you're really excited, you know,
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.600]   maybe depending on where you live
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:04.500]   and what's going on in your area of the world right now,
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.320]   like, you know, like I have a niece
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:07.920]   and she's been locked up in quarantine
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:10.220]   for a long time recently because it was deemed safe.
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:11.580]   She got to go to summer camp.
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:14.920]   I have never seen that kid so happy to spend,
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:16.880]   excuse me, spend time with her friends.
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:20.560]   She was so excited and it was really amazing
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:21.640]   to see how excited she was.
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:24.680]   Her baseline levels of dopamine were clearly up.
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:28.200]   So much so that when she saw her friends,
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:30.560]   she literally started squealing, okay?
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:31.920]   They were squealing, she was squealing.
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:32.760]   Everyone was squealing.
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:33.760]   I wasn't squealing.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:35.160]   I would admit it if I was squealing.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:37.800]   I wasn't squealing, but it was such a delight to see.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:39.860]   And I'm sure that made my dopamine levels go up,
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:41.720]   which was, she was just so excited,
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:43.560]   such that anything and everything
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:45.000]   felt like an exciting stimulus.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.800]   This is pleasure, right?
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.600]   And I don't want to write off the experience
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:51.600]   from a neurobiological reductionist standpoint,
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:52.440]   quite the opposite.
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.400]   It's really beautiful to see, again,
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:57.800]   this principle that different experiences
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:01.020]   and the experience of pleasure from different things,
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.420]   seeing your friends for the first time,
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:06.200]   summer camp for a kid, whatever it might happen to be,
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:08.780]   use the same currency, dopamine,
[01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:11.400]   use the same currency, serotonin.
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.000]   And this is a principle that I hope
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.360]   in listening to this podcast
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.140]   and even some of its repetitive features
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:18.680]   from one episode to the next,
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:20.780]   I'm hoping that those will start to embed in your mind
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:24.100]   that the brain and body use these common currencies
[01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:25.540]   for different experiences.
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:27.740]   So yes, if your dopamine and serotonin,
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.700]   or I should say if your dopamine
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:32.780]   and/or serotonin levels are too low,
[01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:34.820]   it will be very hard to achieve pleasure,
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:36.440]   to experience physical pleasure
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:38.660]   or emotional pleasure of any kind.
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:40.700]   That's why treatments of the sort
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:43.740]   that I described a minute ago might be right for you.
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:45.500]   Obviously, we can't determine if they're right for you.
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:47.140]   It's also why they have side effects.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.900]   If you artificially increase these molecules
[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:51.620]   that are associated with pleasure,
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:53.940]   oftentimes you get a lack of motivation
[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:55.360]   to go seek things like food.
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:57.160]   People don't get much interest in food
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:58.100]   'cause why should they
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:00.260]   if their serotonin levels are already up?
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:02.820]   Again, there's a ton of individual variation.
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:05.100]   I don't want to say that these antidepressants
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:06.340]   are always bad.
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:08.300]   Sometimes they've saved lives.
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:09.640]   They've saved millions of lives.
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:10.920]   Sometimes people have side effects
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:12.520]   that make them not the right choice.
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:14.820]   So it has to be determined for the individual.
[01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:18.640]   Things like PEA are a more subtle effect.
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:21.120]   I should mention PEA supplementation
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:23.180]   is something that a number of people use,
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:24.580]   but it's very short-lived.
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:27.760]   Because of the half-life of this molecule is very brief,
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:30.560]   the effect only lasts about 20 minutes or so.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:33.220]   Things like L-DOPA,
[01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:38.220]   macunipurines lead to longer baseline increases in dopamine.
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:42.100]   But remember, anytime you raise a baseline,
[01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:46.180]   you reduce the so-called signal to noise.
[01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:48.080]   What it means is if you're riding around
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:49.460]   at really high dopamine,
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:51.780]   at first, everything will start to seem exciting.
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:53.740]   Like my niece and seeing her friends for the first time,
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:55.220]   everything's exciting.
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:56.260]   But then what will happen
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:59.620]   is when your dopamine levels return to more normal levels,
[01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:02.780]   it will take a much greater dopamine increase,
[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:06.020]   a much bigger event, more novel, more exciting
[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:08.540]   in order to achieve the sense
[01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:11.380]   that what you're experiencing is pleasureful.
[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:13.380]   And this is because of the relationship
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:15.420]   between pleasure and pain.
[01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:16.580]   Now, in a future episode,
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:18.540]   we are going to go deep into this relationship
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:20.340]   between pleasure and pain.
[01:59:20.340 --> 01:59:23.240]   But just briefly, as a precursor to that,
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:24.380]   and because it's relevant
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:26.580]   to the conversation that we've been having,
[01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:31.700]   you might want to be wary of any experience,
[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:34.720]   any experience, no matter how it arrives,
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:38.480]   chemical, physical, emotional, or some combination.
[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:39.860]   You might want to be wary
[01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:42.060]   of letting your dopamine go too high,
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:44.220]   and certainly you want to be wary of it going too low
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:46.540]   because of the way that these circuits adjust.
[01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:48.940]   Basically, every time that the pleasure system
[01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:51.820]   is kicked in in high gear,
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:54.180]   an absolutely spectacular event,
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:56.860]   you cannot be more ecstatic.
[01:59:56.860 --> 02:00:01.860]   There is a mirror symmetric activation of the pain system.
[02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:05.740]   And this might seem like an evil curse of biology,
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:06.580]   but it's not.
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:09.760]   This is actually a way to protect this whole system
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:11.900]   of reward and motivation that I talked about
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:14.140]   at the beginning of the episode.
[02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:16.380]   It might sound great to just ingest substances
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:18.340]   or engage in behaviors where it's just dopamine,
[02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:21.440]   dopamine, dopamine, and just constantly be motivated,
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:23.980]   but the system will eventually crash.
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:24.840]   And so what happens is
[02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:26.900]   when you have a big increase in dopamine,
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:29.940]   you also will get a big increase in the circuits
[02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:32.940]   that underlie our sense of disappointment
[02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:34.940]   and readjusting the balance.
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:38.020]   And with repeated exposure to high levels of dopamine,
[02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:40.720]   not naturally occurring wonderful events,
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:45.720]   but really high chemically induced peaks in dopamine,
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:49.220]   high magnitude chemically induced peaks in dopamine,
[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:51.300]   what happens is those peaks in dopamine
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:53.600]   start to go down and down and down
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:55.280]   in response to the same,
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:57.780]   what ought to be incredible experience.
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:01.380]   We start to what's called habituate or attenuate,
[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:05.800]   and yet the pain increases in size.
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:08.340]   And this has a preservative function
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:11.000]   in keeping us safe, believe it or not.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.340]   But what I just described is actually the basis
[02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:16.100]   of most, if not all forms of addiction,
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:17.360]   something that we will deal with
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:19.360]   in a future episode in depth.
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:20.820]   So what should you think about all this?
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:21.920]   How should you think about pleasure
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:23.360]   and how should you think about pain?
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:25.240]   What is too much pleasure?
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:28.840]   Well, that's going to differ from person to person,
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:33.380]   but to the extent that one can access pleasure repeatedly
[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:37.640]   over time, ideally without chemical augmentation,
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:40.020]   certainly not excessive chemical augmentation,
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.660]   that means that this pleasure system is tuned up well
[02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:44.460]   and can continue to experience pleasure.
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:47.540]   However, if you find yourself engaging
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:50.080]   in the same behavior over and over again,
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:52.880]   but achieving less and less pleasure from it,
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:56.320]   chances are you want to adjust down
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:58.820]   how often you engage in that behavior
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:04.400]   and or adjust down your expectation of reward
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:06.580]   every time you engage in that behavior.
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:08.920]   What do I mean by that?
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:10.320]   Well, at the beginning of the episode,
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:13.760]   I talked about how dopamine will allow us
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:15.780]   to get into bouts of hard work.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:19.020]   We will work very hard to pursue a reward
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:20.400]   and that's really what dopamine does.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:21.820]   And then when the reward comes,
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:24.040]   that doesn't increase our dopamine.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:26.200]   In fact, our dopamine levels go down.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:30.580]   One of the key things that we can all do
[02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:34.260]   to adjust our ability to experience pleasure
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:38.840]   is to engage in that intermittent reward schedule.
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:41.580]   You can either adjust down the peak in dopamine,
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:43.440]   meaning not let yourself ever get too happy,
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:44.540]   but that's no fun, right?
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:49.540]   Life is about occasionally achieving or experiencing ecstasy
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:52.820]   but every once in a while, remove the reward.
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:54.300]   And of course I don't mean ecstasy the drug,
[02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:55.180]   that's a separate matter.
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:02:57.600]   The MDMA trials are a separate matter, very interesting.
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:02:59.660]   I want to be clear, I meant psychological
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:03.180]   and physical ecstasy of the natural sort.
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:06.920]   I immense interest in what's going on in the MDMA trials,
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:09.340]   but just for clarity purposes,
[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:11.420]   that's a separate topic that we will cover
[02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:14.340]   in an episode, excuse me, very soon.
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:17.260]   So how do you adjust this dopamine system?
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:20.020]   Well, every once in a while at random,
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:24.980]   not in a predictable way, you remove the reward
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:27.760]   and that will keep you and your dopamine system
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:30.040]   tuned up in the proper ways.
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:32.600]   The gain of the dopamine system, as we say,
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:34.900]   will be adjusted so that you can continue
[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:37.220]   to experience dopamine and serotonin
[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:38.820]   when you actually get the reward.
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:42.860]   This can be translated into a huge number
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:45.240]   of different domains, but I want to give some examples
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:47.280]   because I'm sure that many of you are asking,
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:48.460]   wait, what does this actually mean?
[02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:50.200]   Okay, let's say you're a student
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:52.840]   or this could be a student in academia
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:56.180]   or this could be a student of a physical practice.
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:59.100]   Every once in a while, when you do something really well,
[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:02.540]   maybe that's even just showing up to the practice.
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:06.020]   Rather than pat yourself on the back, just tell yourself,
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:08.120]   yeah, that's the minimum that's expected of me.
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:10.580]   When everyone's excited about something that you're doing,
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:12.080]   maybe you're excited about it,
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:14.820]   try and adjust down your excitement a little bit.
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:16.860]   I know this might seem counterintuitive,
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:20.140]   but you're preserving the ability to experience excitement
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:21.940]   in a variety of contexts.
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:25.500]   Let's say you get a big monetary award.
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:30.300]   Well, that's great, I'm happy for you and that's wonderful.
[02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:33.100]   However, you should be a little bit wary
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:34.760]   if you care about your dopamine system
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:35.880]   and you care about your ability
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:39.700]   to get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me,
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:42.540]   awards, rewards, doesn't matter which, through effort.
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.540]   If you want to be able to maintain the ability
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:47.300]   to exert effort, well, then you probably wouldn't want
[02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:49.460]   to run out and immediately buy something
[02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:51.160]   with that monetary reward.
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:52.620]   In other words, you wouldn't want to layer on
[02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:55.520]   more dopamine release, okay?
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:59.440]   You might, but you might not, you might skip it.
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:01.500]   What you'll find then is that your motivation
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:03.060]   is essentially infinite.
[02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:05.480]   This is what I described at the beginning of the episode.
[02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:08.660]   And again, it's because dopamine is this currency.
[02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:11.200]   It's like a, these days you hear a lot about Bitcoin
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:15.140]   and Ethereum and Dogecoin and US dollars and euros
[02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:16.700]   and all this other stuff.
[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:20.740]   But the currency that you use in your body
[02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:23.140]   doesn't matter what external currency those are.
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:25.740]   In fact, as you watch the value of different currencies
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:27.300]   go up, whether or not it's cryptocurrency
[02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:30.880]   or standard currency, the value is actually reflective
[02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:33.800]   of the dopamine that exists inside of people, right?
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:36.400]   So all the excitement about a particular currency,
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:39.620]   crypto or otherwise, is really just dopamine.
[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:42.900]   That's the currency that we all use.
[02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:44.680]   And there's no negotiating that.
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:46.760]   That's just the way that we're built.
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:48.780]   Now, to give yet other examples,
[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:51.100]   let's say you're teaching other people how to do something
[02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:53.340]   and they do something exceptionally well.
[02:05:53.340 --> 02:05:55.740]   If you reward them every single time,
[02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:57.980]   and in particular, if you reward them with something
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:00.900]   that's even greater than the experience of what they did,
[02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:04.100]   so let's say kids win a soccer game and they're ecstatic,
[02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:06.460]   they're jumping all over the place, they're super excited,
[02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:09.620]   and you reward them with an even bigger experience,
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:14.520]   a celebration, you are actually inhibiting their ability
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:17.640]   to perform the same set of activities
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:19.820]   that led them to the win if,
[02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:21.040]   and I really want to underscore,
[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:22.940]   if you reward them every time.
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:26.260]   Of course, we should reward kids and each other
[02:06:26.260 --> 02:06:28.380]   and ourselves for our accomplishments,
[02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:30.780]   but you don't want to do it every time.
[02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:32.980]   And sure, there will be some disappointment
[02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:37.840]   from suddenly removing the reward that you expected,
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:39.180]   but that's exactly the point.
[02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:41.820]   That's what keeps these circuits tuned up properly.
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:43.300]   Now there's the other form of pleasure,
[02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:48.300]   which is the more immediate visceral or sensory experience
[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:49.560]   of pleasure.
[02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:51.720]   This is distinct from goals and goal-directed behavior.
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:53.320]   I'm talking about the immediate experience.
[02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:55.800]   This is more of the serotonergic system.
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:57.560]   There are other systems involved too,
[02:06:57.560 --> 02:07:00.840]   but this is also the system that draws out
[02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:04.120]   those endogenous opioids from a particular structure.
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:06.520]   We have a structure in the back of our brain called PAG,
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:10.000]   P-A-G, it's the periaqueductal gray area.
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.800]   Very interesting brain area that is associated
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:14.300]   with pain, but also with pleasure,
[02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:16.460]   because under certain conditions,
[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:19.340]   it deploys endogenous opioids
[02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:22.260]   and gives us a kind of blissed out feeling, okay?
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:25.580]   This is not like the opioids of the opioid epidemic sort
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:28.000]   that people take, and unfortunately have led
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.440]   to tremendous amounts of suffering and abuse.
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:32.960]   These are endogenously released opioids.
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.400]   These are the kind of opioids that come out
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:38.060]   from long distance bouts of physical exercise and running.
[02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:40.140]   These are the opioids that are deployed
[02:07:40.140 --> 02:07:42.940]   in response to giving birth and overcoming
[02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:45.800]   the tremendous pain of childbirth.
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:48.360]   So PAG is very contextual,
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:51.200]   and there are a few types of stimuli,
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:53.800]   or I should say events in life.
[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:55.280]   I'm really showing my nerdy side.
[02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:56.740]   There are a few types of stimuli,
[02:07:56.740 --> 02:07:58.240]   I'm talking about experiences,
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:02.280]   that evoke endogenous opioid release from PAG.
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:05.020]   One is sexual activity.
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:08.380]   Sexual activity can increase pain threshold,
[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:12.820]   and here I am not suggesting or getting involved
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:15.520]   in anyone's particular proclivities or personal experiences.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:18.020]   You're welcome to editorialize this however you like.
[02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:21.180]   However, what I'm talking about are animal data,
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:23.180]   and yes, human data as well,
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:25.260]   that show that pain thresholds are increased
[02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:28.400]   anytime PAG is activated because of the release
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:30.160]   of these endogenous opioids.
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:35.060]   There's also the immediate experience
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:37.240]   of whether or not a particular form of touch
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:38.780]   is pleasureful or not.
[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:40.740]   And there, there's some very interesting biology
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:43.420]   that relates to really how those little wires
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:45.520]   from those DRGs innervate our skin.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:50.380]   Work studies, I should say, done by David Ginty's lab
[02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:51.500]   at Harvard Medical School.
[02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:54.140]   The Ginty lab has spent years working
[02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:56.860]   on the somatosensory system, the touch system,
[02:08:56.860 --> 02:09:00.380]   has identified a particular category of neurons
[02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:01.460]   that innervate the skin,
[02:09:01.460 --> 02:09:02.500]   and then those neurons, of course,
[02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:04.620]   send that information up to the brain too,
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:08.440]   and they actually respond to direction of touch.
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:10.240]   Now, some of you might be more sensitive
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:14.880]   to this than others, but it turns out that certain hairs
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:17.820]   like to be deflected one way versus another.
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:20.620]   Whether or not you like cats or not,
[02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:22.000]   you can do this experiment.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.120]   You can pet a cat in the direction that their fur lies.
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:26.760]   So it lies down in a particular direction.
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:28.040]   You'll notice that there's actually a gene
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:29.640]   that dictates that the hairs lie down
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:30.760]   in a particular direction.
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:34.700]   And if you pet them in a way that's cooperating
[02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:39.340]   with that direction, so not pushing the hairs up,
[02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:42.540]   but rather stroking the hairs on the back of the cat,
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:44.060]   what you'll notice is they often like that.
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:45.880]   Not all cats, some cats are pretty grouchy,
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:49.560]   but if you stroke their hair, they will often purr,
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:51.260]   they'll often push into you.
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:53.800]   If you were to stroke their hair in the opposite direction,
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:56.160]   pushing the hairs up against the direction
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:59.320]   that they want to lie down, cats do not like that.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:01.120]   And it turns out people don't like that either.
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:03.040]   Some people do like to have their hair pushed
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:05.220]   in a direction against the direction
[02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:07.000]   in which it wants to lay down,
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.760]   but there is more typically a response
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:13.200]   of feeling like it's pleasureful for, for instance,
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.820]   when someone brushes or combs their hair
[02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:16.400]   in the direction that it wants to lay down.
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:19.160]   And that's because the way in which these neurons
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:22.000]   that innervate these hairs sends information
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.800]   up to the brain, bifurcates actually,
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:27.040]   it splits into brain centers that evoke a sense of pleasure
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:28.520]   or a sense of not pleasure.
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:30.100]   It's not necessarily pain.
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:34.000]   So you might find that certain people are very particular.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.200]   They like to be touched in a certain way, but not others.
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:38.000]   You might be one of those people.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.620]   And areas of our skin that have high density of receptors
[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:45.720]   are very, very sensitive in a real way,
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:49.600]   in a real sense of the word, to patterns of touch
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:53.680]   and whether or not a touch is too firm or too light.
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:58.560]   And that will be modulated by overall levels of arousal.
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.760]   And when I talk about arousal,
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:02.460]   what I'm talking about is how alert or how sleepy we are.
[02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:05.280]   It is impossible to experience pain
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:07.620]   when we are deep in sleep.
[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:09.600]   I don't mean sleeping like of the typical night sword.
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:10.800]   I mean of the anesthesia sword.
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:12.320]   That's the purpose of anesthesia,
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:15.240]   to bring the brain and body into a deep plane of rest,
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:16.760]   very deep, in fact.
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:20.220]   And it's very hard, if not impossible,
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:22.640]   to achieve or experience pleasure
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:26.320]   when we are in a very low state of arousal as well.
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:29.080]   When we are in heightened states of arousal,
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:32.120]   we can achieve pain, we can experience pain,
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:35.040]   and we can experience pleasure, okay?
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:37.520]   And under those heightened states of arousal,
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:41.080]   we are more sensitive, literally,
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:43.080]   the passage of electrical signals
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:46.640]   from those locations on the body that have heightened degrees
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:49.880]   or higher degrees, I should say, of receptors.
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:51.160]   Use your imagination.
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:53.560]   They include the lips, the face, the feet, and the genitals,
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:56.720]   and nearby areas, literally nearby areas.
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:01.620]   Under conditions of high arousal, two things happen.
[02:12:01.620 --> 02:12:04.040]   The ability to achieve or experience pleasure
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:05.920]   at those locations goes up,
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:09.400]   and our tolerance and our threshold for pain also goes up.
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:12.720]   So the principle here is that as our levels of arousal,
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:15.480]   that foundation of arousal goes up or down,
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:18.360]   so too goes up and down our ability
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:20.360]   to achieve pleasure and pain.
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:22.840]   And so these two extremes of being deep within anesthesia
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:26.400]   or another extreme is asleep
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:28.720]   or in heightened levels of arousal,
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:30.420]   our ability to achieve pleasure and pain
[02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:32.560]   are going to scale according to those.
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:35.220]   And this is why, and I'm certainly not suggesting this,
[02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:38.840]   but this is why some people will take stimulants
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:41.040]   or drugs of abuse that increase arousal
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:44.200]   in order to achieve pleasure of other kinds.
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:46.160]   The problem is is that those drugs,
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:48.540]   in particular things like cocaine and methamphetamine
[02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:51.920]   and amphetamine, become their own form of reinforcement,
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.100]   so much so that the person doesn't seek out
[02:12:56.100 --> 02:12:59.840]   any other form of excitement or arousal, okay?
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:02.800]   So today we weren't talking about addiction,
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:04.960]   we weren't necessarily talking about motivation,
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:06.240]   but we touched on those topics
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:08.880]   as sort of a precursor of what's to come.
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:11.720]   We talked about the pathways in the skin and in the brain
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:13.200]   and elsewhere in the body
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:14.980]   that control our sense of pleasure and pain.
[02:13:14.980 --> 02:13:16.840]   We described a number of different tools
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:19.080]   ranging from hypnosis to different supplements
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:23.340]   to electroacupuncture and various other tools
[02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:24.580]   that one could use to modulate
[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:26.700]   your sense of pleasure or pain.
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:28.900]   And of course, in thinking about pleasure,
[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.380]   we have to think about the dopamine system
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:31.400]   and the serotonin system
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:33.520]   and some of the related chemical systems.
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:35.020]   I realized that today's podcast
[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:37.540]   had a lot of scientific details.
[02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:38.960]   We've timestamped everything for you
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:42.300]   so that you don't have to digest it all at once, of course.
[02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:44.820]   I don't expect that everyone would be able to understand
[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:46.680]   all these details all at once.
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:48.760]   What's more important really
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:51.080]   is to understand the general principles
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:53.640]   of how something like pleasure and pain work,
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:56.340]   how they interact and the various cells and systems
[02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:58.720]   within the brain and body that allow them to occur
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:02.440]   and that modulate or change their ability to occur.
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:04.400]   And of course, your subjective experience
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:05.680]   of pleasure or pain.
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:08.280]   So I do hope that this was on whole
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:10.560]   more pleasureful than painful for you.
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:11.880]   If you're enjoying this podcast

[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:40.160]   There are other ways to support the podcast as well.
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:43.840]   We have a Patreon, that's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:45.720]   And there you can support the podcast
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:47.580]   at any level that you like.
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:49.460]   In addition, please check out our sponsors
[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:51.780]   that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:53.740]   We only work with sponsors and brands
[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:55.980]   that we absolutely love their products
[02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:57.600]   and that we wholeheartedly endorse
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:59.080]   and that we use ourselves.
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:01.360]   In addition, we've partnered with Thorne.
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:02.940]   Thorne is a supplement company
[02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:04.040]   and we've partnered with them
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:06.280]   because they have the highest levels of stringency
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:09.000]   in terms of the quality of the ingredients they use
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.560]   and the quantity of the ingredients they use.
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:14.100]   By quantity, I mean that unlike a lot
[02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:15.940]   of supplement companies out there,
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:18.000]   the amounts that are listed on the bottle
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.280]   are absolutely what you find in those capsules
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:22.240]   and tablets in the bottle.
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:27.240]   If you go to Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E/u/huberman,
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:30.920]   you can see the supplements that I take
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:33.800]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:36.760]   as well as any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:39.000]   Just go into the Thorne site through that portal,
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.360]   Thorne/u/huberman, and even if you navigate off
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:45.100]   from that location in the site,
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:47.840]   you'll get 20% off any of the items that you might select
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:49.880]   from other locations within the Thorne site.
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:52.440]   If you're not already following us on Instagram,
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:54.640]   it's Hubermanlab@instagram,
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:58.240]   and there I do various tutorials about neuroscience,
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:01.480]   offer neuroscience-related tools all backed by science.
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:02.880]   And last but not least,
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:04.760]   I thank you for your time and attention
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:06.800]   and thank you for your interest in science.
