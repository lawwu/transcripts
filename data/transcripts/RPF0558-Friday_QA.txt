[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:40.740]   ë…. Okay. Well, from everything that you're telling me, you're well on the past of financial independence. You have all of the basic framework in place. I'm not sure how detailed your goals are. Uh, for example, I'm not sure how much you're planning to expand your real estate portfolio, what your target numbers are, uh, how you're planning to pay down your debt or whether you're going to keep it up or, or how you're going to adjust these things. Do you have a specific question that I can, um, that you would like to home me in on that I can provide some useful insights on?
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:40.740]   I'm not sure how much you're planning to expand your real estate portfolio, what your target numbers are, how you're planning to pay down your debt or whether you're going to keep it up or how you're going to adjust these things. Do you have a specific question that I can, um, that you would like to home me in on that I can provide some useful insights on?
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:11:09.920]  , um, how about asset allocation? Um, you know, general quick, uh, gauge on, on where a person at my level should be with, uh, you know, with that mix of, of cash or, or securities or, or, um, property assets.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:09.920]   Okay. So when you use the term asset allocation, how do you believe you should structure your money?
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:19.260]   In more than one place for one, you know, I mean, um, stock market, obviously create long-term potential there, but, um, you know, we want to be aware of the risks with that.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:27.540]   And so, uh, having, let's say 400,000 there now, um, and some of that is, is, uh, highly volatile.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.360]   Let's say my company stock, which is a part of that.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:38.620]   Um, you know, so there's certain risks and things to be aware of their, uh, properties, you know, slower, uh, slower growth.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:12:09.120]   Um,
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.120]   You know, I'm a bit low on cash.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.120]   Um, you know, with around 60,000 out of that 860,000.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.120]   But just your, your thoughts would be helpful there.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.120]   So my gut would be that you're probably low on cash as well, especially given that you're managing a portfolio of five properties and your cash reserves will be partly for your own personal life, for your own personal emergency funds, um, and you're managing five properties.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:13.380]   Personal expenses, personal, uh, something happens, you need it.
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.400]   It'll be for your own personal opportunities.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.760]   If you see something you want to buy, uh, you've wanted a boat for a long time.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.480]   And now all of a sudden you came across a $70,000 boat that's selling for 30,000 bucks.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.400]   Uh, you need plenty of cash on hand.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.080]   And then of course, a big risk you have is, is managing the rental portfolios.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.540]   So my gut would be that your cash is a little bit low.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.920]   Uh, but there is no, there is no formula that I could come up with to give you.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.300]   There's no specific number.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:38.780]   There's no.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.140]   I don't know.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.140]   There's no formula that I could come up with to give you.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.140]   There's no specific number.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.140]   There's no actual number.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:13:09.160]   the cash that you're going to be spending on the rental portfolio.

[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:13.660]   "Okay, I'm willing to put my time into this.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.220]   "Okay, I'm willing to put my time into this. I'm willing to stake myself on this."
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:15.260]   I'm willing to stake myself on this."
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:31.300]  ,
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:39.460]   Now, are you specifically, do you want my comment on podcasting specifically?
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:39.500]   Now, are you specifically, do you want my comment on podcasting specifically?
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:39.540]   Now, are you specifically, do you want my comment on podcasting specifically?
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.540]   Is it too late to build a good podcast?
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:40.580]   Is it too late to build a good podcast?
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.300]   Is that what you want me to respond to?
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:41.340]   Is that what you want me to respond to?
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:41.460]   Is that what you want me to respond to?
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:41.540]   No, no, no.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:41.580]   No, no, no.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.460]   No, no, no. But I guess what I'm, where I'm coming from is the fact that I have a few different ideas.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:43.500]   No, no, no, no. But I guess what I'm where I'm coming from is the fact that I have a few different ideas.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.540]   And that's the challenge.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:45.540]   And that's the challenge.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:45.540]   And that's the challenge. You know, it's not like I have this one idea that I think the time is perfect for.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:45.540]   You know, it's not like I have this one idea that I think the time is perfect for.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:45.540]   You know, it's not like I have this one idea that I think the time is perfect for. It's that I have, you know, four or five or six different ideas.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:45.580]   It's that I have, you know, four or five or six different ideas.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:46:01.580]   It's that I have, you know, four or five or six different ideas. And I'm saying, "Okay, well, this one, the timing seems right, but I don't know if I'm quite as passionate about this other one where the timing doesn't seem right."
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:21.660]  , you know, and trying to weigh all those different factors and determine which of those should I kind of like really put my bet on first, you know?

[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:34.500]   Right. Here's my answer, and I'll give you this as kind of just my closing answer to that question because it's a good question and it's not an easy one, but here's my answer to it that I hope will help you.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:34.500]   Right. Here's my answer, and I'll give you this as kind of just my closing answer to that question because it's a good question and it's not an easy one, but here's my answer to it that I hope will help you.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.540]   Right. Here's my answer, and I'll give you this as kind of just my closing answer to that question because it's a good question and it's not an easy one, but here's my answer to it that I hope will help you.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:35.580]   A good idea is pretty much working. It's a good idea. You're not going to have to spend a lot of time trying to figure out which of those should I kind of like really put my bet on first, you know?
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:47:19.420]  , and the author's main point, or what I remember as the author's main point, what impacted me about the book was the idea that basically it all comes down to execution.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:19.600]   And if you look at somebody who is successful, especially as an entrepreneur, if you look at somebody who's effective and successful, it very, very rarely comes down to the fact that they're not going to be successful.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   And if you look at somebody who's effective and successful, it very, very rarely comes down to the fact that they're not going to be successful.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   And if you look at somebody who's effective and successful, it very, very rarely comes down to the fact that they're not going to be successful.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:28.120]   fawn to them having a good idea, and it very much comes down to their ability to actually execute on the idea that they had.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:38.240]   There are lots of people with all kinds of good ideas who never do anything with them, or who try to do something with them, and who can't accomplish them.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.800]   But it all comes down to your ability to execute.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:45.720]   I used to be scared that if I told other people my ideas, then they would steal them and run with them.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:49.620]   And now, as I've grown and I'm gaining more experience,
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:49.620]   I've become more confident in my ability to execute.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:49.620]   I've become more confident in my ability to execute.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:49.620]   I've become more confident in my ability to execute.

[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:43.060]   I work in all kinds of weird locations and I try to do that so that I can get quiet recording the recent course that I have been teaching on career and income planning was entirely recorded from underneath the pine tree and somebody who is listening very closely with their earbuds or noise can from time to time hear an airplane going off and I'm going to talk about the next one.

[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:21.000]   and so I expect this to be the norm of my life going forward for the next month
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.640]   is that I'll be in diverse locations
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:29.280]   so I have the equipment to work which is relatively simple
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.780]   I've moved entirely to a mobile recording setup
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.040]   I've done a lot of that over the years
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:40.340]   and I guess I'll skip that because that's probably only relevant to somebody who's interested in recording audio
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:40.380]   the big thing that I have found to be a big problem is that I'm not able to record audio on my own

[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:36.260]   I think it takes time. It's taking me some time, taking my family some time to get out of vacation mindset. From what I've learned from many people who've done this, if you go from going, when you go on vacation, you're accustomed to having a big difference between the structure of your home when you're home versus when you're on vacation. You may run a very orderly home when you're at home. You have regular meal times. You have regular work times. You have regular activities, regular bedtimes. You have regular work times. You have regular activities, regular bedtimes.
