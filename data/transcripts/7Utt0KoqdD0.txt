[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   one of the things that I really like about the LSB is the consistency of
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.680]   translation, so that if it uses a word that is capable of multiple synonyms in
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.280]   English, it will choose the same translation for that word in the context
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.600]   where the word appears repeatedly, so that you won't find a word in verse 5
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.480]   that's translated same word but translated differently in verse 7. When
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.660]   that happens, it's often helpful to explain to the congregation that you're
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.120]   preaching to that this is the same word in the original language. People tend to
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.380]   get confused about that. Why is it translated differently if it's the same
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.780]   word? And I think the the LSB, by being consistent with translating its words
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.560]   the same way as much as possible, has helped to decrease the amount of work
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.960]   the the preacher has to do to explain the text to his audience.
