[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   There was a bunch of controversy after COVID about masks or different kind of protocols.
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.720]   Why were we not able to deliver the one thing that was needed to arrest the pandemic as fast as possible?
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.140]   There was a political decision made that the successful administration of the vaccination was not going to be measured solely by saving lives.
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:23.400]   And so schedule 1A versus 1B versus 1C was in the first five seconds of the discussion dictated by medical necessity.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.240]   But immediately after that was about rewarding plums to politically favored groups.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.500]   You know, physical reality was there were a scarce number of vials and we needed to have a prioritization system.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.080]   And some people who urgently needed the vials were not going to get them first.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.660]   Everyone was going to get them eventually.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.420]   But the mad rush in our political system to dole out favors around the prioritization for those first vials
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.060]   exceeded the actual distribution and successful injection of the vials as a goal.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.600]   We should be outraged about this.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.720]   And we're mostly not.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.060]   Why was it extremely important to implement the tiering system?
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.900]   Because that was society's prioritization.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.420]   Was that the correct prioritization?
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.060]   Hell no!
