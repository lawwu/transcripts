[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Okay, next call is about checking her phone way too much.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   Hi, my name is Lucia.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.940]   I'm a Spanish law student and I'm
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.980]   very thankful for your student help books.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.720]   They have helped me a lot.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.620]   My question is the following.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.140]   I have gone through a digital minimalism process and deleted all my social media,
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.360]   including three Twitter accounts,
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.880]   which now sounds crazy even to me.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.920]   But I still use instant messaging apps,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.920]   and although I don't use them when I'm with other people,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.640]   whenever I'm alone, I check them a lot.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.400]   More specifically, I check them every time I pick up my phone,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.740]   be it for meditation,
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.680]   for checking my uni scheduling,
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.320]   or time in my exercise,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.600]   or any other reason.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.120]   This has come to the point where I often forget what I have picked my phone for
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.160]   originally because I get too swallowed by the messaging.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.940]   I feel like Narcissus who keeps returning to
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.460]   his reflection again and again regardless of what's better for him.
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.520]   Do you have any tips regarding this?
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.920]   Thank you so much. Rachel.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.520]   >> Well, first of all, it's been a while since we've had a good Greek reference.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.360]   So I appreciate that.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.600]   That's old school deep questions, Jessie.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.520]   Like back in the day when I would record in here,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.220]   like in the summer, and we had no video,
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.500]   and I had the AC off.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.660]   Even though it turns out having the AC on is not a problem
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.200]   because we have gated microphones and I'd just be in here sweating,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.920]   just by myself during the pandemic recording podcast episodes.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.480]   We got a little crazy with the Greek references.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.640]   So maybe you've been a moderating influence,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.700]   like people have emerged back into the world.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.140]   It's a little more reasonable, but I do appreciate the Greek reference.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.860]   So I want to apply here the digital minimalism philosophy.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.880]   Everything you talked about was things you quit or things you got rid of.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.600]   I'm glad you quit things and got rid of things,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.760]   but in some sense,
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.860]   that's not what I'm mainly interested in.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.240]   If you want to become a digital minimalist,
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.320]   what I'm interested in is your vision of the life well-lived.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.560]   What was it that you discovered when you did
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.800]   your 30-day digital declutter that really mattered to you?
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.280]   What were the things that are important to you and your life?
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.460]   Because that should be the foundation of reconstructing your digital interactions.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.640]   When you know what you want to spend your time on, what matters to you?
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.840]   What satisfies, we're going to use some more Greek references here,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.620]   your Aristotelian notion of the virtuous life, of the ethical life.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.800]   Then you can work backwards and say,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.740]   what tech helps these things?
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.020]   If I know why I'm using these texts,
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.900]   what's the right rules to put around them?
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.460]   Now, I suspect if you go through this exercise,
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.140]   you will find because you're using these instant messenger apps a lot,
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.180]   that there's people in your life that being connected to matters to you,
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.140]   that the relationships in your life matter to you,
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.500]   that you want to be a good friend,
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.100]   you want to be a good daughter,
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.580]   you want to be a good aunt,
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.780]   like whoever these people are that you're connecting to.
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.320]   You want to sacrifice non-trivial time and attention on their behalf,
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.980]   as that is what we as humans are wired to do as social beings.
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.700]   If we're not doing that, we get unhappy, we get anxious.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.420]   We start to worry about ourselves,
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.620]   we start to worry about our lives.
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.060]   That's probably what you would identify.
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.700]   If you identify that, you say, "Great.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.580]   I want to build a life when I'm doing that.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.340]   Great. What's a good way to throw tech into that picture?"
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.780]   When you ask that question,
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.260]   your answer is not going to be,
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.620]   obviously, the right use of tech to satisfy this goal is going to
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.100]   be checking instant messengers every single time I pick up my phone.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.580]   How could that possibly be the right thing there?
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.940]   No. What's the right thing going to be?
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.100]   Well, if you're really thinking this through,
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.060]   you say, "Okay. Well, first of all,
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.460]   these five people, I want to whatever,
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.140]   I want to talk to them every single week and here's when I call them,
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.300]   and I put aside a lot of time for that, and that's important.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.340]   These people, we go out and we get coffee
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.500]   every weekend because very important people to me,
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   and I go once a quarter to go see this relative of mine."
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.540]   Some of this has nothing to do with technology,
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.420]   but you're actively saying, "This is important to me.
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.020]   What do I want to do in this?"
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.180]   Then you might be saying, "Okay.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.700]   Instant messenger might be useful for talking to
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.100]   these people in other times or
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.740]   these relatives that are overseas who I can't see as much, and that's great.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.260]   But if you know that's why you're using it,
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260]   then you can say, "What rules do I want to put around that so that I can,
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.180]   in true digital minimalist fashion,
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.580]   preserve the benefit here while avoiding most of the unnecessary harms?"
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.900]   When you go through that exercise,
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.380]   you're probably going to learn, "Oh,
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.660]   I got to retrain people's expectations about how I use these services.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.300]   I probably need to step away from,
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.940]   I will be involved in ad hoc threads that are happening throughout the day."
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.780]   Now, I just got to step away from that.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.940]   It'll take people a week to adjust and then they'll get it.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.540]   I want to put aside time,
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.220]   and maybe it's at the beginning of each day over
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.900]   a lunch break where I do check in on things to see what people are talking about.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.620]   What I do there is not so much try to just jump into those conversations,
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.700]   but use the Instant Messenger to maybe set up or arrange a call or a meeting,
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.420]   use it logistically so I can see what's going on in people's lives.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.500]   But I don't think just back and forth asynchronous conversations on there,
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.680]   that doesn't count for much.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.180]   I don't feel like that's that significant.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.460]   I'm not going to spend that much time doing it.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.020]   You could just completely rethink how you use
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.700]   those tools once you know what your goal is.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.540]   If your goal is having deep, meaningful connections,
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.820]   you're not going to come away with an answer that says,
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.580]   "I should be on this all the time."
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.540]   Now, why is this important?
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.740]   Well, when you come at tool usage from the perspective of how do I
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.940]   support a vision of a life well-lived that I seriously believe in,
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.500]   changes are sustainable, and you stop using it the way you did before.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.260]   You stop checking in on all these threads,
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.420]   you stop using it as a distraction.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.420]   Why? Because you have a new way of using it that aligns with something you believe in,
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.380]   deep in your bones to be the right way to live.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.460]   That is very compelling.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.260]   Now, suddenly when you're like, "Oh,
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.340]   maybe I should pick up this phone when I have to look up a schedule,
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.660]   at uni and go to Instant Messenger."
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.500]   You're like, "If I do that,
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.460]   then I'm repudiating this whole vision I'm so excited about,
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.300]   about a life well-lived, and I don't want to repudiate that.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.140]   I want to live that life. I'm excited about it."
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.460]   So you don't check.
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.100]   That is the power of coming at digital usage from
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.860]   the perspective of supporting the positive,
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.020]   not just trying to reduce or eliminate the negative.
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.380]   That is what I'm going to suggest.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.500]   Let's give this the full digital minimalism treatment.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.340]   Solidify that picture of what matters to you,
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.500]   come up with a plan that really supports that.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.580]   Be radical about it.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.580]   Like, "Hey, I'm going to every other month
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.620]   fly to go visit this relative or whatever."
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.780]   The more radical you are,
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.740]   the more you signal to yourself you take that seriously.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.260]   But then have very specific rules about your tech inside of that picture.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.220]   I think you'll find that your digital usage is going to be greatly reduced.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.980]   I mean, the hardest thing about this,
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.100]   and Jesse, I have this in my own family,
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.100]   is the transition of not being someone who participates in threats.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.220]   Because it's basically like a binary categorization.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.540]   There's like the people you know that for whatever reason,
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.540]   will reliably participate in text or instant messenger threads.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.180]   Like if you say something, they'll come back to it.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.220]   They're always there.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.540]   It's nice because you can be in touch with that person all the time.
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.460]   But it's not sustainable.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.820]   People get used to it.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:03.140]   Like, "Okay, Jesse probably is not going to just answer back a random text right when I sent it."
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.460]   I mean, unless he happens to be doing other text messages.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.020]   People completely adjust to it.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.620]   And you know what?
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.780]   It does not hurt your relationships with people because all of that doesn't do much anyways.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.580]   If you're instead prioritizing,
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.540]   like, "How do I really talk to this person?
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.620]   I'm going to call this person every week.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.140]   I'm going to go see these people once a month."
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.700]   Then the fact that you're not at three in the afternoon
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.900]   answering the random back and forth doesn't matter.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.060]   So-
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.700]   >> You can always talk about how texting is a little bit
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.540]   different than social media too as well, right?
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.860]   >> Yeah. Yeah, because it's not the mechanics there are not someone's
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.060]   trying to steal your time.
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.020]   It's not engineered to be addictive.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.740]   The pressures there are social.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.500]   So it's a social engineering problem,
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.100]   not an attention engineering problem.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.180]   The reason why people have a hard time getting away from the texting is
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.060]   because they have configured their expectations with the people they
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.620]   know in such a way that they expect them to be reachable.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.060]   And that is very convenient.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.060]   But once you've configured those expectations,
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.900]   you're going to have to be answering texts back and forth all the time.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.980]   So like you have to completely rebuild those expectations
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.580]   of I'm not just randomly available,
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.580]   but I do see you and spend time with you a lot.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.540]   And if you need to get in touch with me,
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.940]   I'll see it at some point today and I'm reliable.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.580]   But I'm also not on my phone most of the time.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.260]   >> But no matter what social media and
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.980]   texting are still context switching if you're in deep work.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.820]   >> Well, yeah, that's the problem. It has the same cost.
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.260]   Yeah. So the social media is bringing in you because there's
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.900]   a neural net app that is
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.700]   selecting things to show you the press your brain stem.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.140]   You're like, "Man, I got to look at that."
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.660]   Context switch, you're in trouble.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.780]   Texting has none of that,
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.060]   but it's still very powerful because if there's
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.580]   a social expectation that you have established that I will answer.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.300]   And now the person you know is sending you a quick question.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.620]   Like, "Well, I got to keep checking because it's a problem if I don't answer."
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.620]   And then you have the same cost.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.980]   >> Yeah. Actually, I want to ask you this question about texting.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.540]   Because a lot of times, like say,
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.700]   you have a note or something that you want to text somebody,
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.540]   you might write that down when you're in like a deep work session or whatever.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:58.860]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.700]   >> Then like say that that session's over,
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.860]   you go to text the person,
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.660]   then you read another text and you forget about it.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.180]   There's really no way to,
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.900]   well, I've figured out one way.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.020]   If you just close your texting interface and you pull everybody up by
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.060]   the contacts and you can text them directly.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.340]   >> Right.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.660]   >> But otherwise, like you can't,
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.740]   you're always going to see the main page of the texting.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.540]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.140]   >> So then what, you're saying the issue is if you want to like hold on to-
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.900]   >> You get distracted because like you say you go,
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.740]   you want to text Elon Musk about coming on your podcast.
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:29.900]   >> Right.
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.060]   >> Then you're going to go there and you see
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.860]   Mark Zuckerberg asked you to go to get drinks for happy hours.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.300]   >> You sigh like, "Oh, Mark."
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.060]   >> Such expectations for accessibility.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.140]   >> Then you forget to invite Elon on the thing
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.780]   because you sent Mark the response or whatever.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.380]   >> Do you ever think about that or do you have a way around that?
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.580]   >> I mean, yeah. I mean, I think it's the problem.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.620]   Like text messages are very convenient,
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.220]   but it's the problem of using that as like the primary way.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.940]   Or like where they're useful is I'm meeting you.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.740]   I'm coming to meet you and we have to,
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.980]   "Hey, I'm five minutes late."
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.060]   Or like I'll text you if I'm coming over here and like every single week I'm late.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.900]   I'll be like, "I'm late or here's what's going on."
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.140]   It's logistical, it's helping us like coordinate.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.860]   We're about to get together.
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.340]   It works fine for that or you're like,
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.460]   "Hey, why aren't you here? I'm at the bar."
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.500]   Or something like that. But when it's,
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.860]   I get these type of things a lot and I don't like it where it says like,
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.700]   "Someone randomly texted me during the day."
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.620]   Yeah, and there's like an obligation in it and like,
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.500]   "What about this?" Or, "Can you let me know when you're available for whatever?"
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.980]   I'm like, "Exactly this issue."
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.740]   How am I going to, this is going to be lost in
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.940]   the string full of all these other texts from all these other people.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.220]   How am I going to remember?
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.500]   Like typically what I try to do is immediately if I
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.100]   see something like that get into my capture system.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.180]   Like right away, I get them like, "Yeah,
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.300]   I think it's a huge problem."
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:45.820]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.340]   >> Like texting, text interfaces are not invented for a world in
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.860]   which there could be dozens of people spontaneously,
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.420]   like that you're engaged in conversations with anyone of
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.340]   which could involve obligations being introduced for you.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:58.820]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.220]   >> Completely asynchronous and outside of your control.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.460]   >> I found a workaway, I use an Android.
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.020]   So if you go to the contacts page on the Android and you pull up like Mark's cell phone.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.340]   >> It will show only their text?
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.660]   >> You can text them through that interface.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.380]   >> That's smart.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.420]   >> And then, so if you're disciplined about it,
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.820]   you go to the texting page but you're beyond
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.300]   Mark's individual profile where you're texting him.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.220]   And then as long as you do that.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.580]   >> Yeah, that's interesting. That's smart.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.460]   Okay, so you pull up the contact and then it can just be.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:26.980]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.660]   >> So like if you and I are talking like right before a recording session,
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.540]   we could be just seeing each other.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.020]   Like I could just be seeing you.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.380]   >> It brings it over to the other one.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.620]   But if I just know that I needed to text you,
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.020]   then I could just go into the contact,
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.620]   grab you and text you and I wouldn't be distracted by other texts.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.580]   >> Right. If you need to send something. Oh, so outbound.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:44.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.300]   >> Yeah. It's a good fix.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.740]   Yeah. I mean, that's a hard one. People have a hard time with that.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.340]   And again, I think it's all just,
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.140]   it's expectations because it's a problem.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.500]   Once the expectation is set, it's true.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.900]   You can't just stop using it.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.500]   Like I think that is harder than people leaving social media.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.260]   People think it's going to be hard to leave social media because people
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.820]   imagine there's these big audiences that care but they don't.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.300]   And no one notices when you leave and it's kind of embarrassing.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.900]   Text messaging people notice when you change your habit.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:17.100]   Right? So like, if you're on Twitter and you quit Twitter, no one cares.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.180]   Like no one, because you were just being
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.740]   algorithmically thrown in the feeds with other stuff and no one knows.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.100]   It's all dehumanized and depersonalized and who cares.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.300]   But if like your brother stops responding to text,
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.980]   but he always had reliably been doing that,
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.660]   then that's like, oh my God, like people you know.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.940]   Like it's way more.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.780]   I learned that working on digital minimalism and working with
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.660]   people that are going through the process of the declutter.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.380]   It's way more like personal and fraught changing your text habits or
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.380]   instant messenger habits than it is changing your social media habits.
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.700]   Maybe I should just get my text,
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.540]   my phone number out to our listeners.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.860]   So they can just text you?
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.500]   Just text me.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.140]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.500]   That would go well. I don't mind.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.180]   All right. Where are we at?
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.900]   Oh no. I'm going to speed up now.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:06.060]   I always say 45 minutes and we've never been under like 57 minutes.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.220]   Well, I think there's always value in the episode.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:08.980]   That's true.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.180]   Your audience wants to hear you.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:10.620]   That's true.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.460]   Jive on stuff.
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:11.900]   I hear you.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
