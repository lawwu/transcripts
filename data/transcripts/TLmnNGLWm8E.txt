[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   First, the people who are open to understand that change will be necessary.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.960]   And change not in a way that you're changing your factory,
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.120]   because the whole point of having our AMR solution is
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.360]   we don't put markers on your objects, we don't put any markers on the ground,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.920]   we don't have any reflectors for localization,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.960]   we just deploy our robot itself on your ground.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.760]   So that's also one of the selling points, I would say,
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.840]   which helps customers look at the robot in terms of a more positive approach.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.280]   So you have logistics experts looking at the process and saying,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.120]   "Here's where a robot would make sense to integrate."
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.480]   Those kinds of transports can be automated by a robot.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.680]   So in this way, you did increase efficiency,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.680]   not by removing one task and saying, "Okay, that's the robot, it's doing it,"
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.880]   but by re-architecting how you're just moving
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.640]   or efficiently working inside the factory itself.
