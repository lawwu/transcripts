[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   There are scholarships for the C student.
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.360]   It's a different game than the Rockstar,
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.880]   which is a different game than, you know,
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.040]   I have a lot of parents say, "My student's fantastic.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.800]   "He gets mostly A's and B's."
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.360]   Okay, that's one version of fantastic.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.360]   Okay, the next version is, "Well, my kid's fantastic.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.080]   "He's gonna be fourth in his class,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.200]   "or he's gonna be the valedictorian."
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.080]   And then there's the next level of fantastic,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.100]   which is, "My kid's been taking math
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.640]   "at the local college since fourth grade."
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.200]   Sheldons of the world, for those of you
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.920]   that Big Bang kind of stuff, right?
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.000]   So there's all these different levels of fantastic.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.280]   Depending on where you land,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.720]   that helps determine where you're going
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.920]   and what makes sense.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.320]   But if you want to get into MIT astrophysics,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.360]   it's a lot different than getting into
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.200]   many state universities that aren't really known
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.040]   for their astrophysics.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.200]   Or if you want to be a performing artist
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.240]   and you want to be at NYU's Tisch Performing Arts Center
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.640]   right near Broadway versus, again,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.180]   And the local community college also has a theater program.
