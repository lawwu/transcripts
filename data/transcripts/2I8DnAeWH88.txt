[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Well, we love to get questions
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.440]   on basic Bible interpretation,
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.920]   so much of what we do in helping you read your Bible.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.760]   So please keep sending those questions into us.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.400]   Today's question is from Deborah from Kalamazoo, Michigan.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.380]   Hello, Pastor John, I've heard you talk about arcing.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.000]   Can you explain to me the very basics of what arcing does
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.080]   and what we can learn from this practice?
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.080]   This is my introduction to it,
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.840]   so the simpler, the better.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.640]   And if you have one simple example to explain it all,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.240]   that would be great.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.960]   Pastor John, what would you say to Deborah?
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.480]   - I would love to.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.120]   So let me try to be simple,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.520]   because at root, it is simple.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.000]   Arcing is a way of taking a paragraph of Scripture,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.200]   a unit of Scripture, let's just say a paragraph,
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.720]   breaking it down into individual statements,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.160]   seeing how each of those statements
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.760]   relate to each other logically.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.620]   Like is one the cause of the other?
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.680]   Is one the result of the other?
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.120]   Does one explain the other?
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.440]   So seeing the relationships
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.160]   and then putting all those statements together
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.840]   according to those relationships
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.880]   so that we can see the one main thing
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.560]   that the paragraph is saying
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.560]   and how each of those individual parts of the paragraph,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.920]   those statements, work to support it and explain it.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.540]   And then arcing provides a way of preserving
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.580]   what we've seen with a kind of drawing of the text,
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.940]   each statement having an arc
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.540]   and each relationship having a symbol.
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.440]   And so when you're done, you can file it away
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.420]   and remember everything you've seen
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.100]   next time you wanna study the passage.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.780]   There's nothing really mysterious about it.
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.500]   We talk this way, we talk this way all the time,
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.040]   especially when we're trying to be clear
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.380]   and trying to explain something to somebody.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.140]   We try to make a point,
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.440]   then we say other things about the point
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.540]   to explain it or support it.
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.420]   We do this instinctively.
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.280]   We manage to communicate pretty well from day to day.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.360]   And what arcing does is force us
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.020]   to think about what we're doing
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.620]   and what the biblical writers are doing
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.620]   just as a way of making sure that we don't miss anything
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.700]   that they're trying to show us.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.200]   The great value of arcing is mainly,
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.700]   it forces us to just look and look and look at the text
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.240]   and think and think about it.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.420]   Paul said in 2 Timothy 2.7,
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.460]   "Think over what I say
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.680]   and the Lord will give you understanding."
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.520]   So in order to get the fullest meaning out of a passage,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.040]   we have to look at it carefully and in detail
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.760]   and think about it.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.340]   And then we need to construct the argument,
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.200]   reconstruct it in our heads or on paper
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.840]   and write it down lest we forget it.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.040]   So here's the example of,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.840]   so you get the idea.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.760]   Romans 1, verses 15 through 17.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.080]   Here's what it says.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.680]   "I am eager to preach the gospel
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.380]   to you also who are in Rome,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.560]   for I'm not ashamed of the gospel,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.680]   for it is the power of God and the salvation
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.560]   to everyone who believes to the Jew first
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.920]   and also to the Greek,
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.020]   for in it the righteousness of God
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.520]   is revealed from faith to faith."
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.000]   So there are four statements here
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.620]   and Paul clues us into how they're related
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.720]   by the connecting words that he uses.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.640]   In this case, it happens to be four, F-O-R, four, four, four.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.240]   So each of those statements gets an arc.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.040]   So you get four arcs.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.600]   And we're trying to decide what's the main point,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.660]   not necessarily the most important reality,
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.160]   but the main point that is the conclusion,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.480]   what everything else is supporting here.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.560]   So let's walk through these four propositions
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.120]   and see if we can reconstruct the argument.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.000]   "I am eager to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome."
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.560]   That's statement number one.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.020]   Here's statement number two.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.880]   "For," or because,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.060]   and so here comes the support or the ground,
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.320]   "because I'm not ashamed of the gospel."
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.100]   So one of the reasons he wants to preach the gospel in Rome
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.100]   is that he's not ashamed of the gospel at all.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.760]   And then comes the third statement,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   which is given as a support or an argument or a basis
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.300]   for why he's not ashamed of the gospel.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.840]   "I am not ashamed of the gospel
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.720]   because it is the power of God
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.600]   and the salvation to everyone who believes."
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.820]   That's the third statements.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.220]   So now we have three statements
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.100]   and the last two are the arguments
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.500]   for the first one.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.600]   And if we say it in reverse order,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.540]   we can hear it even more clearly.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.180]   When you go in reverse order,
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.840]   a because becomes a therefore.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.440]   "The gospel is the power of God
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.900]   and the salvation for everyone who believes.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.540]   Therefore, I'm not ashamed of it at all.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.700]   Therefore, I am eager to preach the gospel to you
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.580]   who are in Rome."
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.740]   And then there's one last important statement,
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.660]   one more piece in the argument in verse 17.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.300]   He gives the reason or the basis,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.940]   the argument for why the gospel is the power of God
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.700]   and the salvation to everyone who believes.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.160]   He says, "For, or because in it,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.900]   the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith."
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.420]   So Paul is giving a three-step argument
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.380]   rooted in the very nature of the gospel
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.360]   for why he is so eager to preach the gospel
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.100]   in Rome.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.860]   So I'll read it in reverse order
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.420]   so that you can hear how the argument works.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.100]   "In the gospel, God's righteousness is revealed
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.180]   as a saving righteousness that is counted to us
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.580]   through faith."
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.980]   That's the first statement.
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.600]   "Therefore, this gospel is the power of God
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.740]   for the worst of sinners, Jew or Greek,
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.900]   through faith, whoever believes."
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.140]   Here's the third statement.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.240]   "Therefore, I'm not ashamed of the gospel."
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.380]   Last statement.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.180]   "Therefore, I'm eager to preach the gospel
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.260]   to you who are in Rome."
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.780]   So that's basically what we do in arching.
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.420]   We take a unit of scripture
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.460]   and we identify individual statements.
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.180]   Then we identify the relationships between those statements
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.020]   and then we rebuild the argument
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.180]   so that we can see what the main point is.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.460]   What's the one thing he's trying to support
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.420]   with all the other statements.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.780]   And I promise you, this is a promise.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.060]   I promise you that if you begin to think about passages
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.900]   of scripture this way,
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.900]   you will not only see vastly more of what's really there
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.940]   that you might've missed,
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.900]   but your confidence level that you have seen God's truth
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.700]   will dramatically increase.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.980]   And if God is willing, and I think he is willing,
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.020]   you will go very deep with him
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.980]   and you will know him as you've never known him before.
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.660]   - Amen.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.140]   These are such critical skills for reading comprehension
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.700]   with scripture and really with anything.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.380]   But thank you, Pastor John, for outlining these principles.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.940]   Please keep sending in your Bible interpretation questions.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.460]   It's one of the major themes on our brains right now.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.300]   And really all the time we're thinking about these things.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.820]   Pastor John's latest book, of course,
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.580]   is titled "Reading the Bible Supernaturally."
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.700]   You'll wanna check it out.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.100]   And there's a really helpful guide to arcing
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.020]   as an appendix in that book.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.380]   If you want a more visual representation
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.180]   of the principles explained here today,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.260]   that's a great place to begin.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.460]   And of course, if you want more examples
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.140]   and if you want more help with arcing,
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.620]   check out the web resource, biblearc.com.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.500]   B-I-B-L-E-A-R-C.com, biblearc.com.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.940]   A lot of great resources there.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.740]   Well, it seems if we read our New Testaments correctly,
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.500]   that Jesus said that his return was going to be soon.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.900]   So where is he?
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.340]   And why is the church still waiting for his return?
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.620]   That question is on the table Wednesday.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.460]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.660]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.980]   We'll see you then.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.180]   (upbeat music)
