[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.840]   pre-summarization of the law is not a good thing. It's a little bit more expensive than the law. It's not a good thing to do. It's a little bit more expensive than the law. And hopefully that will help you to fare a little bit better. See, a lot of this type of planning is defensive risk management planning. It's insurance planning. But it's not about buying an insurance policy. It's about the things that you can do to prepare yourself for when everything goes wrong. Things go wrong in everybody's life. But depending on our level of preparation for those things, the impact is different.

[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.280]   And there are various ways to do that.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.400]   You can do it with an all out practice and a rehearsal.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.520]   So that's what people in those difficult and stressful environments will do is they'll rehearse again and again physically rehearse.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.980]   But you can also do it just mentally.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:09.600]   You can just think through some things and at least having thought through something will make it much more likely that everything's going to be fine.

Now, of course, I'm no, nothing special, but just thinking of it in advance is my point. It'll help you to it. And being laid off or being fired is a tough situation. I remember very keenly what it was like to be laid off. It was, it's emotionally devastating. It's tough because it attacks your self-confidence.

It'll probably upset you, but hopefully it'll only last for a couple of days. The emotional upset if you get laid off will hopefully only last for a couple of days instead of for weeks or months. Because months are devastating.

[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   It's happened to many people. On the other hand, if you're accustomed to making say half a million dollars a year and you have a few hundred thousand dollars in cash that's just sitting there in liquid accounts, then having a $2000 a month boat payment is probably not going to wipe you out. But on the other hand, if you are highly leveraged and have a lot of monthly payments, no matter how you're going to be able to pay for it.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   I think that's probably not going to wipe you out. But on the other hand, if you are highly leveraged and have a lot of monthly payments, no matter how you're going to pay for it.

[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:46.720]   My wife and I watched it on Netflix some months ago and it was fascinating, absolutely fascinating.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.620]   It tells the story of a couple named

[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.120]   What do you think of the mortgage industry? I think of the mortgage industry as a good example. In the past in 2008, I was a financial advisor and or 2009, basically. And I remember meeting with a lot of people in the mortgage business and just watching them as their industry was imploding. And they had levered their lifestyle up.

[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.740]   That way it's there and it's available to you if you need it.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.340]   You don't have to answer the income questions at that point in time.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.900]   You've already established it.

[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:57.340]   I'm sure you've got a lot of credit cards available to you before you get laid off so that they're there if or when you ever need them.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:57.380]   Now obviously you need to consider carefully if you can trust yourself.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:57.460]   If you have a problem with compulsive spending it'll probably save you money to not have the credit cards even available to you.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:57.500]   But if you are a normal disciplined person it might be helpful to you to have those things available because when you need the money to keep the credit cards in place.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:57.540]   Because when you need the money to keep the credit cards in place.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:57.660]   you need the credit cards in place.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.700]   when you need the credit cards in place.

[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.900]   If you have a defined benefit pension, those are less simple.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:08.900]   There's not a lot that you can do here to change it, but at least have a general idea of what would happen.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:16.900]   One of the things that I forgot about when I was laid off back in 2008 was that I wasn't fully vested in my 401 s employer contributions.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.900]   So I forfeited the employer contributions because I wasn't fully vested.
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.900]   Now, there wasn't a lot I could do about that, but it did impact my financial life.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.900]   Give these things some thought.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.360]   And if you see any holes or holes in the
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:29.360]   financial life, give these things some thought.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:29.360]   And if you see any holes or holes in the financial life, give these things some thought.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:29.360]   And if you see any holes or holes in the financial life, give these things some thought.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:29.360]   And if you see any holes or holes in the financial life, give these things some thought.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:58.400]   in your plans and start affecting them and start plugging the holes.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.400]   And if you see any holes or any problems in your plans and start affecting them and start plugging the holes.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:36:59.400]   Now overall, the major thing to focus on and here's where we get out of the specific weeds of finance. The major things to focus on is the plan of getting your next job as quickly as possible. And there are a few things that you can be doing to prepare for that. Now, many of these things are things you should be doing anyway so that you don't get laid off. That's the beautiful thing.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:29.420]   I emphasize yesterday. All of those things that I mentioned in yesterday's show will help you to keep from getting laid off but they'll also make you more employable and improve your chances of getting another job. You ever noticed how the people for whom things go well, it seems like things always go well and they always get more and more opportunities? And then some people it seems like nothing seems to go well, nothing seems to go well, nothing seems to go well and it just gets worse and worse? Now, there may be many reasons for that. Some of those things are within their control.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:29.440]   and they always get more and more opportunities. And then some people it seems like nothing seems to go well, nothing seems to go well, nothing seems to go well, and it just gets worse and worse? Now, there may be many reasons for that. Some of those things are within their control.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   Now, there may be many reasons for that. Some of those things are within their control.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:59.480]   and some of those things are outside of their control. But you can tilt the odds in your favor with good proper prior planning. And this type of approach will help you from getting laid off because you should be looking for your next job or next opportunity regardless. Not necessarily actively all the time out beating the streets and applying for jobs but keeping your ears open. One of the key things you can do is keep yourself light
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.520]   and flexible financially.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:08.520]   Simple example, one of the benefits to renting is you can move across the country or across the world on relatively short notice.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520]   and flexible financially.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.520]   and flexible financially.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.520]   One of the biggest challenges of 2008 and 2009,

[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.520]   but that the jobs were in a place that was different than many of the workers.

[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:38.060]   I was coming in as a small-time business consultant.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:42.060]   My employer thought I was coming in as a front desk worker.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:46.060]   I don't know how we got such bad communication.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.360]   It should have been obvious.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   It was pretty obvious within a couple of weeks that it wasn't a great fit.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   A few weeks into it, all of a sudden we realized this isn't working and both of us mutually agreed to call it off.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   As I left that job, I needed to get out of the office.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   I needed to get out of the office.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   I needed to get out of the office.

[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:47.840]   I needed to get out of the office.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:47.900]   I needed to get out of the office.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:47.940]   I needed to get out of the office.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:41:17.400]   I needed to get out of the office.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:17.440]   I needed to get out of the office.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:17.460]   I needed to get out of the office.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:17.480]   I needed to get out of the office.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:17.500]   I needed to get out of the office.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:17.540]   I needed to get out of the office.
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:17.560]   I needed to get out of the office.

[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:17.640]   to get out of the office.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.440]   to just do a good job.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.960]   Because those times,
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.300]   I really needed those jobs.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.700]   That wasn't $200,000 a year
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:26.800]   fancy professional jobs.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.320]   That's different.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.500]   But still, when you need a job,
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.180]   you need a job,
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.260]   and it makes a big difference.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.660]   In my mind,
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.120]   one of the biggest things
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:35.840]   that can be helpful
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.940]   as you make plans
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.080]   of what you would do
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.400]   in case you get laid off
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.000]   is to see yourself now
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.920]   as a business owner.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.480]   Because practically speaking,
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.240]   you are a business owner.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:47.300]   You are a business owner.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:47.360]   You are a business owner.
