[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300]   If you can go to that one place where you think you,
[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.200]   whether it's your mom or dad or best friend or spouse,
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.340]   where you're like, "Hey, I'm actually starting a journey
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.580]   "of self-awareness and I know that I've always been
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.340]   "the kind of person that can get very defensive
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.240]   "or it can lead to a fight, or you just love me so much
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.820]   "you don't want to hurt my feelings, but no bullshit.
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.700]   "Can you just answer a couple questions for me?
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.640]   "You know how everybody says I have all this talent?
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.100]   "Am I lazy?"
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.620]   If you can get a person that loves you
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.900]   to a place where they'll tell you the truth,
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.460]   you can really start to unlock some conversations
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.720]   that can give you some affirmation
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.620]   on something you've been fighting off.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.460]   - Hello, and welcome to All The Hacks,
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.180]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.460]   Now, many of you might already know Gary Vaynerchuk,
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.080]   but the conversation we have might surprise you.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.860]   While he might be best known for his hustle
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.480]   and savvy in entrepreneurship,
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.860]   I want to focus on a side of Gary
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.520]   you might not have seen before.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.520]   But having known Gary for over a decade,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.300]   I think it might actually be more a part
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.500]   of who he really is than anything else.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.260]   That's a conversation about kindness
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.500]   and happiness and self-awareness.
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.460]   We'll talk about ways to transform your life
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.020]   by digging deep into the importance of kindness
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.660]   and making amends with people,
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.340]   and how you can use self-awareness as a superpower,
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.500]   some important life lessons to instill in your kids,
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.780]   and a lot more.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.300]   And before diving in, if you could give us a thumbs up,
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.740]   it'd really help the algorithm.
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.340]   And if you're new here, please consider subscribing.
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.540]   All right, let's do it.
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.940]   - Gary, thanks for being here.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.940]   - Are we rolling?
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.180]   - Okay.
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.420]   Gary, thanks for having me here.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.260]   - Thanks for having me on your show, brother.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.900]   - Yeah, yeah, it's good to be in this office.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.960]   So many people that I told I was coming to chat with you
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.420]   associate you with hustle.
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.540]   What are they getting wrong when they make that assumption?
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.780]   - The nuances of it, right?
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.520]   Like, yes, I believe in work ethic.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.260]   I think it's a variable.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.440]   But I don't think it's as,
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.280]   it kind of reminds me
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.040]   of what's just kind of going on in the world, right?
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.400]   We're so into headline reading.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.440]   I think there was a couple of viral posts
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.880]   on Medium written about me on hustle porn,
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.720]   and that kind of like cemented a point of view
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.200]   that even the writer of that article,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.800]   three years later, DM me to apologize,
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.840]   because he spoke to the agenda he had at hand,
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.200]   and realized he was making certain variables convenient
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.600]   to the story he was trying to tell.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.240]   And I really appreciated that, by the way.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.440]   I think that takes a lot of humility and courage.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.200]   And honestly, I really do love the idea
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.480]   of understanding that work ethic is a variable,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.920]   but there's so many other variables.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.240]   Like, for example, from the first book I wrote, "Crushing,"
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.940]   when I wrote it in 2008 and came out in '09,
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.240]   in that exact book, there's like,
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.960]   hey, if you work nine to five,
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.560]   and you make $48,000 a year, you've won if you're thrilled,
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.200]   if you live within your means and you're super happy.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   And so I think what people get wrong is,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.440]   I'm excited and I enjoy what I do,
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.400]   and I put in hours towards it,
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   but it doesn't define me.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   I'm completely, utterly detached
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.800]   from financial success, from notoriety.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.100]   I just love my game.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.840]   The people that know me best know the same vigor I talk
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.160]   about like, hey, you can have a career that you love,
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.400]   I bring that same vigor to 6 a.m. on a Saturday
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.200]   to go garage sailing 'cause I love it,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.880]   or competing in basketball or pickleball,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.360]   or watching a Jets game.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   I think what they get wrong is,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.800]   unlike a lot of people who don't even use that word
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.320]   or even deploy that energy,
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.840]   I have tons of friends who are seemingly calm,
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.800]   speak all the right speak for acceptance,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.540]   but are absolutely, incredibly overly driven
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.200]   by money, by fame, and are detached to that
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.160]   and I think that's why there's a lot of anxiety
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.980]   in the world.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.480]   And so I think the nuances of how I think about it,
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.120]   plus I also spoke about that concept
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.540]   during an incredibly down market in the economy,
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.000]   when the internet was hitting an incredible inflection point
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.120]   in 2008, '09, '10.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.640]   So I think just the nuance of it,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.400]   the word, when I use the word hustle in 2008, '09, '10,
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.480]   the intent is like, hey, there's opportunity
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.920]   and you can go get it.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.600]   I'm thrilled to change that word to tenacity,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.640]   or grit, or work ethic.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.400]   So I think the semantics of it all.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   And I am a communicator that I'm incredibly self-aware
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.520]   that the way I communicate with the excitement level,
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.960]   with the energy, with the Jersey chat of it,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.560]   I'm very aware and genuinely compassionate
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.000]   and understanding to why people may take the extreme take.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.060]   And I also don't have the audacity.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.080]   I deploy enormous humility when I'm about to say
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.180]   what I'm saying.
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.160]   I would never expect someone to spend five hours
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.320]   to double click into it and actually understand
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.520]   what I'm about and what I'm saying.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.800]   And so I guess at the end of the day, what are they missing?
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.120]   They're not missing anything if they're just doing a drive by
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.720]   and reading a headline.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.040]   If they've spent two or three hours on me through content
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.160]   or interaction or people that really know me,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.800]   I doubt they'd be missing anything
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.520]   'cause I think they would contextualize it.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.360]   - Yeah.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.320]   Do you think that work ethic you have, that grit,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.840]   that tenacity is something that can be taught or learned,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.140]   or is it just something that's part of your DNA?
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.380]   - I think it's a combination of both.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.720]   I think it's clearly in people's DNA.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.520]   There's many people that are either born with too little
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.080]   or too much that deploy it immediately
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.540]   to quote unquote prove something or see an opportunity,
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.760]   especially for immigrants.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.520]   It's so easy for me to go at it.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.240]   I was born in the Soviet Union.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.320]   My parents lived their entire childhood
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.600]   and into their early 20s there.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.240]   So I lived in a household that really understood,
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.920]   like shit, man, America's pretty epic.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.760]   This is pretty cool.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   You don't go to jail for trying to make a better life
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.520]   for yourself in entrepreneurship.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.940]   So it was very easy for me.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.060]   On the flip side, I've seen a lot of people
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.980]   be affected by the osmosis of work ethic.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.600]   It's kind of like what's going on with me in the gym.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.400]   It became so not natural.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.020]   As natural as it comes to me to sell lemonade
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.740]   or sports cards or run businesses or be nice to people,
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.760]   it comes equally not natural to me to work in the gym.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.660]   But we've known each other a long time.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.720]   Somewhere around 38, I decided to put in the work
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.960]   'cause I wanted to live longer
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.620]   and just thought it would be better.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.680]   And through osmosis practice,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.180]   I'm now someone who goes to the gym.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.220]   I still don't love it, which is why I really do talk about
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.940]   how important passion is to actually get to that state
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.940]   where it's so easy 'cause you love it so much.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.380]   I really do wish for everyone that the job they had
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.400]   was similar to their favorite hobby.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.620]   For everybody right now who's listening,
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.420]   they can take a step back and whether it's skiing
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.220]   or cooking or playing video games
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.060]   or sailing or garage sailing
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.460]   or watching movies or what have you,
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.620]   if they could do that 24/7 and sustain their life,
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.720]   a lot of people would be happier and would enjoy that.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.500]   But on the flip side, for a lot of us,
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.800]   just like me for the gym,
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.420]   sometimes you have to put in that work
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.580]   if you want to accomplish something that you think is good.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.900]   To me, I'm actually very focused on people
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.260]   living within their means versus creating frameworks
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.940]   that require them to work harder, to make more money,
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.180]   to live within the means that they think
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.300]   they need to live in.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.740]   I don't think you need a BMW.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.300]   I don't think you need a six-bedroom house
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.100]   and I think that is where that conversation
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.100]   gets interesting but at the end of the day,
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.180]   I think it is something that can be taught
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.900]   but I don't think it's something that can be taught
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.100]   in this scenario.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.660]   I've gotten better at basketball even in the last year.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.340]   I've put in more work.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.940]   I'm not an NBA player.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.820]   So I think there is a level of DNA
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.180]   that caps out everyone in every genre
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.580]   but I think the capacity to get better in everything
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.860]   is quite high.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.980]   Like I can't sing for a lick.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.740]   I have a feeling if I got a voice coach
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.820]   and really put in the work
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.840]   and like worked on it for a decade,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.820]   like I think I would be better at karaoke than I am now
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.080]   and so that's interesting to me,
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.940]   the things you can control versus the things that you can't.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.700]   - So I'm guessing you don't wanna sing
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.660]   which is why you haven't done that
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.420]   but you did wanna build--
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.100]   - So I have a new song out with Snoop.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.900]   Everyone go check out, it's not a joke.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.260]   Go check out on Spotify.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.140]   Please take a step back, Snoop Dogg and Gary Vee.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.700]   17-year-old me is still freaking the fuck out.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.140]   - But you did wanna work out.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.980]   - Yes. - You said you're 38.
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.820]   I'm 38.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.420]   I don't have a great fitness regime.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.660]   You know, was it just putting in the work
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.180]   or are there things you did that made it more possible?
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.860]   - I think I was also in a five-year window
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.460]   where I was really hitting it hard,
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.900]   traveling a lot, going hard.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.620]   I was really enjoying it but I did recognize like hmm,
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.020]   like this is really like not sustainable.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.140]   Like I don't think I have good eating habits.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.100]   I have great mental habits.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.060]   I'm incredibly calm and happy.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.460]   I sleep, the hustle thing that always makes me laugh
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.340]   is like I sleep six, seven, eight, nine hours a night
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.540]   depending on the night.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.580]   So I have good sleeping.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.940]   I have good lack of anxiety
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.740]   because I am detached from the work stress
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.460]   but I knew that my eating and muscles were nowhere
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.740]   and so my back had been hurt as a child
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.460]   working in my dad's liquor store.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.540]   So like that was something I wanted to fix
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.540]   'cause it was really uncomfortable
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.620]   and back to like kid's life,
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.860]   you start like not wanting to carry your kid
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.100]   'cause you're worried your back goes out.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.700]   Little simple things like taking luggage off of the top
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.140]   of like a plane and like having to use your right side
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.300]   'cause you're scared your left side will go out.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.600]   There was these little nagging things.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.260]   My neck, you know, like would get stiff at times.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.140]   I was like, well, I'm way too young for all this
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.740]   and I plan on like really quote unquote going hard.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.820]   I mean, I enjoy what I do.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.900]   I'd like to be 65 and fly somewhere for a meeting
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.780]   or, you know, and so, you know, for me,
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.040]   I just said, I've got to do this.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.940]   This is very clear.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.080]   Like there are certain things that are just very clear.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.580]   Back to how we started this.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.060]   Like work ethic is one of the variables
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.120]   that helps somebody build something meaningful, right?
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.360]   Well, you know, eating well and going to the gym
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.780]   like genuinely gives you a higher propensity
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.220]   of like having a longer life and a more enjoyable life
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.580]   in your 60s, 70s, and 80s.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.900]   So it was just a very logical conversation.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.480]   I also got to the financial place
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.900]   where I was able to hire a babysitter
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.060]   and the big unlock for me was I'm not accountable to myself,
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.700]   I'm accountable to others.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.540]   The reason I think I'm a very good boss,
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.660]   the reason I think I'm a good friend
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.700]   is like I like being there for people.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.860]   For my own self, I just kind of take it for granted.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.940]   I like, I don't want to like beat my own record
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.940]   on how much I, how fast I ran or how much iron I pumped.
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:05.660]   So by hiring Mike Vacanti to be my full-time babysitter
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.880]   and like the person I was accountable to,
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.660]   it really worked for me.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.820]   And it's what I'm still doing 10 years later.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.640]   - It's funny, the sharp decline in my exercise happened
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.140]   when Kevin Rose stopped riding the Peloton
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.460]   because we had this fierce competition of like,
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.140]   I'm gonna be, I didn't care about beating my record,
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.300]   I cared about beating his record
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.780]   and he cared about beating my record
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.700]   and then he kind of like gave it up and I lost.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.020]   - I think that's a huge insight for you.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.860]   I think you can replicate that.
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.580]   You've got other Kevin Roses in your life,
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.340]   you can find a Kevin Rose on Twitter right now.
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.060]   And so I think that's epic.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.300]   And by the way, same with me,
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.540]   like who I am on a basketball court or a tennis court,
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.540]   the level of effort and work I put on in that environment
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.700]   versus what I do in the gym is like 10 to five.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.340]   Like 10 on the court, five in the gym.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.540]   So I understand that and I think that that's something
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.620]   you should try to figure out.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.460]   - Yeah, I got some ideas.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.580]   - Good.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.300]   By the way, anybody who's listening to this podcast,
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.020]   just hit up Chris and like be like,
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.860]   I'll be your Kevin Rose.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.700]   - Yeah, just get on the leaderboard.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.520]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.060]   - I wanna push, like we would basically be like,
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.380]   let's push until we might throw up on this bicycle.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.820]   - By the way though, building this podcast,
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.340]   which you have care for 'cause you put a lot of effort
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.020]   to making this date work and I appreciate your tenacity
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.620]   and I apologize that my schedule is the worst,
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.340]   I'm so pumped we're here and it's always great to see you.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.580]   You're such a good dude.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.340]   I think you should build the community of this podcast.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.420]   I think you should get, I guarantee you,
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.940]   73 of your listeners right now are fired up right now
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.620]   and you can build a whole community on this.
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.060]   - Yeah, so we, it's funny,
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.780]   we haven't had the conversation about this,
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.100]   but we launched a membership.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.100]   There's like 150 people right now, actively,
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.380]   starting a book club, like in the city.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.820]   - In this membership, 39 of that 150 or 150 others
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.700]   that haven't gotten into the membership yet
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.140]   are all about this Peloton challenge
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.780]   and like something we're thinking about.
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.220]   - Yeah, I like it.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.740]   Okay, so first book, focus on Crush It.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.620]   Most recent book, much more on the softer skills.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.940]   - Yeah.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.620]   - You said you'd rather, or my takeaway was that
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.460]   you'd rather be known for kindness than hustle
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.540]   in the long term.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.700]   That's a focus.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.220]   Why is kindness so important to you?
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.140]   - Well, because at 47, it's clear to me
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.340]   that that's an equal variable to work ethic
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.180]   that's brought me to the place that I'm at.
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.420]   And the thing that I watch and admire in others
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.340]   who are in similar places.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.700]   I think there's an incredibly disgusting concept
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.380]   in society that says nice guys finish last.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.260]   I think it's an awful thing.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.460]   As a matter of fact, I really need to make a hoodie
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.620]   and start rocking it that says nice guys finish first
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.220]   'cause I really believe that.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.100]   Because I think it's what are you judging?
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.060]   Like cool, you made $83 million in the bank and you die
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.420]   and nine people show up to your funeral was like that good?
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.060]   I would argue it's not.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.740]   And so, you know, when I wrote Crush It,
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.660]   what was obvious to me at that point was
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.500]   the internet had a huge opportunity.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.940]   Influencers were gonna be big.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.620]   People laughed at that concept.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.860]   That work ethic was a requirement.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.500]   You know, I was 34.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.500]   All I knew was my dad and myself worked our faces off
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.140]   to like build the American dream.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.380]   And that finding something you liked
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.620]   would make it not feel like work,
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.420]   which would eliminate the anxiety of the work.
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.780]   At 47, when I write 12 1/2,
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.940]   I've now built a 2,000 person global company.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.260]   I know why it's working.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.980]   I know why it's indisputably gonna disrupt
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.180]   the marketing industry.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.580]   It's because people wanna be here forever.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.460]   I looked back at Wine Library and be like,
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.300]   wait a minute, that's the same thing
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.740]   that happened there actually.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.020]   And then I just think about like my life.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.500]   And then also I think about the hundreds of companies
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.420]   I've invested in, the ones that have worked,
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.500]   the ones that haven't.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.980]   The thousands of companies I've consultant,
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.780]   the ones that work, the ones that I don't.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.860]   And you know, I think again,
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.460]   back to the way this podcast started,
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.540]   if you started it with like,
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.140]   Gary, nice guys finish first.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.660]   Like what are people missing?
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.860]   Or if you went the other way and said,
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.820]   hey, Gary, you really hate the nice guys finish last.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.220]   What are people missing?
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.900]   It's similar to the hustle conversation,
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.500]   the work ethic conversation.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.980]   There's multiple ingredients.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.180]   It's why the book is subtitled Ingredients.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.220]   There are multiple ingredients that I think stand out
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.300]   as a consistent North Star blueprint
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.780]   that have sustainable, enjoyable success attached to them.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.060]   And I think work ethic, and I think kindness,
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.420]   and I think curiosity.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.780]   And several others are pretty standard.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.980]   Now, some people are stronger than others.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.940]   And that's why there's so many variable differences
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.300]   of so many different things out there.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.540]   But it works for me.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.900]   And like, I really enjoy being nice.
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.580]   Like I like the way that, you know,
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.420]   you know this as well 'cause you've watched this journey
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.980]   from me being like someone,
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.820]   a couple people knew to a lot more people know.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.180]   You know, I've always enjoyed the fact that even today,
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.380]   like the people that know me best
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.460]   have the best feelings towards me.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.660]   That's a nice feeling,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.020]   especially when you've become a public figure.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.940]   And a lot of people have a lot of different takes.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.540]   There's a sense of like calmness that comes along with,
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.940]   well, like as people get closer to me,
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.380]   they have a better taste of me.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.700]   I'd be much happier with that than the reverse,
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.740]   which I think a lot of people in the world have,
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.940]   which is they may be liked optically on the outside,
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.860]   but as you get closer to their inner circle,
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.380]   it gets more rotten quickly.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.220]   - Yeah.
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.820]   The interesting thing about kindness is
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.620]   it feels like the thing that most people
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.660]   probably think they have.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.780]   And when you double click,
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.700]   there's aspects of their personality.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.100]   And I'll even like open up,
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.140]   like there are times where I find myself saying things like,
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.860]   "Ah, this person's annoying."
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.820]   Like, you know, we're not...
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.820]   Is cutting all negativity?
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.780]   Does that like level it up?
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.620]   Or how do you really own kindness?
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.420]   - I think it's understanding negativity
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.020]   versus cutting it out.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:53.860]   We're all humans.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.620]   I mean, I'm gonna go to the garden tonight
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.260]   and the things I'm gonna say to Jimmy Butler
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.020]   are gonna be completely inappropriate.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.860]   Though I love Jimmy Butler,
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.700]   represents so much of what I believe in.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.460]   But for those three hours, I will not be kind.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.580]   It's the context.
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.420]   And like, you know,
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.020]   like every human's gonna gossip a little bit
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.700]   or like talk to their best friend in the office
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.220]   about somebody else in the office.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.660]   I think the question becomes, why?
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.860]   You know, I ask myself,
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:21.140]   why do I not spend a lot of time tearing down other people?
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.020]   It starts with because I'm not tearing down myself.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.620]   I don't really have a whole lot of envy.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.300]   You know, I don't deploy a lot of jealousy.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.980]   I don't hold resentment towards my parents
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.860]   or other important figures in my life
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:38.580]   for anything that I deem that they did that wasn't good.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.420]   Right?
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.780]   And I think that's a very common trait for the masses.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.940]   I think, I mean, I know people who just can't let go.
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.020]   Just spend all their time on jealousy, envy, and resentment.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.140]   And then it manifests.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.740]   It's in their subconscious.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.140]   And then like every day to day,
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.740]   if they see someone who's happy,
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.500]   they get triggered to make,
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.540]   to kind of point out what they're not good at
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.380]   or what they're unhappy.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.060]   So I think we're all human and we, everyone has it.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.980]   But I think getting to a place
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.660]   where you figure out your relationship with yourself,
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.460]   I think can be quite powerful.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.980]   And I think always has a direct indication
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.380]   of how people feel about others.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.020]   I always believe that the bullies in the world,
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.620]   the nasties of the world,
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.660]   the not able to be civil with others of the world
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.420]   are always in a really tough spot with themselves.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.580]   - So kindness, it's funny.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.140]   We always think about kindness as like,
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.340]   I'm kind to people.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.100]   But it sounds like the like unlock
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.860]   is realizing you need to be kind to yourself
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.380]   and you need to understand yourself.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.220]   You've said,
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.340]   I think self-awareness is like a superpower
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.140]   most people don't realize.
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.180]   - In a way that really matters, brother.
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.900]   Like in a way that's like,
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.620]   man, if I could wish anything for people on earth,
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.860]   besides good health,
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.660]   for everyone who's listening in this great community,
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.540]   'cause I know the kind that you would cultivate.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.860]   I just think to myself,
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.500]   like who's a listener of this
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.140]   based on I know good amount about you.
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.620]   And like, I've been watching you for a long time.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.340]   Like, you know,
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.540]   there's like a really high standard of human on here.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.420]   But I think a lot of them are blind to certain aspects.
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.060]   And I think the biggest one is like,
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.580]   just be like easier on yourself.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.700]   Like the extreme level of judgment
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.220]   people put on themselves
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.740]   because they play the game of comparison.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.740]   Like, the enjoyment I get to see Kev or Tim Ferriss
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.740]   or I mean, anybody like Sarah Blakely in spec.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.380]   Like, I don't know, like you, like anybody.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.700]   Like I get thrilled when I see people are winning
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.180]   as if that's coming out of mine.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.160]   I've always been baffled by people's inability
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.540]   to understand that the world is abundant
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.460]   and nobody, nobody is taking out of yours.
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.140]   If 50 people showed up tomorrow
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.940]   that are incredible public speakers,
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.580]   not a dollar is taken out of my pocket.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.260]   There's plenty of speaking gigs I could do.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.340]   You know, and so I think I really,
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.960]   I really wish people understood that.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.100]   And I think understanding who
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.660]   you're trying to accomplish for is also very important.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.700]   There's a lot of people listening here
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.060]   who are still trying to make their parents proud,
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.500]   even though their parents are not capable
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.620]   of ever giving that, you know, co-sign to their child
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.100]   because they themselves never got it from their parents.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.280]   So a lot of people blame their parents
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.380]   and haven't done the work of figuring out
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.480]   that they should actually be blaming their grandparents,
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.060]   which then leads them to actually realize
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.340]   they should be blaming their great-grandparents.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.900]   And it becomes this game where you can give your parents
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.020]   a lot more leeway, which actually a lot of times
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.580]   for people is an unlock.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.060]   And it's kind of like, you know,
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.260]   you can get it off your chest.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.780]   And, you know, I think, yeah,
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.020]   I'm very passionate about this subject matter.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.340]   - Are there things people can,
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.780]   that are listening can do to start
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.380]   to build better self-awareness?
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.740]   Is there like a training regimen
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.300]   or some activity that you've seen be helpful?
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.820]   - I think one is to really start
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.360]   to make the people closer to them,
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.500]   feel comfortable with giving them truth and candor.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.180]   So like finding that best friend where like,
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.380]   if you can go to that one place where you think you,
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.340]   whether it's your mom or dad or best friend or spouse,
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.380]   where you're like, hey,
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.660]   I'm actually starting a journey of self-awareness.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.260]   And I know that I've always been the kind of person
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.100]   that can get very defensive or it can lead to a fight.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.380]   Or you just love me so much,
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.940]   you don't wanna hurt my feelings, but no bullshit.
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.260]   Can you just, you know, like answer a couple questions
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.700]   for me, like, you know how everybody says,
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.420]   like, I have all this talent.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.940]   Like, am I lazy?
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.660]   Like, if you can get a person that loves you
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.940]   to a place where they'll tell you the truth,
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.500]   you can really start to unlock some conversations
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.740]   that can give you some affirmation
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.780]   on something you've been fighting off.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.420]   - It's funny you say this.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.100]   I remember, I hope he's okay with me talking about this.
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.480]   Kevin had this, went through this process
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.140]   and actually hired someone to call a bunch of his friends
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.700]   and have that kind of like performance review conversation
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.880]   and be like, you know, I'm gonna keep this anonymous.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.580]   I'm not gonna sign it to you, but like,
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.360]   Kevin wants to know like, what can he improve in?
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.500]   Like, where is he letting his friends down?
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.940]   What would you tell him if, you know,
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.860]   you knew he wouldn't be able to know it was you?
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.460]   And it sounds like, you know,
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.980]   not everyone needs to hire someone to do that.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.220]   You could, you know, it's hard.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.580]   Sometimes your friends don't wanna be honest.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.820]   - No, I think what you just said is a viable
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.700]   and maybe even a cleaner data set than what I'm referring to.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.900]   And, you know, I'm just very aware
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.820]   that most people can't afford to hire someone to do that,
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.660]   right, or even think of it, but like, look at-
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.820]   - But even a friend, like, ask a friend,
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.500]   can you just call these five people and ask, you know?
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.660]   - I like it, I like it.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.040]   To your point, in my version,
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.440]   I'm not asking that most inner person to give it to you.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.040]   To your point, maybe that inner person
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.320]   is the one that cultivates the data.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.640]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.960]   - Or an anonymous Google form.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.240]   - I think, I like that too, I like that too.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   I think people have to be ready, right?
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.120]   I had to be ready at 30.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.160]   For eight years, I knew health and fitness
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.300]   was something I wanted to be,
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.160]   but it was finally on a flight from Houston to New York
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.000]   with my head against a window where I was like, it's time.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.400]   You know, like, for a lot of people right now,
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.780]   they're hearing this and they're pushing against it,
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.180]   like, nah, because they're not ready.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.420]   For another listener today, this was the moment.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.620]   Like, in the last week or two,
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.180]   they just got ready of like, you know what?
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.860]   I just want my life to be happier,
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.100]   and this is part of the equation.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.900]   Like, look, out of all the things,
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.060]   work ethic, passion, kindness,
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.700]   I will say that accountability, I would argue,
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.740]   is probably the quickest indicator to how happy you are.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.400]   If you are truly interested in being accountable.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.420]   - To yourself?
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.060]   - Yeah, to the whole thing, to yourself,
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.660]   to everyone around you, to every situation,
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.820]   to every relationship, to the truth.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.220]   Like, when, you know, I'll give you a good example.
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.080]   In my 20s and 30s, I would struggle so much
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.280]   with firing people and giving them candorous feedback
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.460]   that almost every exit at Wine Library
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.380]   and early VaynerMedia was sloppy.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.020]   They stayed a year longer 'cause I wrestled with it.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.220]   And then when I would do it, it would just be a shit show.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.400]   Like, it would be, I'd ask my cousin Bobby to do it,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.660]   even though I was the one who interacted
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.620]   with the person every day, 500 days a year.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.060]   I would flub it.
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.860]   I would go in quick and get out with any,
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.860]   you know, I would over, I would talk for three minutes
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.380]   about how they're the greatest and be like,
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.340]   but that being said, we're gonna have to let you go,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.260]   and they'd be confused.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.240]   And so, there was two, 300 people over a 20-year period,
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.060]   back to what I said earlier, that were close to me
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.980]   and did actually know me,
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.200]   who did not have a good taste towards me.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.100]   What did I do in my 20s and early 30s?
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.220]   I would blame them.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.120]   I'd be like, how could that person be mad at me?
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.980]   They were so, like, they were the worst.
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.500]   They were so incapable at their job.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.820]   I was such a good guy for letting them
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.960]   even be in the company for another year or two.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.800]   Look what's happened.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.300]   They've not been successful in their last two places.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.540]   And it took me getting into my late 30s
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.160]   and really actually into my mid 40s.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.900]   Fuck my late 30s, not my late 30s.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.540]   It got into the last three or four or five years
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.260]   where I was like, you know what?
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:05.780]   My lack of candor is the kryptonite
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.420]   to the thing I said 15 minutes earlier,
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.980]   which is I love that people that know me like me a lot.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.040]   Asterisk, people that have worked for me
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.060]   that were not good at their job in my subjective opinion,
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.220]   that I let sit around 'cause I was too scared
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.340]   or was not interested in conflict.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.800]   And I created so much resentment and passive aggressiveness
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.100]   that eventually it boiled over and then they were fired.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.820]   That group of 100 to 200 people on earth
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.040]   don't have the same good taste towards me
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.480]   than the 10,000 that have been close to me in my life.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.400]   That took me being accountable to like,
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.000]   that's on me 'cause I struggled with candor,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.460]   which is why in the book,
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.040]   the last book that you're referencing,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.080]   the reason I wrote "12 1/2" was strictly
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.160]   at the end of the day to talk about kind candor.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.560]   This concept that I rebranded it to myself
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.700]   and now I'm better at candor,
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.920]   but it took a lot of professional and personal losing
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.360]   for me to get to that point where I could be accountable
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.240]   and be like, hey, okay, tough guy,
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.920]   you're good at a lot of shit, that's nice,
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.640]   or a lot of people, this is something you stink at
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.920]   and will continue to be a problem in your life
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.840]   unless you're able to build.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.480]   And I'm proud of where I'm at with candor now.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.720]   I'm a five, I'm a 4.7, I'm a 5.2.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.040]   That's a lot better than a one.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.600]   And I gotta tell you, in the last two, three years
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.120]   at Boehner X, the holding company,
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.840]   Boehner Media, the agency,
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.760]   the company's much stronger 'cause of it.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.160]   My greatest pride as a leader was eliminating fear.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.800]   I got this, I got this, I got this.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.580]   I got you, we got this.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.380]   And I delivered for years,
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.760]   but what really was rock bottom for me
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.720]   was when I realized, wait a minute,
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.560]   there's a lot of people walking around scared
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.320]   'cause they don't know if out of nowhere
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.520]   they're just gonna get fired
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.600]   because I'm like, everything's great until it's not.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.080]   And then I have to start giving more candor along the way
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.960]   and my organization does it better
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.320]   because I do it better and it's been a big growth for me.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.160]   - Have you, you mentioned earlier that you liked
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.400]   that that reporter reached out to you three years later.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.480]   Have you reached out to those 100 to 200 people?
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.760]   - I've reached out to many people.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.160]   I have, I like making amends.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.640]   Luckily for me, and this is just like,
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.900]   so the answer is several.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:21.600]   Luckily for me, there was a lot of good
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.360]   in what happened until the end.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.840]   And so for a lot of people,
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.680]   when they've gone on to have
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.600]   two or three other work experiences,
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.560]   they were able to contextualize what I was doing well.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.040]   And so to the credit to a lot of those people,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.800]   a lot of those 100 to 200 people,
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.920]   two, four, five years later have reached out to me.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.160]   And then, because I was still on my journey,
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.320]   I wasn't there yet.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.680]   And then to me, when they did that,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.280]   I would come so hard and say,
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.600]   hey, Jimmy, Sally, thank you,
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.560]   but hey, I need to own a piece of this as well.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.840]   Over the last two, three, four years,
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.760]   I've been better at starting that conversation
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.840]   versus being the follow-up to that.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.920]   - Yeah, I mean, I appreciate you being vulnerable,
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.320]   saying, I'm not good at this thing.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.360]   'Cause I think from the outside, everyone's like,
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.080]   Gary must be great at everything.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.520]   - Yeah, and honestly, from the outside,
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.360]   I think a lot of people,
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.840]   back to the way we started this podcast,
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.080]   assume I'm not good at a lot of things.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.460]   For example, people are blown away
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.340]   when they hear that I don't like conflict,
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.920]   because on public stages and in podcasts,
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.760]   especially 'cause I always talk about innovation
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   and breaking things, seemingly, I like it.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.120]   So, there's different versions.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.040]   I think the other thing for everybody who's listening
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.160]   is like, look, a very important thing,
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.580]   back to judgment, is I don't make assumptions about anybody.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.000]   Like every person I know that I don't know,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.280]   I make almost no assumptions.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.320]   You don't know if they're aunt.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.280]   I'll give you an example of shit I think about
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.720]   when somebody's judging someone.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.400]   Like, oh, someone famous like Ryan Reynolds
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.420]   has the best life ever.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.800]   You don't know if the most important person
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.620]   in that person's life was his aunt who was a mother figure
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.280]   and she's been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.600]   How do you think that person's walking around right now?
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.640]   You know, or in your office,
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.320]   like that person got the promotion.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.220]   They're so lucky.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.060]   Are they?
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.460]   You don't know that their spouse might be dealing
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.360]   with alcoholism currently right now.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.680]   You know, so, you know, I think it's,
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.920]   I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.840]   I think another thing that really works for my temperament,
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.160]   for my peace of mind, for my joy,
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.080]   is my lack of capacity to make assumptions
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.560]   about other people's lives.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.280]   Like I just, there's nobody I think has a great.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.120]   It's inconceivable.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.420]   Everyone's a human.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.260]   It's inevitable.
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.800]   And by the way, even when someone does have a great,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.920]   and people have had, I've had 'em,
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.600]   people have had 'em, eight year, nine year,
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.320]   six year, 12 year, 20 year runs.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.940]   Life is too challenging.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.600]   I know friends who I know intimately
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.920]   and know well enough to say the following,
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.160]   great 10, seven, 12 years, and then boom, child sick.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.880]   Great 10, 12 years, and boom,
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.840]   father was the rock of the family, gone, heart attack.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:03.520]   So, you know, this concept that somebody's got a great life
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.400]   is like just incredibly judgmental
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.800]   and lacks like the nuances I think are required.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.680]   And I think we are at a hyperbole
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.920]   of this judgment world now.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.480]   We are full headline reading.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.080]   We are full cancel culture.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.700]   We are full assumptions.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.120]   We are full envy.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.840]   And I don't think this is a social media thing.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.000]   This is what's always happened.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.040]   We're just hearing us talk it out.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.380]   You know, people in well-to-do neighborhoods for years
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.800]   have envied the person that's the richest
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.640]   or the handsomest husband or the,
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.240]   like people just, you know,
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.600]   really need to get back to like being insular,
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.400]   loving themselves, thus allowing them
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.080]   to start to love others.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.920]   - I mean, you said earlier people would be happier
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.320]   if they weren't chasing money.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.240]   They weren't chasing dreams.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.000]   They weren't chasing status.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.880]   - Dreams you should chase.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.720]   - Okay, fair.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.640]   - Right, like I want to be the best surfer.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.480]   That's fun.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.680]   Like dreams are fun when you don't beat yourself up
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.600]   on accomplishing it.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.840]   When you champion yourself on trying to accomplish it.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.560]   And then you being realistic about it.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.040]   But go ahead, what was your thought?
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.760]   - No, part of that was you said
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.440]   people were doing what they love
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.720]   and weren't as focused on money.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.640]   They'd probably be a lot happier.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.680]   I want to spend a couple minutes on something
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.940]   that you've talked about before,
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.560]   but to someone listening who's like, okay, I want that.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.260]   I can learn to detach from the need to be as good
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.800]   as I might perceive someone to be,
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.600]   which might actually, you might be completely wrong.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.580]   On the figuring out what you should be doing front,
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.000]   have you seen people make that discovery
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.480]   of like that's the thing that I should be doing?
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.640]   And are there things they did to get there?
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.960]   - Yes, I've seen it a lot
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.040]   because of what I talk about
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.400]   and how many DMs and emails I read for the last 15 years.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.080]   So far, it all happens from extremes.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.540]   Horrible divorce.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.720]   Now, whomever the wife or the husband
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.680]   is in like a financially challenged situation,
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.160]   like life's different.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.560]   And they're forced into doing something.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.640]   And they just happen to be consuming mind
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.960]   and other positioning of like,
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.600]   if you're gonna do this, do something you like.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.040]   And all of a sudden, they have a business making kites.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.140]   This is a real one.
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.920]   And it was just really therapy
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.320]   'cause there was so much pain.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.000]   And kites, I mean, I remember this email vividly.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.420]   Kites were a big part of their childhood and they enjoyed.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.600]   And it was really nasty.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.920]   Like not, it was very challenging.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.320]   The father that flew kites with this person
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.560]   passed and then six months later, divorce.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.940]   And then like really in a challenging spot.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.880]   And this person decided to follow the passion route
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.000]   versus getting a job like everyone told them.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.680]   And she sold kites on Etsy.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.760]   And like four years later,
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.280]   was selling like $400,000 a year in kites.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.300]   And so like that or the complete other side,
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.640]   someone just hearing the message in the right way
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.600]   and realizing in their early 20s,
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.320]   you have nothing but capacity for risk
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.440]   and decided to like run into it,
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.520]   which is like, and I've seen a lot of versions,
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.300]   just being very humble and aware
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.820]   that they are in a financial family
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.480]   that allows them to go full risk for passion.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.840]   Just having a parachute and a landing route.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.760]   The reverse, so pissed at their often Asian or immigrant
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.040]   or Indian parents of like,
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.520]   I'm not gonna be a doctor or engineer you fucking assholes.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.760]   Like I'm going for it.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.040]   So like in extremes, I've seen it in extremes.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.560]   I'm hoping to get those edges
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.040]   into the middle a little more.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.000]   I'm hoping someone right now who's just like,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.080]   to me the dream state is the person who's listening now
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.580]   that's making 210 and living a 250 lifestyle.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.380]   They make $210,000 a year.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.660]   They live a $250,000 lifestyle.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.680]   And they realize that if they lived $100,000 lifestyle,
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.080]   it would take the golden handcuffs off of them
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.260]   to maybe take the leap and go for it.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.300]   So they're obsessed with cooking
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.500]   and they want their own little like bakery,
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.100]   but they don't have any savings.
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.180]   'Cause again, their apartment's too expensive.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.300]   Their car's too expensive.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.660]   Their vacations are too expensive.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.540]   Their nights out are too expensive.
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.420]   They order bagels on Seamless and Postmates.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.300]   Like do you know how many people buy $30 bagels currently?
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.740]   Chris, like a lot. - I don't, I want to not.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.420]   - Well, but we know this like,
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.740]   and this is more like the Uber thing
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:15.660]   that we learned years ago.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.580]   Like people will pay for convenience at scale.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.580]   There are people right now who are buying $30 bagels
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.620]   and don't even realize it, right?
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.260]   They're buying an $8 bagel on Postmates or Seamless
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.340]   or Uber Eats, but then there's the surcharge,
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.020]   the charge, the delivery fee.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.420]   They kind of are blindly on the tip
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.480]   'cause they want to be a good person.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.620]   Like you kind of wake up and it's a $28 bagel.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.220]   Like, and that person is,
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.100]   that same person is buying a $28 bagel
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.140]   'cause they make $210,000 a year.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.460]   But deep down, they're like,
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.980]   they hate being in this law firm more than life.
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.020]   Like literally can't wait to five or six o'clock every day.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.380]   Truly can't.
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.540]   Yet want to own a bakery.
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.900]   Yet like want to start a podcast on Star Trek.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.940]   Yet like, and I believe they can,
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.620]   but do they have the humility to move back in
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.820]   with their 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 year old parents?
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.800]   Probably not.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.740]   Do they have the humility to like get a roommate?
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.580]   Probably not.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.060]   Like do they have the awareness to say,
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.260]   I should move out of New York
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.860]   and maybe move to a suburb of Wisconsin
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.620]   because I actually like the outdoors
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.940]   and my lifestyle there can afford it?
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.900]   Like, especially right now, I got one,
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.220]   I haven't thought about this until this exact microsecond.
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.220]   We are living right now in a world
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.260]   where a lot of companies will let you work remote.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.300]   I've been talking about this whole quit your job,
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.680]   start your life by going humble.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.040]   How about don't quit your job, ask for a move.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.220]   And so you literally go from New York, LA,
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.700]   San Francisco, Dallas to literally lower cost,
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.500]   deep suburbs of those places.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.740]   You know, my parents live an hour and a half
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.140]   from this office.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.520]   Living in Hunterdon County, New Jersey,
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.820]   you can live for a lot less than living in Manhattan.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.500]   Could you do that?
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.820]   And could you take those savings,
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.780]   could you cut out the $30 bagel?
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.280]   Can you take one less vacation?
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.100]   Could you trade in the car you have now for a downgrade?
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.660]   And can you take all those savings on that 210,
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.020]   now you're living a 130 lifestyle, right?
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.660]   And can you stack 30,000 savings three years in a row
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.480]   to give you that $100,000 nest egg to go?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.660]   That's a level of practicality around passion
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.560]   that I hope becomes a bigger norm.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.360]   - Totally agree.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.840]   I actually have been thinking about this
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.260]   as you're talking that my new hypothesis
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.640]   is that once you start doing the thing that you really like,
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.800]   you actually probably will care less
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.500]   about all these other things going on, right?
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.220]   If you hate your job, like of course you're like,
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.100]   oh, I need these other things to make me happy,
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.340]   my friends have these things.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.700]   - It's all in, all out.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.540]   - Yeah.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.760]   - Like when I work out, I eat better.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.260]   If I don't work out in the morning, I eat worse.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.960]   So it's an all in or all out.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.580]   When you like what you do,
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.860]   the majority of your life, aka your job,
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.900]   well then all of a sudden you aren't spending $50
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:59.100]   on cocktails after work to deal with what's going on.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.540]   You don't have seven streaming services
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.180]   to escape what's going on.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.600]   You like don't find band-aids.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.160]   You get, you know, like you don't find band-aids
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.060]   for the issue and the issue is your relationship
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.340]   and your job.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:16.280]   And like figuring that out is massive.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.340]   - I got two final things.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.980]   One, so you're all in on the,
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.900]   let's say you're all in on something,
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.540]   which I kind of am on this podcast.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.760]   It's like I found the thing that's me.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.600]   It's my calling.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.020]   Once you love it so much, you know,
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:26.860]   I know you have kids.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.540]   How do you find this balance of I love what I'm doing?
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.780]   A part of me is like I could spend every waking hour
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.740]   thinking about it, but I also love this other thing.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.900]   I have these two big ambitions.
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.060]   - You wanna mitigate regret.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.980]   And like anybody who has kids realizes
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.020]   like you don't wanna wake up when they're 20
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.900]   and realize your relationship isn't strong
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.180]   and they don't wanna see you anymore.
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.300]   And like they were accustomed to living
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.620]   without you being in their lives
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.900]   and like it's devastating.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.620]   And so I just think you're thoughtful.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.260]   I think, look, there's no such thing as balance.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.500]   There's your subjective opinion of balance, right?
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.300]   I love when people like judge
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.740]   other people's work-life balance.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.620]   You don't know their family.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.380]   This goes back to a lot of things we talked about.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.540]   So I think for every person here, be willing to adapt.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.620]   I've changed and ebbed and flow multiple times
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.220]   over the last 15 years on it.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.820]   All here, this, more there, less, weekend.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.100]   Like, you know, I think everyone's got their own thing.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.740]   Like, you know, I work very hard Monday through Friday,
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.860]   and I'm pretty checked out on weekends and holidays.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.980]   And when I say pretty checked out, I'm checked out.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.380]   Like, unless there's a super fire, right?
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.220]   And so other people may work nine to six
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.420]   or nine to five during the week,
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.300]   but they're also working on the weekend
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.380]   on their phone the whole time.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.980]   Like, everyone plays it different.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.740]   And by the way, you may go all in
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.180]   for three years on this podcast
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.100]   'cause there's a moment right now, right?
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.460]   And, but then in three years, you may be like,
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.860]   wait a minute, I've done that.
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.260]   So like, look over here, these little ones are getting big.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.940]   And like, wait a minute, I'm worried.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.020]   And so you can go all in there.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:58.140]   Like, people can find balance in extremes.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.780]   You can't judge yourself on a day-to-day basis
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.700]   on these big issues.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.580]   It's a bigger thing than that.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.060]   You know, look at all the people that reconcile
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:11.140]   with their relationships years later and have great,
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.060]   I mean, I have a friend who didn't speak
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.700]   to their father for 40 years,
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.260]   and now has had an incredible five years.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.180]   And that's because they've leaned into forgiveness.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.900]   You know, like, I think you gotta,
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.060]   I think it starts with forgiving yourself.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.220]   You know, back to your question.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.460]   Like, there's a lot of parents right now
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.700]   who have 17-year-olds who are like, oh, too late.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.140]   No, not too late.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.660]   Like, there's never a bad day
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.900]   to start doing the right thing.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.740]   - Yeah.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.500]   - Like, if you're 62 and you've never been good
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.260]   at health and wellness, good news.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.780]   Tomorrow is a good idea to do it.
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.020]   If you have 18-year-old twins and you've worked
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.460]   on just your career for the last 18 years,
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.180]   and you can sense they're about to go to college
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.940]   and they don't give a shit about you.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.220]   They love you, but they're accustomed
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.660]   to not having you be a big part of their lives, good news.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.540]   You could visit them every weekend at college.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.620]   Probably a bad idea.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:04.740]   They might not like that.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.180]   But, like, you could start today to put it in.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.340]   If you are angry at your mother
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.940]   and you've got 20 years of resentment built up,
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.100]   like, good news.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.780]   Today is the day you can start therapy.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.860]   Today is the day you can go have a canterous conversation
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.140]   that is built on compassion for your mom,
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.740]   that gets some of the poison out.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.580]   Like, there is never a bad day
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:29.980]   to start doing the right things that are most upsetting you.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.780]   - I love it.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:36.060]   The last thing, kids, you know, everyone listening
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.140]   could share this with their parents.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.260]   They could share it with their spouse.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.380]   They could start to think about these lessons.
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.460]   I can't go share this with a one, a three-year-old,
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.820]   probably not a five, six, seven-year-old.
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.140]   Are there things you're doing to try to instill,
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.580]   let's take your kind of 12 and a half lessons.
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.500]   - Self-esteem.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.260]   - That's the thing.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.100]   - That's the thing.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.260]   And not delusional self-esteem.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.140]   - Okay.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.820]   - If your seven-year-old loves Beyonce,
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.180]   but when she's running around the house singing,
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.620]   like, literally, you have to put earplugs in
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.140]   'cause it's the worst sound you've ever heard,
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.180]   it's probably a bad idea to tell her
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.740]   she can be Beyonce one day too.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.860]   It's not a bad idea to say, if she puts in a lot of work,
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.360]   she could be better at singing than she is today.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.500]   These sort of, so to me, it's self-esteem.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.540]   Also, what do you compliment your kids on?
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.500]   If you're complimenting your kids constantly
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.700]   on how attractive they are, you're so beautiful,
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.820]   you're so cute, you're so handsome,
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.940]   you're instilling affirmation on that,
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.900]   which is gonna affect them when they're in their 30s,
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.100]   40s, 50s, and 60s 'cause that's gonna be their self-worth.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.140]   If you're telling them that they're remarkable
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.120]   because they're getting A's in school,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.140]   you're teaching them to conform to systems
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.060]   that aren't real once they become 22.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.140]   Might not be the best idea.
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.340]   You know, eighth place trophies bother me,
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.900]   not because I'm so competitive,
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.180]   but because you're telling your kids that losing is bad.
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.760]   Like, kids are smart.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.860]   Kids are smart.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.100]   So they realize the reason they're getting
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.060]   an eighth place trophy is like you, as the parent,
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.020]   don't want them to feel losing.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.480]   Losing is bad.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.580]   The problem is losing is such a fundamental part of life
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.040]   that you're teaching kids to be scared of it
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.220]   instead of leaning into it.
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:19.220]   So I think, for me, it's practical self-esteem, truth.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.160]   - What do you compliment your kids on?
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.180]   - Their humanity.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:27.720]   Whenever I see them interact with humans
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.600]   and are kind, compassionate, empathetic,
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.300]   when my son will go over to somebody who gets hurt,
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.800]   I mean, he drilled a line drive off of when coaches
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.760]   were pitching two years ago when he was eight.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.940]   He drilled.
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.440]   He was very good at baseball between like six and 10.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.920]   Drilled a line drive that drilled the head coach.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.140]   He ran, you know, he hit it,
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.920]   so he started running towards first base and he stopped
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.000]   and like in the middle of the base path
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.260]   and asked the head coach if he was okay.
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.720]   You know, after the game, the coach came up to him,
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.480]   he's like, "Look, I've been hit a lot of times
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.400]   "in the history, I've been doing it for 30 years."
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.200]   He's like, "I've never had a kid just stop and do that."
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.000]   And I bring that up to my son every day.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Like, do you know how good of a person you are?
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.080]   Even though you're so competitive
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.440]   in baseball as your passion, like you did that.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.300]   The humanity of it versus the thing.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.660]   So I try to focus on those things.
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:21.700]   - I love it.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.140]   I feel like this is not the conversation
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.840]   I think a lot of people thought we were gonna have
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.040]   and I like that.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:30.220]   Any final words or where people should go to see more Gary?
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.300]   - You know, I think building off of what you just said,
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.200]   I think it was a theme of everything.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.080]   Like, books by covers is a real issue
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.680]   in our society right now.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.400]   I think, you know, for me, I think to your point,
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.280]   I think 90% of your audience will be like,
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.120]   "Oh, that was interesting.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.460]   "Didn't see that going that way."
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.040]   I think for 10% of your audience,
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:49.940]   when you just said that, they're like,
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:50.780]   "What are you talking about, Chris?
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.800]   "That is Gary."
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.640]   Why?
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.040]   Because they've allocated the time to go deeper.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.760]   I think, you know, we are really in it
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.620]   in our society right now, politically, socially,
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.580]   nationalism, geopolitically.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.940]   There's a lot going on.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.820]   And we're also affected by the last 30 years of parenting
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.340]   where I do think we over swung too far in certain areas
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.820]   like eighth place trophies,
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.900]   which has made a lot of people anxious.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:21.500]   You know, so what I would say as a final thought is,
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.640]   if you find yourself thinking that in this interview
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.980]   or any other of Chris's interviews,
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.160]   it's definitely what made me think about the world.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.640]   Like when I started going through my 20s and 30s
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.520]   and meeting people that I had different thoughts of.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.720]   And then when I got to double click in,
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.780]   either in person or through content consumption,
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.380]   I'm like, "Ah, right."
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.960]   And so I think, you know,
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.380]   that will lead to a much happier life.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.160]   But like the theme of this whole podcast,
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.200]   it starts with yourself.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.040]   Finding how to not judge yourself for your shortcomings
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.160]   and accept yourself for your shortcomings.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.980]   And champion and be proud of your strengths
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.220]   is a really nice framework to be able to do it for others,
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.860]   especially your children, your spouse, your parents,
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.660]   and then going to your friends and acquaintances.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.380]   And then just the world.
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.240]   I think this world desperately needs more civility
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.260]   and warmth.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.700]   And I think people are looking for others to provide it.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.420]   And I think back to accountability,
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.260]   it starts with yourself.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.460]   And so I think you're capable of it.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.260]   I really do, whether that's therapy
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.420]   or listening to different things
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.880]   or starting a regimen of health or wellness
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.820]   or mindset that gets you to that place.
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.600]   And I think you should do that
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.760]   'cause it's a lot more fun to live life happy
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.860]   because final thought,
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.800]   you were dead for a long time, aka not born,
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.580]   and you will be dead forever.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.120]   And so I think it's a good idea
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.320]   to maximize your hundred years, God willing.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.560]   And so consider that.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.400]   - I love it.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.680]   Reach out if this was helpful.

[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.040]   Gary's easy to find on the internet.
