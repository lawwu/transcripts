[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.600]   - Lindsay writes in to ask, "Pastor John,
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.680]   "you've spoken before about how you've walked through
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.560]   "some challenging seasons in marriage over the years.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.380]   "If you can go back in time to give yourself
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.280]   "some of the most important wisdom about marriage
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.120]   "that you've learned in the trenches,
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.940]   "what would you say to a younger John Piper?
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.200]   "What expectations would you tell him to relinquish
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.760]   "and what would you tell him to practice?"
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.580]   - I would say to him, "John,
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.160]   "behold the mystery of this union.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.020]   "Behold the mystery of this amazing, God-wrought union.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.380]   "For all the millions of marriages on the earth,
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.700]   "none of them is merely human, including yours.
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.100]   "None of them, yours included, is merely natural.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.500]   "They're all more, they're all amazing.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.560]   "So lift up your eyes, John Piper,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.740]   "young, newly married John Piper.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.220]   "Lift up your eyes to see
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.540]   "what you've gotten yourself into here,
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.540]   "an amazing, God-wrought mystery."
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.900]   Mark 10, nine, "What God has joined together,
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.480]   "let not man separate."
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.660]   So this is a God-made mystery.
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.900]   The pastor, when he said,
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.780]   "I now pronounce you man and wife," didn't do it.
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.180]   He didn't do it.
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.540]   God did it.
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.700]   What God has joined together.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.820]   So marriage is not man-made.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.300]   Not even for unbelievers is it man-made.
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.300]   God joins people through promise and covenant
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.140]   and union into one flesh.
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.820]   Something new has come into existence.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.980]   So John Piper, lift up your eyes
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.060]   onto this reality and realize
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.060]   the unending implications of this for your life.
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.300]   And one of them is, it's unbreakable.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.820]   Only death.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.260]   There's no backdoor to this.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.260]   So Noel and I said, and I would say to myself again,
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.220]   "Divorce is not a solution
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.300]   "to any of our miseries if we have them."
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.940]   And we have had them.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.000]   So don't even look at it.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.280]   Don't even contemplate it.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.280]   Death ends this union that God has created, nothing else.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.900]   And I would say to myself,
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.040]   look at the mystery of marriage,
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.500]   that it was conceived by God in history
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.000]   as a pattern for the church and Christ.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.740]   Sometimes we think the other way around.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.740]   We think, well, look, there's the church.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.120]   How are you gonna describe marriage?
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.820]   Well, let's describe marriage
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.760]   the way Christ relates to the church.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.600]   No, no, no.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.620]   Marriage came first.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.080]   Marriage came into history first,
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.580]   and it came into history in the form that it came
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.620]   so that the church could be seen this way
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.740]   and so that marriage could relate to the church
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.660]   and Christ this way.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.520]   So what I would say to my younger self
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.300]   from Ephesians 5, 31 and 32,
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.100]   "A man shall leave his father and mother
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.300]   "and hold fast to his wife.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.680]   "The two shall become one flesh."
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.100]   This mystery is profound,
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.740]   and I am saying it refers to Christ in the church.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.180]   I would say, "John, look at the mystery
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.240]   "of what this means for your love of this woman.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.140]   "This is a bottomless ocean of wisdom for you.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.340]   "Love her like Christ loves the church."
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.820]   I just sang this morning.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.880]   This is really amazing.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.880]   I just sang, I sang this morning Samuel Crossman's hymn,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.040]   "My Song is Love Unknown," which has these two lines.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.340]   "My song is love unknown, my savior's love to me.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.340]   "Love to the loveless shown that they might lovely be."
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.360]   And even before you asked me this question,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.360]   I thought, "That's the mystery of marriage.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.220]   "You love her to make her lovely.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.740]   "You don't love her merely because she is lovely.
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.700]   "She's not gonna be as 20-something lovely
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   "at 70-something, so you better love her into loveliness,"
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.860]   which is exactly what Christ does for us.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.460]   So I would push on the young John Piper,
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.020]   and I would say, "Yeah, you married a very pretty girl here,
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.880]   "and you're all excited about lots of things about her.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.080]   "You better not let that be the main way you relate to her.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.240]   "Otherwise, it's gonna backfire on you
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.720]   "because you'll be constantly drawing your strength
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.700]   "for love from her lovableness
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.760]   "instead of from Christ's love for you
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.440]   "and in the gospel, which you now love her with
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.420]   "so that she's lovely in your love."
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.560]   I'd really push on that.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.640]   And then I would say,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.520]   "Let this, John Piper, be a breaking of your heart,
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.540]   "that you do not love her like this.
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.620]   "Let this drive you to Christ for forgiveness
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.560]   "and for justification and for renewal.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   "Let your high role as a Christ-like leader
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.240]   "break your heart, that you are not a Christ-like leader,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.240]   "and so lead you to lead with all patience and humility."
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.140]   And then I'd say, and this is just real personal
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.900]   because that's what she asked for,
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:07.240]   "John Piper, you're young, and you need to realize
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.720]   "that this is gonna be a problem for you all your life.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   "Be done with little boy need for pity,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.980]   "for mommy to kiss the owie and dote over you
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.960]   "till you get better.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.680]   "Be done with that.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.040]   "Be done with pouting and sulking
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.900]   "when you don't get what you want,
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.900]   "which is so immature and so built into your wiring,
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.300]   "and you will be regularly disappointed
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.220]   "because you are an intense perfectionistic wanter,
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.920]   "and therefore your wants are not going to be satisfied
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.240]   "as often as you would like.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.240]   "And so instead of pouting and pitying yourself,
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.340]   "draw down strength, John Piper.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.440]   "Draw down strength from Christ
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.340]   "to stop being a reactor
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.200]   "and instead be a strong initiative taker in hope.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.260]   "Bring hope to this family.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.040]   "Bring strength to this family.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.440]   "Don't use this family,
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.280]   "and when they don't meet your needs,
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.900]   "go pouting off into a corner.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.140]   "Come from the corner with Christ,
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.880]   "back into the family with strength and with hope.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.260]   "They need you to be a leader,
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.440]   "not to return evil for evil."
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.780]   And that's the last thing I'd say probably is,
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.300]   be tenderhearted, John.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.400]   Be tender-mouthed, John.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   Be tender-handed with your fingers, John,
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.420]   with this woman, even in her harshest moments.
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.840]   Don't return harsh for harsh.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.180]   Don't return blunt for blunt.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.360]   Don't return hurt for hurt.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.600]   A soft answer may restore her soul.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.920]   So, remember, John Piper, this marriage is temporary.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.760]   It's a shadow, not a reality.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.200]   There's not gonna be any marriage or giving
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.600]   in marriage in heaven, and so it's a parable, John,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.080]   pointing to something vastly greater.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.880]   Go there to Jesus and his relationship to you.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.280]   Get all the strength you need, and then come back,
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.360]   and yes, savor this gift now.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.480]   Don't belittle this gift.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.320]   It's a real gift.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.840]   It's a beautiful gift.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.300]   Savor the sex, and savor the friendship,
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.900]   and savor the mutuality of all of life,
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.840]   but know it's always pointing to something greater,
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.920]   something real with Christ.
