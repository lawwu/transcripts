[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - So how deep do the roots of language go in our brain?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   Our mind, is it yet another feature like vision
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.280]   or is it something more fundamental
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.280]   from which everything else springs in the human mind?
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.500]   - Well, in a way it's like vision.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.340]   There's something about our genetic endowment
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.380]   that determines that we have a mammalian
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.480]   rather than an insect visual system.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.200]   And there's something in our genetic endowment
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.220]   that determines that we have a human language faculty.
[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.960]   No other organism has anything remotely similar.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.040]   So in that sense, it's internal.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.060]   Now there is a long tradition, which I think is valid,
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.280]   going back centuries to the early scientific revolution,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.080]   at least, that holds that language is the,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.400]   sort of the core of human cognitive nature.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.860]   It's the source, it's the mode for constructing thoughts
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.520]   and expressing them, that is what forms thought.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.960]   And it's got fundamental creative capacities.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.040]   It's free, independent, unbounded, and so on.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.600]   And undoubtedly, I think the basis
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.220]   for our creative capacities
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.220]   and the other remarkable human capacities
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.260]   that lead to the unique achievements
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.040]   and not so great achievements of the species.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.340]   - The capacity to think and reason,
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.980]   do you think that's deeply linked with language?
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.620]   Do you think the way we, the internal language system
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.340]   is essentially the mechanism
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.900]   by which we also reason internally?
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.700]   - It is undoubtedly the mechanism by which we reason.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.100]   There may also be other,
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.540]   there are undoubtedly other faculties
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.620]   involved in reasoning.
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.300]   We have a kind of scientific faculty,
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.620]   nobody knows what it is,
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.700]   but whatever it is that enables us
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.220]   to pursue certain lines of endeavor and inquiry
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.540]   and to decide what makes sense and doesn't make sense
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.980]   and to achieve a certain degree
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.380]   of understanding of the world,
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.260]   that uses language but goes beyond it.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.780]   Just as using our capacity for arithmetic
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.980]   is not the same as having the capacity.

[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.900]   (air whooshing)
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.560]   (air whooshing)
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.220]   (air whooshing)
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.880]   (air whooshing)
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.540]   (air whooshing)
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:53.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
