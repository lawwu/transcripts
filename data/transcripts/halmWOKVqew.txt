[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   (projector whirring)
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:18.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.100]   - You know it's real when you edit it.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.160]   - We're good? - Yeah, we're good.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.880]   - Welcome to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.860]   Usually I'm 750 miles away from Duncan.
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.680]   Today I'm 75 inches away.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.560]   We're at the headquarter,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.600]   the Compound headquarters in Manhattan.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.040]   Nice to be here.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.480]   Duncan, how we feeling?
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.680]   - I'm stressed.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.880]   I'm feeling pretty stressed today.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.720]   - It's my tea issues, but hey, we're past that.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.400]   We're ready to answer some questions.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.760]   Remember, our email here, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.640]   Let's do it.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.400]   - Okay, and in our defense, this is a tight turnaround.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   You guys saw from we were doing CNBC with Josh to this,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.440]   so we apologize for the delay.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.320]   But yeah, we're here now.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.080]   So up first today, we have the following.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.480]   I like my idea of investing every day.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.240]   My OCD took off and I figured out
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.220]   that investing $25 a day over 260 weekdays in a year
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.640]   would roughly equal my IRA limit of 6,500.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.480]   The investing platform I use allows me
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.240]   to automate this task over a basket of stocks and ETFs.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.480]   My question is, some of my $25 a day investment
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.700]   equates to only a couple dollars per share/ETF.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.840]   Does payment for order flow
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.880]   negatively impact my smaller trades
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880]   more than if I made larger weekly or monthly trades?
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.840]   Is this impossible to quantify
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.400]   with fluctuations in the markets?
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.520]   Should I just take a deep breath
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.220]   and not be all OCD about it?
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.160]   - I like the idea here.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.760]   So one of the biggest benefits of dollar cost averaging
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.760]   is just that you're diversifying over time, right?
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.520]   You avoid that single point of failure
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.600]   where you take the big lump sum and you put it to work
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.680]   and it happens to be at an inopportune time.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.760]   So I do like the idea of breaking down
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.740]   the max IRA contributions into various timeframes.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.900]   Technically, there's 252 trading days in the year
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.460]   because of holidays.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.260]   So if we're splitting hairs here,
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.340]   we're talking about $26 a day.
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.700]   If a man really wants to max out that IRA,
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.460]   which he does, it sounds like, close enough.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.460]   Or you could go, I figured, at $125 a week, $540 a month.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.100]   So I think any of those times,
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.020]   honestly, if you're breaking them down into those levels,
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.240]   even if you did it monthly, if you did one lump sum,
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.620]   your market impact is gonna be so minuscule
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.140]   of the trillions of dollars that are moving all the time
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.500]   that it's probably not going to matter.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.360]   So I think they probably are overthinking things.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.460]   I just don't see how you can get taken advantage of any more
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.860]   at $125 a week versus 25 a day or $540 a month.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.780]   I think at these levels,
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.320]   you're not gonna be any better or worse off.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.960]   Ken Griffith is not going to take any more pennies from you.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.820]   It kind of just scales, I think.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.660]   So we did talk about mental accounting though last week.
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.180]   And I do think the idea of someone thinking
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.940]   through their savings as $25 a day
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.820]   is easier to stomach psychologically
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.420]   than $540 a month for certain people.
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.620]   So even though it's the same thing in the end,
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.280]   I actually like the idea of doing it this way.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.020]   So I think investing this way could provide
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.260]   some sort of double psychological boost
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.740]   in terms of dollar cost averaging
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.340]   and spreading it out over tons of different markets.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.820]   And I've shared this stat before.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.500]   I think since 1928, the win-loss ratio
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.020]   for the stock market on a daily basis
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.820]   is 55% up days, 45% down days.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.580]   So $25 a day, you're actually giving yourself
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.860]   that opportunity to buy
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.300]   when the market is down a little bit.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.940]   But as an individual investor, the trading cost thing,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.980]   it's not like it's gonna scale any better.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.700]   And it's not like you're gonna get
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.980]   the scale of an institutional investor
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.100]   by moving millions or hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.080]   Either way, so I think, yeah,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.300]   you're probably overthinking it.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.180]   - And so for payment for order flow,
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.540]   I mean, we are talking about like pennies
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.740]   and fractions of pennies, right?
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.660]   We're just to be queer for people.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.980]   - And yeah, we're talking about a drop in the bucket though,
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.220]   a drop in the ocean here in terms of that $25 a day.
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.140]   It's not gonna be any better,
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.940]   even if you put that $6,500 max IRA contribution
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.780]   to work all at once.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.980]   - I've never seen a dude dollar cost average daily.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.640]   It's the first time I've thought about that.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.480]   I think it's kind of fun.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.320]   It's like paying a bill, right?
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.940]   Buy your coffee, fund your IRA.
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.160]   I dig it.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.700]   - Yeah, let us know in the chat.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.820]   I'm not looking at the chat right now,
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.980]   but let us know, Nicole's in there.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.020]   So let us know if you dollar cost average on a daily basis.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.940]   - Let's do another one.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.220]   - Yeah, up next we have bonds versus money markets.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.620]   I manage my investment portfolio largely
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.300]   with a mix of very boring funds,
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.600]   U.S. index fund, international index fund,
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.180]   and a total bond fund.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.100]   Looking at the yield on my bond index fund,
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.340]   it looks like I may be able to get a better yield
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.540]   in a money market fund.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.820]   Is there any reason to keep my bond allocation
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.260]   where it is rather than moving into a money market fund?
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.100]   - First of all, kudos on a three fund portfolio.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.920]   I love this.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.580]   The total stock market index funds,
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.280]   the U.S., international, and bonds.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.780]   Listen, the yield on the 10 year treasury
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.720]   is like 3.6% right now.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.300]   So you can get four to 5% in most money market funds.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.140]   Three to six month treasuries right now
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.900]   are yielding around 5%.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.980]   And if the Fed raises rates at the next meeting,
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.340]   which most people don't think they will,
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.700]   but some people think it's a possibility,
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.740]   these rates should actually go up a little more from here.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.280]   So I said on this week's Animal Spirits,
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.300]   I think owning ultra short term bonds
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.620]   is a no brainer right now.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.420]   But that's kind of how I look at fixed income
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.780]   as an asset class.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.380]   I prefer to accept my volatility in stocks.
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.020]   I know the stock market is gonna fluctuate in the short term
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.580]   and it could have these bone crushing losses.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.860]   And I look to fixed income and cash
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.600]   as a portfolio stabilizer.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.380]   So I think about portfolios in like a barbell approach.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.700]   So on one side of the barbell is higher volatility,
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.540]   higher expected returns.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.160]   And on the other side of the barbell is less volatility,
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.140]   maybe some income, but we're talking more stability
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.140]   for either rebalancing into the downturn in the stock market
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.860]   or just keeping that portfolio stabilized
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.880]   so you have some spending cash on part of it,
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.080]   that sort of bucketing approach we've talked about.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.700]   So in a recent piece,
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.940]   my favorite financial writer, William Bernstein,
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.260]   he was talking about bonds and cash versus stock.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.540]   And he said, "Investing is an operation
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.340]   "that transfers wealth to those with a strategy
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.220]   "and can execute it from those who do not."
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.040]   Sorry, let me show that again.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.860]   "Investing is an operation that transfers wealth
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.040]   "to those with a strategy and can execute it
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.980]   "from those who do not or cannot."
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.960]   And the idea is having some sort of short duration assets,
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.220]   whether it's cash or cash-like short-term bonds, CDs,
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.380]   money markets, online savings, whatever it is,
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.900]   that can help you stick with the other stuff.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.700]   So even in the last 10 or 15 years
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.860]   when cash or cash-like investments
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.020]   didn't provide much in the way of yield,
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.380]   the asset class still played a vital role
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.420]   in portfolio management
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.620]   if it allowed you to stay invested in stocks
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.480]   and avoid worrying about your short-term spending needs
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.320]   being met.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.180]   So the good J.P. Morgan line was always,
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.300]   "A bear marker is when stocks
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.140]   "are returned to the rightful owners."
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.620]   And I think most people might,
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.060]   what that means is the people who have money
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.100]   to buy stocks are on sale.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.020]   And unless you have savings coming in from income,
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.700]   the people who have money are the people holding cash
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.200]   and can sort of balance into the pain.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.300]   So that's just my preference
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.500]   when it comes to portfolio management diversification,
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.480]   not for everyone.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.620]   It does seem like a no-brainer
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.540]   to sit in these short-term vehicles right now,
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.260]   but there are some risks to consider
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.460]   before you move your entire bond exposure over.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.820]   Like if you were sitting in a total bond market fund,
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.140]   last year you probably lost
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.420]   somewhere in the range of 10 to 15%
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.380]   in like an ag or a total bond index fund.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.540]   Interest rate risk works in both directions.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.740]   So last year when rates rose,
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.900]   long-duration bonds got hammered.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.860]   So John, do a chart on here of last year.
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.700]   This is bonds at different duration rates.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.420]   So you can see that zero-coupon bonds,
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.140]   which is 25-plus years,
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.100]   they were down 40-some percent last year.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.820]   That's like all sorts of duration.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.940]   That's all duration, basically.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.420]   20 to 30-year, kind of going on the list,
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.860]   then one to three-year didn't have many losses.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.780]   So the further out duration, the more you lost.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.080]   Now, throw this year's chart up, John.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.700]   Not huge gains in bonds,
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.820]   but it kind of works the opposite direction
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.940]   'cause rates have fallen this year.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.460]   So anything with duration did much better.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.620]   So if we go into recession and the Fed cuts rates
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.220]   or yields in the bond market fall
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.300]   'cause of inflation or whatever, the economy's slowing,
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.220]   which you would expect to happen,
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.540]   bonds with more duration will provide
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.380]   more bang for your buck.
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.380]   So making up some of those losses,
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.340]   if you kind of get out now,
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.920]   is much easier if you stay in some duration.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.700]   Some investors like this feature of bonds.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.740]   When the stock market is down, usually,
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.380]   not last year, but usually, or when there's a recession,
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.180]   we see a flight to safety, people go into bonds,
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.900]   and bonds provide some sort of price boost
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.980]   and not just income.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.380]   Reinvestment risk is also a potential problem here.
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.860]   Let's say the Fed overplays its hand,
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.580]   do get even like a run-of-the-mill recession
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.220]   and inflation falls.
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.220]   I don't know, rates could go from 5% currently
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.740]   to 3% or 2%, maybe,
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.060]   depending on the severity of the downturn.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.500]   In short-term bonds or cash or money markets or whatever,
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.100]   you don't get price appreciation from rates falling
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.220]   like you would in long-duration bonds.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.780]   Plus, now your 5% T-bill is now yielding 2%.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.020]   So you kind of have to think, what do I do?
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.540]   Do I stick it out in this more stable asset
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.260]   or do I look for something that can potentially,
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.540]   in that scenario, get more yield?
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.980]   So I think you will have a heads-up from the Fed
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.380]   when time comes and rates move,
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.980]   but the bond market's not gonna wait around for you.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.660]   So I think you just have to figure out
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.620]   why you're investing in bonds in the first place.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.540]   Is it more stability, like me,
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.900]   or are you trying to get ahead of the interest rate market
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.380]   and be some sort of hedge fund manager?
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.020]   I guess that's kind of the way I look at it.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.060]   - Have you taken a look at how much
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.940]   does the price appreciation help in fixed income
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.500]   when markets are in turmoil?
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.980]   - Over the long, well, so we have looked at that,
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.260]   and during, I think, the relative outperformance
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.060]   and down year in the stock market,
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.300]   it's like, again, stocks are down and bonds are up a little.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.980]   It's like almost a 20% outperformance
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.740]   on a relative basis for the 10-year Treasury.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.620]   So you do get a bump.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.700]   Like in 2008, Treasuries were up double digits.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.780]   So that is something to consider.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.220]   Like, what is the point of fixed income
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.260]   in the first place for you?
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.580]   - Yeah, and that would be my argument
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.380]   is that you will get that price appreciation
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.580]   from a money market fund, right?
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.860]   You get yield and yield alone.
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.940]   - Yes, you have the stability piece and the income piece,
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.660]   but that's it, right?
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.940]   - I do think bonds have been a really tough asset class
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:02.900]   for the past 10 years or so,
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.340]   and I think they're pretty straightforward to me
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.460]   in terms of this, but that's the wrench in the equation.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.900]   - Pretty exciting right now, the last year or so, yeah.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.380]   - And that's the thing.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.900]   Interest rates have fluctuated so much.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.300]   Maybe some people are saying,
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.580]   "Just get me out of this game.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.420]   "I don't care.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.940]   "I'm gonna lock in what I can now,
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:18.980]   "and if rates go down in the future,
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.100]   "we'll figure it out then."
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.140]   But I do think rates being at 5% in short-term T-bills
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.940]   is something that investors haven't had the chance
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.580]   for 15, 20 years at this point.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.900]   I'd say enjoy 'em while they last.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.660]   - In a word, it's tasty.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.500]   - I gotta be honest.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.860]   I still don't understand what a money market fund
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.500]   really is at the end of the day.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.060]   I really couldn't explain it.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.460]   I have no idea.
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.980]   It's like a fancy bank account.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.180]   - It's a fancy savings account, it really is,
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.740]   but you can write checks on it.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.820]   It really is a fancy savings account.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.580]   This is the Winnie the Pooh meme.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.260]   Savings account, money market.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.660]   It's not really a savings account, but it kind of is.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.500]   - Yeah, but there's a distinction between that
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.740]   and a money market mutual fund.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.860]   - We'd have to go through the financialization history
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.220]   to explain it all.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.060]   - Oh, we have time.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.100]   - I don't know that from Shinola.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.580]   14 minutes for this episode.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.860]   - Okay, up next we have,
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.540]   and that question was from Michael, by the way.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.180]   Up next we have a long one, but a good one.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.860]   I got laid off from a tech startup in New York City.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.780]   Shocker.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.420]   I'm 30, single, and have been wanting to do something
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.540]   on my own for years.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.620]   I have experience, relationships, and a decent idea
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.660]   to bring a niche product to market.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.720]   I need about $100,000 to live and fund the business
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.380]   for year one, assuming no positive cashflow.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.140]   How would you approach setting up funding?
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.340]   I have $25,000 cash, negligible debt, good credit,
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:39.000]   about $50,000 in a brokerage, about $75,000 in a 401(k).
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.300]   I'll probably never have fewer responsibilities in my life,
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.580]   and it feels like the right time to make a bet on myself.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.940]   I've meant to, I totally forgot
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.400]   in all the hectic prep for this.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.300]   I was gonna read this like a shark pitch,
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.500]   like say, "Hey sharks, what are the pros and cons
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.960]   "of liquidating my brokerage account, a 401(k) loan,
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.720]   "taking an SBA or bank loan,
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.400]   "raising from angels, friends, and family?"
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.080]   - I like the idea here, like good for you
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.880]   for betting on yourself.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.720]   You definitely wanna do this in your 20s or 30s
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.320]   before you have more responsibilities as a single person.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.040]   You don't have kids running around
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.920]   or a mortgage to worry about.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.140]   I think that is, there's, risk means different people
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.800]   at different points of their life, and I think this,
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.400]   if you're gonna do it and you make this leap, do it.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.760]   - Obviously the caveat here is most startups fail,
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.760]   you know, which is tough, but I do think it's,
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.000]   this is the time to do this.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.040]   So, Bill, you've actually been a part
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.740]   of small businesses over the years.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.200]   Not necessarily a startup per se,
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.400]   but Ritholtz was more or less a startup
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.800]   when you and I joined seven or eight years ago.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.520]   - I think so, yeah. - There was a handful of us.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.560]   - Yeah, Mr. Josh Brown, Mr. Barry Ritholtz.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.080]   - Well, let's ask you this before we get into like the,
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.400]   weighing the pros and cons of each.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.360]   Are there any tax implications here of starting a business
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.580]   and different kind of funding approaches?
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.880]   Does that matter at all?
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.880]   - Yeah, there's a lot of tax implications.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.120]   I was gonna suggest, Ben, that we end up ranking these,
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.200]   right, I mean, at the end of this, this is priorities.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.740]   And before we get there, I wanna tell you a quick story.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.080]   So the year's 2007, the great financial crisis
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.980]   is a year or two away, and I picked the perfect time
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.040]   to get out of the Army, leave a stable job,
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.440]   not unlike my friend Chris here, and get out.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.040]   I linked up with a tax practice partner,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.920]   my partner Greg, who turned 78 this year,
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.160]   and by the way, he's still cranking out tax returns
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.560]   on an annual basis, that man is my hero
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.760]   and very much a mentor.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.200]   So I go to the bank, 'cause I wanna focus on CFP,
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.040]   I wanna become a financial planner,
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.280]   work with the tax practice.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.240]   So I go to the bank and I say,
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.360]   what kind of deal can we work here?
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.000]   You know, I slip the note under the table,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.720]   and then hard pass, hard pass from the bank.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.400]   I go talk to the SBA.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.120]   Personal guarantee, they could give me $2,000 at 12%.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   Not very helpful if I wanna hire somebody.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.200]   - At that point, you might as well get a credit card.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   - Right, basically.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.720]   Went to the Veterans Affairs, funding had dried up,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.760]   again, this is 2007, not an asset-backed loan.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.200]   I go to the county, I'm not adding manufacturing jobs.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.320]   A finance bro, they're probably not just gonna
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.920]   loan you money at the end of this.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.800]   So ultimately, maybe things have changed,
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.520]   but I think, Chris, every note on your list
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.320]   involves you basically betting on yourself
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.840]   with your own financial resources, except for one.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.560]   And that's the one that I would focus on,
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.120]   which is the friends and family element.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.600]   That, to me, is the most interesting thing to go,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.400]   because ultimately, crowdsourcing would allow
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.880]   other people to share in the risk that he's taking on
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.120]   with his career right now.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.600]   And that way, you're able to financialize it a little bit,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.400]   and for tax implications, if somebody's gonna put risk in,
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.180]   they would also share with them a little bit of the upside
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.020]   in how you do that.
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.120]   But that's the direction I would go.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.200]   - If you have trusted sources of capital
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.860]   that are willing to make a bet on you,
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.080]   and they understand the risks,
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.680]   that you could lose all this money,
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.440]   and then also, hey, I'm gonna be using
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.740]   some of my brokerage account here.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.200]   I'm gonna be maybe using credit card.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.560]   I'm gonna bootstrap this, and I'm gonna do whatever I can.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.140]   If they know that you've got skin in the game, too,
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.360]   where you're just not using a loan or something,
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.880]   I think that makes a lot of sense, too,
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.720]   as long as they go into it with their eyes wide open
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.800]   that this could be a zero for them.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.360]   And so, if you finance half of it with the $50,000 you have,
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.560]   half brokerage, half cash,
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.160]   if you can raise another $50,000 from friends, family,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.460]   maybe it's something where you pay 'em back
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.160]   one-fifth a year for six years, right?
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.000]   And so, they get paid.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.040]   They get the 20% kinda kicker there at the end
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.080]   if you split it up, but know that you're five,
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.320]   and that allows you to financialize
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.520]   and spread out some of the risk.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.760]   Look at a partnership LLC.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.080]   That's certainly a great structure.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.920]   Would Elliot have folks enter and exit the partnership
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.460]   with little, no tax consequences?
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.880]   That's where I'd go for Chris,
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.640]   but I'd like that crowdsourcing idea.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.660]   That one stands out to me.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.140]   - I'm not a big American exceptionalism guy,
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.280]   but I think this is one of the cool things
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.520]   about our country that people do try this,
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.120]   because I'm not, you know,
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.480]   again, real estate's kind of a startup here,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.280]   but it wasn't like starting from the ground floor,
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.560]   and I think that's just a huge risk,
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.760]   and you have to be the right kind of person, too,
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.440]   and have the right personality to do something like that.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.820]   - Right, but it's capable here.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.080]   Manifest destiny, and for here, you can make it.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.160]   I mean, this is the American dream.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.580]   - And kudos to him for giving it a try,
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.760]   and if it doesn't work, guess what?
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.120]   You work in tech startups.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.240]   That's a place where you can see large amounts of people
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.400]   lose their job pretty quickly,
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.920]   and why not give it a try,
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.280]   and if you can, get back in with techs on the upswing again.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.080]   - Yeah, he could get an entry-level, you know,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.760]   200K job in tech or something, right, you know,
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.440]   if he always had, if he had to fall back.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.600]   - Inflation, inflation works wonders.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.440]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.260]   - Congrats, Chris.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.100]   - Yeah, good luck.
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.040]   Keep us posted on how it goes.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.080]   - Yeah, let us know.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.160]   Okay, up next, question four, we've got--
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.740]   - Also, he's probably gonna ask us to invest.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.580]   (laughing)
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.420]   I don't know what he said.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.680]   - Oh, there's an idea, Chris.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.520]   There's an idea.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.640]   Okay, up next.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.520]   I've gotten into dividend investing recently
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.320]   and need some clarification on the difference
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.580]   between ordinary and qualified dividends.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.760]   I want qualified dividends
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.680]   because of the preferential tax treatment.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.080]   The IRS states that most American companies
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.800]   and some foreign stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.280]   will be qualified dividends
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.360]   as long as you hold them for 60 days.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.080]   How do you easily screen for equities
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.680]   that will produce qualified dividends?
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.240]   So he's basically looking to build a portfolio
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.200]   where he's getting tax advantage dividends, right?
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.040]   Smart.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.200]   - So, obviously, the first explanation here
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.760]   is qualified versus ordinary.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.840]   Let's do, Ben tries to explain taxes.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.100]   (laughing)
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.640]   Ordinary just means they're taxed at ordinary income, right?
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.480]   - That's it.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.600]   - Qualified means you get some sort
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.520]   of preferential treatment at whatever,
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.480]   capital gains or whatever.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.120]   What would be classified as ordinary?
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.640]   That's like REITs.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.520]   - Yeah, REITs is a good one.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.240]   The most common one, I was gonna get it to the end,
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.280]   but you just put it first, Ben,
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.520]   is income from a bond fund.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.040]   Income from a bond fund is typically taxed
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.160]   as a non-qualified dividend,
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.760]   but that's not what the question's trying to get at.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.120]   - Right, so they wanna know,
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.320]   what stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds do I invest in
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.320]   if I want qualified dividends?
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.160]   - Yeah, so first off, let's start with the why.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160]   Why, you said it, Ben.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.240]   Ordinary income stings, and it can be a 0% rate,
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.320]   but all the way up to about 41%
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.040]   for investors in the highest tax brackets,
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.560]   making about $600,000 or more if you're married.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.080]   However, most median taxpayers are paying about 22%.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.960]   Now, a qualified dividend, it's the same tax rate
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.280]   that you would apply to long-term capital gains.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.720]   So for most investors, that's 15%.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.840]   At the very high end, it ends up being 24%.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.600]   And so the gap there can be pretty large.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.920]   It can almost be a 15% differential
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.960]   between your tax rate for ordinary income
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.360]   versus qualified capital gains or qualified dividends.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.200]   So that's step one.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.240]   What do you get from that?
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   So now, how do you get a qualified dividend?
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.800]   There's really two conditions you need to hit.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.880]   Number one, it needs to be a U.S. company.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.000]   That's task number one.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.200]   However, counted in that qualified dividend
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.680]   for U.S. purposes are countries
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.600]   that we have a favorable tax treaty with.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.560]   Ben, what countries do you favor
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.920]   when it comes to your tax treaties?
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.040]   - Saudi Arabia?
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.880]   - That is actually one, yes.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.840]   - Is it really? - That's a really good one.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.680]   Yeah, 'cause they're friends.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.440]   They're friends of the United States, definitely.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.640]   But yeah, Japan. - What about Ireland?
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.520]   - Ireland, big one.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.640]   Yep, big up there on the list.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.640]   I mean, I can give you a full list.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.280]   The list is longer than a list of not.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   - Could you give us your picks?
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.120]   - Sure. (laughs)
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.480]   - That's what everyone's waiting on.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.080]   - I'll give you my qualified dividend list,
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.040]   which is Canada, Mexico, UK, Germany, China, Japan,
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.800]   Switzerland, India, South Korea, Italy,
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.240]   and the list goes on and on and on.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.320]   A lot of the developed world.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.800]   What's interesting is if you look at the countries
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.160]   that are not included in the qualified dividend list.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.640]   I'll give you one, Taiwan.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.000]   This is a country, by the way,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.400]   but Taiwan is not included
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.120]   because we don't have a favorable tax treaty.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.280]   Taiwan Semiconductor,
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.920]   one of the 10 largest companies in the world,
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.360]   dividend rate about 2.5%.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.640]   Sorry, you gotta pay full freight of U.S. taxes.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.760]   It's not qualified.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.600]   Another example, Singapore, Colombia, Iran.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.720]   Not really good friends with Iran right now,
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.520]   but the differences can just be in that tax treaty thing.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.800]   - So it's pretty easy to find qualified dividends.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.840]   - It is, it is.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.320]   And the second thing you need to hit is a holding period.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.040]   And the holding period is super funky.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.580]   Don't wanna get too much into details,
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.640]   but you basically need to hold the stock
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.640]   for a 61-day period at least 60 days prior
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.560]   to the dividend being held.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.440]   And so the holding period test
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.160]   goes all the way back six months,
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.720]   and you basically have to hold the stock
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.760]   for about two months,
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.720]   at least two months before the dividend.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.140]   So we're looking at a long timeframe.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.080]   And what this prevents, Ben,
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.720]   is people buying a company that's about to issue a dividend
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.980]   and then they sell it later.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.680]   So you have to hold this as a long-term investors game,
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.520]   and if you meet those criteria.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.320]   - Right, I hope you're not day-trading dividend stocks.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.520]   That's not the point. - Day-trading dividend stocks
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.680]   turns out not to be a great strategy.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.000]   - Now let's take this one step further.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.680]   Since I wanna do dividends,
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.320]   do you think it almost always makes sense
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.920]   to hold dividends in a tax-squared account,
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.760]   if you can?
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.600]   If this person is saying,
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.120]   I wanna be a dividend investor,
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.480]   obviously, they're obviously asking
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.000]   for a taxable account here,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.160]   but would it be better for them
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.680]   to hold it in a Roth or an IRA?
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.840]   - It's really interesting,
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.840]   'cause tax location, I think, is all of a sudden
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.680]   back in vogue.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.560]   'Cause all of a sudden, if you can get 4%, 5%,
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.600]   we talked about treasury rate,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.940]   a money market rate of 3%,
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.600]   that does change the math and equation a little bit.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.280]   Tax location, a really good idea.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.480]   I'm not, I think at higher levels of dollars,
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.320]   that makes a lot of sense.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.120]   I think for solving for a portfolio question like this,
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.800]   I would just stick to the basics.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.780]   It's really just, you need to hold your stocks
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.920]   for a long period of time, and you're good to go.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.880]   - Okay, that's easy.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.960]   Cool, keep it easy.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.280]   - All right, last question, Duncan.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.440]   - Okay, so last but not least,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.400]   I work at a company that offers a 401(k) with no match
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.400]   and a tax-deferred Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan,
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.680]   or SERP, that's how I'm going to say it.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.120]   I don't know if that's right.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.200]   Not to brag.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.280]   They recently added the option to contribute
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.840]   to an after-tax 401(k) with automatic conversion
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.760]   to a Roth 401(k). - I think about three people
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.120]   listening got that not to brag.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.480]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   So yeah, they recently added the option
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.120]   to contribute to an after-tax 401(k)
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.320]   with automatic conversion to Roth 401(k),
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.560]   as well as the option to do an in-plan rollover
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.360]   of existing traditional 401(k) funds to Roth 401(k).
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.720]   I'm 38 and in my high-earning years.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.740]   If I did the mega back to a Roth,
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.960]   I would be paying tax on the conversion
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.020]   while in this high tax bracket.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.440]   Wouldn't it make more sense to contribute
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.840]   as much as possible to the SERP
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.400]   in order to max out pre-tax retirement savings
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.640]   and pay tax on withdrawals from the SERP during retirement
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.800]   when I'm in a lower tax bracket?
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.560]   I understand there's a risk of losing funds in a SERP
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.040]   if the company files for bankruptcy,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.960]   but my employer is owned by the world's
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.680]   largest asset management firm,
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.120]   so I see little risk of that happening.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.520]   Wow, they're feeling pretty good,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.440]   feeling pretty good about themselves.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.760]   - So the executive retirement plan
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.480]   is probably not all that well-known,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.200]   so why don't you explain to us that one
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.480]   and why it's contributing to income inequality.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.820]   - Yeah, I have precisely one client with a SERP.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.760]   So this is a rare-- - Really, okay.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.080]   - Yeah, this is a rare advantage.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.760]   - I have not heard much about these, I gotta be honest.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.560]   - Very cool, but they've fallen into this bucket
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.560]   of non-qualified retirement plans,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.080]   and ultimately, it is just a compensation structure.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.920]   The company's giving you an IOU,
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.520]   and they're saying, "Instead of paying you now,
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.500]   "is it cool if we pay you later?"
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.800]   That's what's going on here.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.680]   And part of the qualification rules are
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.120]   that the company's only allowed,
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.840]   due to U.S. Department of Labor rules,
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.520]   to fund a certain amount for certain people
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.240]   at certain times, and this allows them to go beyond that.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.440]   But as a condition of that, the SERP is not,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.780]   they don't set the money aside.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.200]   They cannot budget the money
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.960]   and put it into an account for you.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.960]   It's literally an IOU from the company
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.120]   saying that, "We're promised, don't worry about it.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.320]   "We're gonna pay you later."
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.440]   I think for highly compensated executives
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.880]   in a large, stable firm, it's a really valuable option,
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.980]   something to consider,
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.600]   especially sometimes there's not a choice.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.840]   It's like, look, this is part of your compensation package.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.380]   This isn't an optional plan.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.080]   But the downside is, as Martin gets to,
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.460]   is if the company goes under.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.640]   Big companies have failed, Ben.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.240]   General Motors, we're talking about Xerox.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.800]   Like, big companies have gone under.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.640]   - So if it goes under, that IOU is worthless.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.040]   - That IOU could be worthless.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.160]   It really depends on the courts.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.760]   And in bankruptcy, we're finding out
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.980]   with Silicon Valley Bank, it's not always what it seems.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.280]   But ultimately, you can expect your money
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.120]   to be about 10 up for a lot of time.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.720]   - Jim Carrey said IOUs are just as good as money.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.600]   (laughing)
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.440]   - That's the famous--
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.600]   - So I know you're a big Roth guy.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.440]   - Yeah.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.260]   - But does he have a point here?
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.800]   He says he's in his highest earning years
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.520]   and highest tax bracket.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.920]   Does it make sense for him to hold off
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.400]   on making those Roth conversions
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.500]   since he's paying big taxes now?
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.340]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.560]   And Martin, I don't know which state Martin's writing from,
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.800]   but let's presume it's New York.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.980]   Let's presume it's New Jersey.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.000]   Maybe in California, large asset manager.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.760]   I'm guessing that's not gonna be in Florida.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.160]   It could be, but I doubt it.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.500]   I think so, yes.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.640]   I think ultimately, Roth conversions are great.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.000]   Roth IRAs are fantastic.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.280]   They're a fantastic vehicle.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.120]   But if you're at the highest possible tax bracket,
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.360]   that's probably not the primary vehicle for you.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.040]   Martin's got his head in the right place here.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:34.880]   - Okay.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.040]   But he's talking about making contributions to these SERPs.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.480]   So that's just, he's making a contribution.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.320]   So are they making IOUs to each other?
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.700]   - It sounds like it's elective, yes.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.160]   He basically says, instead of getting my money today,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.360]   please pay it to me later.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.360]   And then he gets to defer the tax on that.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.520]   - Okay, and it allows you to make a bigger contribution,
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.360]   I would assume.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.180]   - More or less, yeah.
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.020]   But again, not a contribution
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.040]   because it's not in an account, it's not in a fund.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.560]   It's literally a promise for a future account.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.940]   - I feel like we're usually teaching Duncan
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.480]   about these acronyms.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.320]   I learned something today.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.160]   - Yeah, I had no idea.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.500]   I'd never, never heard of that.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.800]   Never encountered that.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.640]   - Yep.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.460]   - Okay.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.300]   - Yep, but it's good stuff.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.140]   They do track a value.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.120]   Again, it's just not immediately accessible.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.040]   - Okay.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:09.880]   Good stuff.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.700]   - I'll take your word for it.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.960]   - All right, cool.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.800]   - We appreciate the audience,
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.300]   everyone in the live chat for sticking with us.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.780]   We got a little bit of a late start today,
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.620]   but we had to do it from the compound here
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.780]   and Duncan was unplugging things, plugging things in.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.040]   - It's always exciting.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.740]   And anyone who's watching right now,
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.180]   that's the true hardcore audience.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.060]   So thank you, listener.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.900]   - Sure, yes.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.720]   - Thank you.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.560]   - Someone in the chat says
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.900]   that we need to give Duncan a Serp.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.720]   Just for-
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.560]   - Give me a Serp.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.380]   I still don't quite understand.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.220]   - Just for today.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.380]   - Sure, sounds good.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.900]   - No, we always appreciate your comments and feedback.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.740]   If you're watching on YouTube,
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.380]   leave us a question or a comment in the feed.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.180]   I always go through all the comments.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.100]   I'm a man of the people.
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.400]   If you have a question for us,
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.500]   email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.340]   What else?
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.160]   We need a review.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.260]   - Yeah, we need everything.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.100]   Give us everything.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.500]   - Give us a subscription.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.480]   - We also want you to go to the shop.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.320]   We have a shop.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.680]   Also, I wanted to say thanks to John,
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.620]   who you can't see on camera,
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.700]   but he's been running the show, basically,
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.540]   behind the scenes today.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.100]   So I basically threw this in his lap and said, good luck.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.520]   So thanks, John.
