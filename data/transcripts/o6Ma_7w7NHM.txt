[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   The words to which I should like to direct your attention this morning are to be found in Paul's
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:14.280]   epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6, reading verses 10 to 13. "Finally, my brethren, be strong
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.520]   in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.600]   to stand against the wiles of the devil." For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.920]   but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.160]   against spiritual wickedness in high places. "Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.880]   God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:56.560]   We are continuing our study and consideration of this most important and vital and urgent
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.480]   statement. The problem is, how are we to fight and to confront the wiles of the devil,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.960]   these principalities and powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world,
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.320]   the spiritual wickedness, even in high or heavenly places. And last Sunday morning I
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.120]   was pointing out that the Apostle says that there are two things which we have to bear in mind,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.160]   two things which are essential to us, if we are to stand and not to be defeated and to fall.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.080]   The first is, "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might." And the second is,
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.680]   "Take unto you the whole armor of God." And we are looking at these. Now I emphasized
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.840]   the importance of the order in which the Apostle puts them to us, the order therefore in which we
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.480]   must always take them. I am hoping to indulge a little in this later, but I would just again
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:00.400]   remind you in passing that these things must be taken in their due order. And the first is,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:09.040]   "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might." But the question is, what does that mean?
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.680]   It is a great phrase, but so often we sing hymns reminding us of that phrase, we read the Scriptures,
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.240]   but we find it very difficult to interpret this in practice and to know what it means
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.720]   exactly in ordinary daily life. Now then, that is the thing that we are proceeding to consider.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:40.200]   We have seen that it means this, that we must realize the need of the strength. That means,
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.600]   of course, realizing something about the character of the enemy that is set against us. We have spent
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.800]   almost a year in considering that. If you do not know the enemy, well, you are already defeated.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.120]   If you think life in this world is something easy, you are already defeated. No, we must realize our
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.400]   need of strength because of the power of the enemy. But secondly, we must realize our need
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.800]   of strength because of our own weakness. And a Christian who does not realize his own weakness
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:19.240]   is in the most precarious position possible. He is utterly ignorant. Any man who has self-confidence
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:28.640]   realizing the nature of the enemy set against us is just blind, is ignorant. His own weakness,
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.520]   we saw the importance of realizing something also of that. But then we ended on this note,
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.200]   and this is the positive one. We must realize his strength. "Be strong," says the apostle,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:51.520]   "in the Lord and the power of his might." The might of his strength. We ended on that note.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.600]   We mustâ€”it is the secret to every success in the Christian life, to know the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.120]   to know his inherent power and strength, and to know something about the manifestation of it.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.000]   And thank God we are given great instruction concerning that, as we saw in the Gospels.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.600]   How he could rebuke Satan, defeat him by quoting Scripture, how he could cast out devils,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.640]   how he triumphed at the cross over them all and in the resurrection. Well, there is his strength
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:36.040]   and his power. It is the Lord, the Almighty One, the Conqueror, over everything that is set not
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:44.240]   only against man but set against God. But now then, having realized that, that's where you start.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:54.200]   The next question that arises is this. Now, how exactly are we related to all that? It is one
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:02.280]   thing to remind ourselves of his almightiness, of the glorious power that resides in him,
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.920]   and that he has triumphed over all. How is that related to me? How does that help me? How does
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:17.680]   that avail me in my own personal problem and conflict and wrestling with these powers and
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.760]   forces that are set against me? And it's that we now proceed to consider together.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:31.480]   The first thing, it seems to me, that we must ever remember is this, that the Lord Jesus Christ is
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.680]   what the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews calls the Captain of our Salvation. Now, that's
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.440]   a phrase which you remember is used in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and it's used in different terms
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.480]   more than once. But that's the term that you get in the second chapter, in verse 10 in particular,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.760]   "For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.800]   glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings." Now, you've got
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:15.280]   the same idea in the twelfth chapter also, where he says, "Looking unto Jesus, the author and
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:23.920]   finisher of our faith." He's the kind of final leader, the leader, the originator, and the one
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.960]   who carries it on and who's leading us, the author and the finisher of our faith.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.400]   Now, here I say is the first thing that we have to realize. In other words, we must get a true
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:44.920]   conception of this salvation which we are enjoying. The danger always is, of course, to look at it in
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.760]   a purely personal and subjective manner. Now, we've got to do that. There are some people who
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.520]   never realize the personal side, and they're equally wrong. But it's wrong to go to either
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.840]   of these extremes. The danger so often is that we think of this whole position of ours in the
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.000]   Christian life as something that we've got to do. Well, I'm going to emphasize that we have a great
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.400]   deal to do. But before we come to that, we must never lose sight of this, that salvation is
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:23.840]   something that is of God. It is God's great plan. It is God's scheme. It is something that God is
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.360]   doing. It's something that God has planned and originated. He's initiated the movement,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.200]   and he's carrying it on. Now, this to me is one of the most fundamental things we can grasp in
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.720]   connection with this particular teaching. God is involved in this question of your salvation and
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:48.760]   ours much more than we are ourselves. Now, it's because we so often forget that, and think of it
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:54.400]   as primarily something that is ours and that we've got to do, and that we turn to God for help. Now,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:01.160]   that's quite the wrong way around. It's God's origin, and we are simply brought into it. Well,
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:09.480]   why does that help us? Well, it helps us in this way, that we must realize that we are individual
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:17.160]   units in a great army. We're not fighting some personal private war. That isn't the position
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:24.920]   at all. We are simply individual soldiers in a great army, which is fighting a great campaign.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:31.680]   In other words, the real thing, the ultimate thing, is not so much even my fight with the devil as
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.720]   God's fight with the devil. That's the way to look at it, and the moment you begin to do that,
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:45.960]   it gives you great strength. Well, take the obvious analogy. The private soldier there in
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:52.480]   the ranks or in the trenches during a great battle in a great war, he's not fighting a private battle.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:59.640]   He's not there because he's got some personal quarrel. No, no. He's just the unit in this
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:07.560]   great campaign. He doesn't decide the strategy, doesn't even decide the tactics. All that is in
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:14.040]   other hands. He's in it. He's been called into it. He's been put into his position, but it isn't his
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:20.840]   battle. It's the battle of the king or the queen or the country, and there is a general commanding,
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.600]   a captain of the salvation of the army and the fight. Now, that's the idea that is taught
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:31.680]   everywhere in the New Testament. And I know of nothing that is not only so comforting and
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:40.640]   solacing but so encouraging. Nothing which so lifts one up as to realize just this. If I may
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.880]   borrow a phrase that was used in the Old Testament, you remember, in connection with King Jehoshaphat,
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:52.120]   "The battle is not yours, but the Lord's." Now, that doesn't mean that he, as it were,
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.120]   had to do nothing, but he is being reminded that it wasn't some personal matter. It's God's ultimate,
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.680]   all the battles of Israel. If they could but have seen it, were not their battle. It was the battle
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.800]   of the Lord. They are his people. Their trouble was they always tended to forget the Lord and
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.760]   regarded it as their own battle and their own problem. So they indulged in their politics and
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.880]   in their alliances with Egypt and so on and got into trouble. If they'd only realized that they
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.000]   were fighting the battle of the Lord, the whole position would have been transformed. Well,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.840]   now that, I say, is the first principle which we must always grasp. The captain of your salvation.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:39.400]   Or look at that other astounding phrase used there in that tenth verse of the second chapter
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:48.960]   of that epistle to the Hebrews, "It became him," that's God, "it became him in leading many sons
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:55.760]   unto glory." It's he who's doing that. You and I are not fighting an individual battle trying to
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:02.360]   get to heaven. No, no. It's God who's bringing us unto glory. It's his scheme, it's his plan.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:11.960]   It's something that he's doing. It isn't ours. It became him in bringing many sons unto glory,
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.480]   to make the captain of their salvation. He's appointed a leader. He's appointed a captain.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:23.320]   To make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering. Now it became God. That's
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:30.880]   God's way, he says, of doing it. This is God's method. This is God's plan. Well, now I say,
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:37.520]   the moment we realize that, sure, the whole position is immediately transformed. Think
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.080]   of those soldiers fighting in their little sector, and things, they're being hard-pressed,
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.760]   and things are going against them. Now, if they begin to think that it's just their own private
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.960]   fight here, they'll soon go down. But they suddenly remember that they're involved in
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.440]   this great and mighty army, and then they remember the one who's planning it all at
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.720]   the back and directing it, the captain, the leader. The whole situation is transformed.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:08.960]   In other words, we've got to realize this, that as you and I are fighting this fight of faith,
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:15.800]   wrestling with these principalities and powers, facing the assaults of the world,
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:24.120]   and the flesh, and the devil, that God is involved in this with us. We'd never have
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.760]   been in it but for that. The ultimate battle is the battle between God and the devil,
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:36.280]   between heaven and hell, between light and darkness. And therefore we must realize this,
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:45.560]   that this is something that cannot fail, because God's honor is involved in it. Now,
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.240]   lift up your minds, therefore, and your hearts in the thick of the battle, and remember that.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.240]   You see the might and the power of the enemy, you're conscious of your own weakness. Yes,
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:01.760]   but we must say to ourselves, this is God's battle. We are having the privilege of being
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.480]   in it and fighting as individual soldiers, but God's honor is involved in all this.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:13.360]   God cannot allow this to fail, because his character, his own glory, his honor,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:21.600]   is involved in it all. Be strong in the Lord. Remember that he is there, and it is his battle.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:31.600]   This is a movement that he himself has made. How can we emphasize this too much? You see,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:38.200]   it's all there at the beginning of Genesis. God's perfect will. The devil comes in,
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   the woman and the men listen in their folly, and for the devil becomes the God of this world.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:52.920]   But you see, it isn't left at that. God didn't turn to the men and to the woman and say,
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.680]   "Very well, because of your rebellion and your folly and your sin, you brought all this upon
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:02.240]   yourselves, now get on with it. You brought it on yourselves very well. You'll have to fight now
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.720]   the rest of your lives against this evil power that has mastered you. Get on with it." That
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:14.640]   isn't what he said. He did say that there would be enmity between the seed of the woman and the
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.440]   seed of the serpent. He did say that, and that is true. That is this wrestling, this conflict.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:26.320]   But he didn't stop at that. He gave a promise. He's involved. Why? Well, because it's his world,
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.800]   and they're his people. He himself is concerned. He's not going to allow the devil to defeat him.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:41.160]   God cannot allow the evil one to mar his great work finally. Of course not. So God gives his
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.640]   promise about the seed of the woman that he's going to bruise that serpent's head. Now,
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:51.720]   God is involving himself. God's doing something about this. The whole movement of salvation is
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.960]   for God's glory, not simply for our deliverance, but for God's glory primarily. And our deliverance
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:04.320]   is only a part of this glory and honor for the great name of God. That's what he's saying. Be
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   strong in the Lord. Realize that. Get rid of this notion that it's just a little private battle that
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.960]   you are waging on your own. Strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. But come, let's go
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:25.520]   further. The second thing then we realize is this, that because of all that, that's the starting
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.400]   point. And I'm loath, you see, to leave it for this reason, that I know how ready we are to forget
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.840]   it, all of us. We are so subjective, and we're living in this unhealthy psychological generation
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.000]   that starts with men and ends with men. And all our troubles are due to that. We're always looking
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.760]   in and pitting ourselves and being sorry for ourselves, wanting something to help us. Get rid
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.520]   of that. Forget yourself for a moment. The battle is the Lord. Salvation is his. It's for the honor
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:58.320]   of his great and holy name. Very well, having started with that, realize this, that because
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:08.280]   of that, I say, that this almighty power is being exercised on our behalf. And that even when we
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:15.240]   don't realize it. There are things being done in this great, great campaign that we are not aware
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.760]   of. But though we are not aware of them, they're still being done. Here we perhaps asleep at our
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:26.960]   post. We don't realize that the great captain is planning something. And with respect to us,
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.320]   we are unconscious of it. It doesn't matter. Thank God that he does it, though we are unconscious,
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:39.960]   we'd all be lost were it not for that. He, I say, is exercising this power on our behalf.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:45.600]   Now, I've got nothing to do here but to quote scriptures to you. You see, the scripture is
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.720]   full of this teaching. And what we really need to know is our scriptures. Later on,
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:56.840]   we shall be reminded that the sword of the Spirit is the word of God. Exactly. Well,
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:04.560]   now listen to what it tells us. Take that Psalm 34, verse 7, "The angel of the Lord encampeth
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:14.840]   round about them that fear him, and delivereth them." You see, you think you're doing it all,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.960]   you're, the angel of the Lord is encamping round about you. And he's a very powerful angel. He's
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:27.560]   the angel of the Lord. He's got great might and power. And he's encamping round about them that
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:34.120]   fear him. Even when we are asleep, he's there. He's always on guard. He's watching for the
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.960]   reason I've given, that we are God's people. And that God's honor is involved in what happens to
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:44.320]   us. Very well, but listen to Psalm 91, "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:53.760]   shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty." What a place to be. You've seen those little
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:59.000]   chicks at the approach of danger, rushing to the hen, and she just spreads her wings,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.120]   and under they go. Under the shadow of the Almighty. That's true of all who are Christians.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:14.240]   Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Don't forget those wings. You shall abide
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:22.000]   under the shadow of the Almighty. Oh, I could go on endlessly, of course. I'm simply picking
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.600]   out certain great words. Listen to our Lord putting it in John 10, "No man shall be able
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:38.320]   to pluck them out of his hand." What a comfort, what a consolation. No man shall be able to pluck
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:45.760]   them, God's people, Christ's people, out of God's hand. It's a strong, it's all-mighty.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:56.200]   And let men, and let the devil and hell do what they will. It's impossible. Then says this same
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.760]   apostle in writing to the Romans, he's persuaded, he's absolutely certain, there's no doubt about
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:08.680]   it, that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:15.560]   nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:21.640]   from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. They'll try, they'll do their utmost,
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.160]   and there will be times when we in our folly begin to think that it's happened, that we have
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:32.800]   been separated, that we're cut off. No way of release and no way of escape, it'll never happen.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:41.040]   Nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Why?
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.160]   Well, for this reason, that if anything could separate us, God would be defeated again. The
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:52.320]   devil would be triumphant, and it cannot happen, my friends. To believe in the possibility of
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:59.200]   falling from grace is to believe in the possible defeat of God by the devil, and it's unthinkable
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:07.960]   and utterly impossible. The final perseverance of the saints is of necessity true in view of
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:15.920]   the glory and the character and the honor of God himself. Well, here it is, this is the assurance,
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.360]   "Oh, but you see, this leads to danger, doesn't it? People will say, 'I can do what I like,' and
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.480]   it doesn't matter. No, no, the more you realize this great truth, the more careful you'll be.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:31.960]   This is the truth that makes people keep to the narrow path, the realization of the honor of God
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.480]   involved, and that I'm not fighting my own battle, that when I tend to fail, God himself is involved
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.960]   in it. So there's no danger of antinomianism when you truly understand the doctrine. It's
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:47.800]   the scriptural doctrine. Well, all this means in practice, of course, that he cares for us,
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:57.720]   and that his care for us is greater than we'll ever realize in this world. Oh, the scriptures
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:04.360]   are full of this. Our Lord was constantly teaching it. He says that God cares for the sparrows.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:11.920]   "Now not two sparrows sowed for a fathom, yet not one of them shall fall to the ground without
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:21.000]   your Father." Oh, how much greater is his concern for you, if God so clothed the lily, if God is
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.680]   so concerned about the birds of the air. How much more? There's no need to go any further. How much
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:34.400]   more? Of course. He's brought us into it. He's concerned about us. He's interested in us. The
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:40.320]   very hairs of our head are all numbered. That shows his care. He's looking down upon it all.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:46.840]   It's he who's really doing it all, and we must never lose sight of this. And so, you see, this
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:52.240]   same apostle is able to say in the next epistle, which is in the New Testament, the epistle to the
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.720]   Philippians, in the first chapter, in the sixth verse, he puts it like this. He says, "Being
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:05.160]   confident of this very thing." Now, don't forget the context of that. Here was the apostle in prison.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:12.600]   He goes on to say that he doesn't know how much longer he's going to live. He's in the hands of
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.520]   that capricious man Nero, who may suddenly decide on a whim to put him to death. He doesn't know.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.640]   He may be killed at any moment. And he knows that there were troubles in the churches, trouble in
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.200]   the church at Philippi. Yet he says, "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:39.160]   begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ." Old, ill, in prison,
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:45.960]   on the verge of death, leaving everything. Is he troubled? Not at all. He's confident. Why? Well,
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:52.720]   because he which hath begun the good work in you, that's God. He will perform it. He'll go on with
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:23:01.040]   it until the end, the consummation, the day of Jesus Christ. But this is a truth that is not
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.760]   confined to the apostle Paul. Listen to the apostle Peter saying exactly the same thing in
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.840]   his first epistle, in the first chapter in verse 5, referring to the Christians, he said, "Who are
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:21.160]   kept, kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed at the last time."
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:29.280]   Now, what could be stronger? We are kept by the power of God. Be strong in the Lord and in the
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.520]   power of his might. Right, that's the power that's keeping us. Kept by the power of God through
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:41.040]   faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed at the last time. And then just one other word,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:49.240]   which I always feel we so sadly neglect as Christian people. The ministry of the angels.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:59.800]   Again, go back to Hebrews, Hebrews 1, 14. He says, "What are these angels?" Christ is greater than
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:05.840]   the angels, but what are the angels? His answer is, "Are they not all ministering spirits,
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:15.800]   sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" That's Christian people.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:23.760]   We are the heirs of salvation. And the teaching is that God uses these mighty angels whom he's
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:30.720]   created in order that they might minister unto us. And they do minister unto us. We are ignorant of
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.040]   this, we forget it, but thank God that doesn't make any difference. He's appointed them to their
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.400]   tasks and they perform it, they do his will. They're ministering spirits. And their work is
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:47.360]   to minister to us because we are the heirs of salvation. You see, our position is this. We
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:53.640]   are comparable to the children of some great squire, some great lord. And he's got a great
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:59.560]   estate, but he's got a son and heir, who one day is going to inherit all that. But he's now a babe,
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:05.320]   and he's a boy. Well, what does this great man do? Well, he has servants who look after this child.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:11.680]   He pays them to do so, tells them what to do, to protect them from harm, to prevent their doing
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.240]   things that would damage them, to instruct them and to guide them. Ministering spirits, ministering
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:23.600]   to these heirs of salvation. And that is what the angels do. They're around and about us,
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:32.320]   though we don't see them. Now, how foolish it is of us to neglect this teaching that is given to
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.920]   us in the Scriptures. "In heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father, which is in
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:43.760]   heaven," says our Lord himself about little children. It's exactly the same teaching. That's
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.160]   why we're in trouble, you see, and that's why we become despondent, that's why the devil defeats
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:57.360]   us, because we forget these things that we are being ministered unto by these angelic powers,
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:04.040]   these good angels created by God, largely for this purpose. However, let's go on.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:11.800]   Now, there are some of the ways in which I say we must realize that this Almighty Power is working
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:20.760]   for us. Now, this is all so far, you see, outside us, round and about us, the angel in camping,
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:26.880]   the angels ministering, God exercising this care and this power for us. Now, it's all there,
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:32.360]   it's a part of this. We must realize this is how to be strong, to know always that that is
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:37.240]   happening and that it's taking place. Confidence in the captain of your salvation, confidence in
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:42.720]   the one who has initiated the whole campaign and whose honor is involved in it all. But we can go
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:52.600]   even further. This power is also working in us, not only around and about us, but in us,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:27:01.760]   and this makes it still more wonderful. Now, this aspect of the matter has already been given a good
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:07.440]   deal of attention by the Apostle, and we've taken occasion to emphasize that as we've been going
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:14.280]   along. But it can never be repeated too frequently. There are some of the most glorious things in the
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:19.640]   whole of Scripture said to us at this point, and with respect to this matter, let's look at it like
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:29.840]   this. To start with, you and I would never have been in the Christian life at all were it not
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:38.280]   that this power of God had begun to work in us. That's the beginning of chapter 2, isn't it? "You
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:50.040]   hath he quickened, who were dead, dead in trespasses and sins." And in order to impress
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:56.160]   it upon them, he repeats it again, you see, in verse 5, "Even when we were dead in sins,
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:03.080]   hath quickened us together with Christ by grace, you see." Now, here is the origin of it all,
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:10.920]   isn't it? Nobody ever becomes a Christian except as the result of the working of the
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:23.040]   almighty power of God within him. No man as he is can decide to accept Christ. He's dead. He's
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.800]   not only dead, as the Apostle has reminded us in chapter 4, there's something even worse. It's
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:35.160]   this. Verse 17 and 18, "This I say and therefore I'm testifying the Lord that he henceforth walk
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.960]   not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened,
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:45.760]   being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:52.920]   of their hearts." That's men by nature. And he can do nothing. He's utterly helpless. He's dead,
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:29:01.800]   spiritually dead. What makes us Christians? Oh, he hath quickened us. He's done it by his power.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:08.840]   It's the power of the Spirit. This is exactly what brings us into salvation, that the Spirit
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.760]   of God begins to work in us and to act upon us, to convict us of sin, to open our eyes. He does
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:20.560]   it all by grace he has saved. It's the power of God unto salvation. And there'd be no hope for
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:27.280]   anybody but for this. It starts, you see, in that way by the power of God working in us and bringing
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:34.120]   us to a knowledge of salvation. Now that's the beginning. But it doesn't merely start, it goes
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:42.760]   on. And this I say is the ultimate comfort and consolation. Listen to the way the Apostle puts
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:48.320]   it in the first chapter now. You see, he states his great truth in chapter 1, then as is so often
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:54.720]   his habit, he goes back again to something before that and brings it up. And then he'll go on where
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.440]   he left off. That's exactly, you remember we've seen that chapter 2 in many ways was a kind of
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.840]   digression to elaborate a point that he hinted at in the first chapter. That's his characteristic
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.760]   method. But come back to chapter 1. Here he is. He's writing to these Ephesians and he thanks
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.480]   God for them. But he says he's praying for them. What's he praying for? Well, that the God of our
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:19.520]   Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:25.360]   the knowledge of you. It's all there, you see, in chapter 1. This is but an elaboration of it. The
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:31.720]   eyes of your understanding being enlightened. What for? Well, that you may know what is the
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:37.960]   hope of his calling, what his ultimate purpose is for you, what the riches of the glory of his
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:44.200]   inheritance in the saints. Look ahead, he says, look forward. See what his inheritance in the
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:54.520]   saints is, as well as your inheritance. But listen, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:31:03.600]   to us that believe? Here it is. He says, you know, I'm praying that you may have understanding that
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:12.720]   you may know the exceeding greatness of this power of God that is working in us who believe,
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:21.280]   to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power. You see, he brings out his
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.880]   adjectives. He piles one superlative upon another. Why? Well, because there is no limit, as we've
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:31.480]   seen, to the power and the might of God. But he says, what I'm praying for is this, that you may
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.960]   know that all this great power is working toward you. It's working in you, it's working for your
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:42.760]   good, if only you realize that, he says. And it's the thing we need to pray for ourselves. We need
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.840]   this enlightenment, we need this understanding. My dear friends, if you only knew that God's
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:53.440]   purpose was to respect you, and he's working in you to bring this to pass, that's his ultimate
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.800]   objective. But let's go on and see how the apostle comes back to it again. Look at it in chapter 3.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:06.920]   Here he is once more praying for them. Look at verse 14. Well, 13 is even an introduction.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:13.360]   "Wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:20.400]   You see, these Ephesians, like so many other early Christians, were in grave danger of
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.360]   depending upon the apostle Paul. He'd preached the gospel to them, they'd been converted under
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.520]   his ministry. Now he's in prison, and he's ill, and he's becoming old. And they say,
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.880]   "What shall we do if Paul goes? We are finished. Who shall we write to? From whom shall we get
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:39.480]   advice and help? If Paul goes, well, we are done for." They were all feeling that, but he says,
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.440]   "Look here, I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. For
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:50.320]   this cause, I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:56.600]   heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory." What?
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:07.040]   Well, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man. The power of the Spirit within,
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:13.360]   in the inner man. The exceeding greatness of his power to us that believe. That's it. It works in
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:18.960]   the inner man, and it strengthens that inner man. "You needn't faint, says Paul. Doesn't matter what
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:24.360]   happens to me. It goes on, because it's his power, not mine. I'm but a little instrument,
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.520]   just a little servant, running here and there to give a little message along the trenches. But
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.440]   when I've gone, he'll go on. He's got others. He'll bring other men. Go on. It's his power. You
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.080]   need it, and you've got it in the inner man. And I'm praying that you may have more and more."
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:45.680]   But then you see, he comes back to it again. In verse 20, "Know unto him," he says, "and all. If
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:51.000]   you are not thrilled and moved by these words, my friend, I almost despair of you." What a life we
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.240]   are in. What a glorious gospel. Listen. "Now unto him that is able to do, exceeding abundantly above
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:04.480]   all that we can ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us." It's working in us.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:11.600]   And it's a power which is measured in these terms. It is exceeding abundantly. Now work out those
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.840]   words for yourselves. It means this, you see, he's come to the end of language. He was fond
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.520]   of superlatives. You have to be when you're talking about God. Nothing but superlatives
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:26.400]   are adequate, but they are inadequate. So you pile a superlative upon superlative, but what's it
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:32.280]   matter? It's still inadequate. It's all entirely above all that we can ask or think. Imagination
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:39.080]   even fails. Everything fails. It's all together above it all, according to the power that worketh
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:47.360]   in us. It's not only working round and about you. It's working in you. This is all in the believer,
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:53.760]   according to the power that worketh in us. Well now, there it is, but let me give you some more,
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:00.160]   in order that we may never fall into a fainting, hopeless condition ever again. You've got to
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.760]   remember these things. I've already quoted, I believe, the Philippians 2, but let me come back
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:13.640]   to it. 12 and 13. Here it is, the same thing. "Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed,
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:19.320]   not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence." It doesn't matter whether he's there
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:27.480]   or not. They thought it did. It doesn't. "Much more now in my absence. Work out your own salvation
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:34.120]   with fear and trembling." I'm going to emphasize that later. What I want now is this. "For because
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:43.680]   it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do." He's working in you, both to will and to
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:51.600]   do, of his good pleasure. He works in us. This power is working in us. This is the power, you
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.360]   see, that suddenly when you're doing something quite different, turns your mind to the Lord.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:02.880]   This is the power that works in us and makes us desire to pray. You don't understand it. What made
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.280]   that? What made me feel that suddenly you say, "Well, you don't know, but the answer is the Spirit.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.880]   It's the power that worketh in you." It's there the whole time. Thank God it is. How wayward we
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:18.480]   would be but for this. He brings us back, reminds us, calls us to the Word, calls us to prayer,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:26.160]   calls us to a service, calls us to some duty. It is God that worketh in you. This energy, this
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:31.920]   power, the great exceeding greatness of his power to us were that believe. It's just a manifestation
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.880]   of it. Let me give you another one which I always find is particularly wonderful. Colossians 1,
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:46.280]   29. Here is the apostle now describing himself as a preacher. "Whereunto he says, 'I also labor,
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:55.880]   striving according to his working.'" The apostle is striving, yes, but he's striving according to
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.840]   his working. You see, he does strive. I'm going to deal with this balance later on because so
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.360]   many go wrong there, but I'm emphasizing his power this morning. "Whereunto I also labor,
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:13.760]   striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily," says the apostle.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:19.400]   Now that's the thing, you see. What was he doing? "Well, whom we preach, warning every man and
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:23.960]   teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:33.120]   Whereunto to this end I also labor, striving according to his working, which worketh in
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:39.040]   me mightily." He was aware of it, you see. He was aware of the power working within him.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:45.880]   And there is no higher or more glorious experience than that. You feel you're just looking on,
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:51.600]   it isn't you, you're being used. It's he who's doing it and you are a spectator almost. This
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.800]   is the language, you see, that the apostle always uses in writing to the Thessalonians in his first
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.560]   epistle. In the first chapter, verse 5, he says, "Our gospel came not unto you in word only,
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:07.520]   but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and with much assurance." He knew it. He was conscious
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.200]   that the Spirit was working mightily and overwhelmingly in him. And here it is, he says,
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:21.560]   "I strive, working according to his working, which worketh in me mightily." And this, my dear friend,
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:28.840]   is the power that is in us, that is working in us, and working in us mightily.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:35.400]   Let's not leave out John this morning. John's got the same teaching. Go to his first epistle,
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:44.520]   to chapter 4, and to verses 5 and 6, or even start in 4. "Ye are of God little children,
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:53.800]   and have overcome them, the antichrists." Why? Well, because "greater is he that is in you,
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:39:01.320]   than he that is in the world." They are of the world. "Therefore speak ye of the world,
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:07.760]   and the world heareth them." We are of God. "He that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.120]   God heareth us not. Hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error." But there it is.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:18.640]   "Ye are of God little children, and have overcome them." Why? Well, because "greater is he who is
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:26.680]   not only round and about you, and working for you; greater is he that is in you, than he that is in
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:35.280]   the world." And then go to the last chapter of that first epistle of John, chapter 5, and there
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:43.720]   you've got the same thing again in verses 18 and 19. "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:49.880]   not." That means he doesn't go on, he doesn't habitually commit sin. "But he that is begotten
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:56.800]   of God keepeth himself," which the authorities tend to agree means that he's kept by him. "And
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:05.200]   that wicked one toucheth him not." As I've pointed out in expounding this before, he can shout at you
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:10.080]   he can make you tremble but he can't touch you. "We know that we are of God, and the whole world
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:16.560]   lieth in the wicked one, in his embrace and in his clutches." We are not there, we've been taken out
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.680]   of that. We are of God, and that's why he can't touch us. He can molest us and try to frighten us,
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.880]   he'll never get us back into that embrace again, it's impossible. We are of God, we are in the arms
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:33.280]   of Jesus, if you like. We are in the arms of God, the everlasting arms are underneath and round and
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:40.880]   about us. We are of God, and that evil one will never touch us. He cannot do it. We've been taken
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:47.120]   out of it, we've been translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:55.080]   Very well, then, here it is, but look at it in this way for me to close. This power, I say,
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:01.040]   works in us. There are glorious statements of the doctrine, but then it's put in another way. The
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:07.360]   whole doctrine of the Church involves this and implies this. What is the Church? Well, we've
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.560]   already been through it. Let me just remind you. Look at it again, he starts off, he gives a hint
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:17.520]   of it in chapter one. He talks about this power that worketh in us. What power is it? Well, it's
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:22.400]   the power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:28.440]   right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion and
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.800]   every name that is named not only in this world but also in the world to come. Listen, "and hath
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:43.120]   put all things under his feet and gave him the same one to be head over all things to the Church,"
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:50.560]   that's where we come in, "which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all." Now,
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:55.960]   the Church is the body of Christ and the head of the body is Christ himself. But now, let's go to
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:03.920]   the elaboration of that in chapter four, especially in verses 15 and 16. "But speaking the truth in
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:13.360]   love, may grow up unto him in all things which is the head, even Christ, from whom the head,
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:20.840]   Christ, remember, the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:27.240]   joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, make an increase of
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:34.520]   the body unto the edifying of itself in love." Which, we remember, means this, that he is the
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:42.200]   head and we are parts, individual parts and portions of the body. Yes, but every single
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:48.320]   part and portion of the body derives its strength and its nutriment from the head. I'm not an
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:54.560]   isolated unit. I'm not just mechanically attached. The blood that passes his head comes through my
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:43:01.280]   little finger, which I am, and all the nervous energy and the power, all the power here comes
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.960]   from the head. We are intimately related through these joints and ligaments and these means of
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.280]   communication. It's a great figure about the body. And what he's saying is, you see, that the power
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.720]   that is in the head is working in all the members of the body. The Church is the body of Christ.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:22.360]   It's all implicit in that doctrine. The energy in us is his energy. This is the power that worketh
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:29.080]   in us mightily. And then work it out in terms of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. That is why,
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:34.440]   you see, in chapter 5, verse 18, he said this to us. He said, "Be not drunk with wine wherein is
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:41.080]   excess, but be filled with the Spirit and all the power of the blessed Holy Spirit himself." And
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:48.280]   then we have his companionship, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, the fellowship,
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:55.720]   the communion, the Spirit is in us. "He shall be in you," says Christ in John 14, "to the disciples
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:00.240]   who become disconsolate because of his departure. I'll send you another comforter. He'll not only
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:05.600]   be with you, he'll be in you, and he is, he's with us." The companionship, the fellowship of
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:13.840]   the Holy Spirit working as a power within us. And even as he says in Romans 8, 25, 26, and 27,
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:21.360]   "He even maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." When we are so hard
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:27.600]   pressed that we know not what to pray for as we ought, the Spirit himself maketh intercession
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:35.880]   for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, stimulating the prayer, causing us to ejaculate
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:41.680]   some petition, not always understanding what we are saying, but it's he who's doing it and working
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:48.520]   in us. Well, there it is. This power, my dear friends, is not only round and about us, and not
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:57.360]   only caring for us and planning for us, he's in us. The exceeding greatness of his power to us
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:04.640]   were that belief. Ah, yes, you're wrestling against not flesh and blood, but against
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:10.320]   principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:15.200]   wickedness in high places. You're fighting and having to stand against the devil, all right.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:23.000]   Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Remember the energy and the power that
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:32.160]   is working in you, and it's invincible because it is his. And let the devil and all his powers
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:42.800]   come. You can stand in his great might with all his strength entailed. Stand, therefore,
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:58.840]   in his might. Amen. The closing hymn is hymn number 485, 485. A safe stronghold,
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:04.360]   our God is still, a trusty shield and weapon, 485.
