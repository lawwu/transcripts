[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Podcast listener Molly writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, when I put money in
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.440]   the offertory plate at church, am I giving money to my church or am I giving
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.200]   money to God?" It's obvious in one sense that a gift is going to the church.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:30.960]   That's the name on the check. And so it's not bad. I don't think it's unbiblical or
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.760]   wrong to think that way. I am writing a check to the church. I am giving a gift
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.840]   to the ministry of the church. I want the gospel to advance through the church. I
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.200]   want the staff to be paid in the church. I want the children be cared for in the
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.480]   church. I want heat on a winter morning in Minnesota in the church. It is to the
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.560]   church in that sense. And the Old Testament spoke of gifts to maintain the
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.840]   tabernacle, and the New Testament is clear that giving to provide for those
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.560]   who lead the church is what God wants us to do. The workman is worthy of his wage.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.960]   Don't muzzle an ox when he's treading out the grain, and the grain is the gift
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.080]   of the people who care for that preacher ox, so it's not a bad thing. To think on
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.200]   the horizontal level here of money flowing to people and to ministry and to
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.400]   Christian institutions like the church, I think that's a right and biblical way to
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:43.960]   think. And these gifts are also gifts to God in the very same act, if your heart
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.640]   is right. The Bible speaks many times and speaks approvingly of God's people
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.360]   giving God gifts. For example, Numbers 1521, "Some of the first of your dough you
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.800]   shall give"—that's d-o-u-g-h. That just occurred to me, we have that modern word
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.080]   "dough" as part of your meal offering—"some of you shall give to the Lord as a
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.440]   contribution throughout your generation." So the Bible talks about "give God gifts."
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.040]   And in the New Testament, interesting, Paul says to the Philippians in chapter
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.000]   4 verse 18, "I have received full payment," so it's the Philippians that sent him
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.240]   money, "I have received full payment and more. I am well supplied, having received
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.440]   from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.960]   acceptable and pleasing to God." So Paul saw the gifts that were sent through the
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.720]   hands of Epaphroditus to Paul to sustain his ministry as sacrifices and gifts and
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.400]   offerings to God himself. But—and this may be the most important thing I say—
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.840]   one of the most important teachings in the Bible, I think, is that in one sense
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.720]   we can't give God anything. And that may be why the question was asked, I'm not
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.880]   sure. We can't give God anything that is not already His, and therefore our giving
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:34.560]   to Him never enriches Him. It never improves Him. It never puts Him in our
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.080]   debt. In fact, God is so completely self-sufficient that even our act of
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.640]   giving—not just the gift, but the act of giving—is God's gift to us, not vice
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.680]   versa. And here are the key passages of warning. The Bible is really
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.560]   concerned that we not get this wrong. Acts 17, 25, "God is not served by human
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all men life and
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.640]   breath and everything." Same thing in Psalm 50. God was really upset with the
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.280]   people's attitude in their sacrifices, because evidently they had the notion
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.040]   they were providing for God's needs. So he says in Psalm 50, verse 9, "I will not
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.920]   accept a bull from your house or goats from your fold, for the every beast of
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.000]   the forest is mine. The cattle on a thousand hills are mine. If I were hungry
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.680]   I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine." And then he tells
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.640]   them how to do it. "Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.080]   your vows to the Most High, and call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.440]   deliver you, and you will glorify me." So here's the glorious point from that text.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.640]   God will never, never be put in a position of a beneficiary of our
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.880]   generosity. He's not a beneficiary of our generosity. He does not need our giving
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:19.360]   because he owns everything already. He aims always to be the benefactor, not the
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.720]   beneficiary, because the benefactor gets the glory. So he says, "Call upon me in the
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.880]   day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you will glorify me." If anybody's
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.800]   dependent in this situation, it is not me, it's you, and I want to work for you, you
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.960]   don't work for me. I give to you, you don't give to me. So here's the
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.240]   fundamental truth from Romans 11 35. "Who has given a gift to him that he should
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.760]   be repaid? Answer, nobody. For from him and through him and to him are all things,
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:59.800]   and here's the result, to him be glory forever and ever." King David, in a great
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.440]   passage in 1 Chronicles, took a collection for the house of God that
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.880]   Solomon his son was going to build, and the most revealing thing about
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.520]   God's sovereignty in this matter is that God already owns everything, and your
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:26.640]   very act of giving is a gift of God. So here's what he says, "Who am I," he's
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.000]   praying now to God, "Who am I, and what is my people that we should be able thus to
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.560]   offer willingly?" In other words, our offering willingly is a gift we don't
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.080]   deserve. You have given that to us. "For all things come from you, and of your own
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:50.280]   have we given you. O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:58.960]   building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own."
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.040]   Every gift we're giving right now, you are giving to us to give to you. "I have
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   seen your people offering freely and joyously to you," and here's the
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.720]   rock-solid foundational ultimate statement about God's sovereignty in
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:24.480]   giving, "O Lord," this is 1 Chronicles 29 18, "O Lord, keep forever such purposes
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:31.280]   and thoughts in the hearts of your people and direct their hearts toward
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:38.240]   you." In other words, not only are all of our gifts a gift from God, but even our
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.600]   purposes and our thoughts and our intentions to give a work of God. So my
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:51.360]   answer is, yes, you're giving to your church, yes, you are giving to God, and oh
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.240]   that we might always know that our gifts are a gift from God and our giving to
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.360]   God is a gift from God so that only God gets the glory.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.720]   Excellent, and a fascinating connection. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.760]   the question, Molly. On this note of giving, see episode number 182 where I
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.440]   asked Pastor John, "Is tithing commanded for Christians?" It's a pretty
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.720]   foundational question to begin with, that's episode number 182. Tomorrow we
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.720]   return and a podcast listener wants to know what it means to take every thought
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.800]   captive to Christ. That's tomorrow. I'm your host Tony Ranke, thanks for
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.600]   listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.260]   you
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.320]   you
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
