[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.560]   Radicals, today I'd like to have a conversation with you on the topic of financial fraud,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:47.600]   lies, hucksters, shysters, manipulation, just some of the injustices that are perpetrated
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.880]   on the average person.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.280]   And I want to hopefully give you some tools and some ideas to protect yourself.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.700]   We're going to talk about this from a wide range of perspectives.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.900]   And my hope is that you will come away from today's show better equipped to defend yourself
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:25.920]   against all of those who would like to swindle you out of some of your hard earned money.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.860]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.660]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.660]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.300]   We're going to tackle this topic head on in a straightforward way.
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.820]   I'm going to try to give you a bunch of examples so that you can see how broad it
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.820]   is.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.380]   I'm not mad at any one particular situation, but I am mad that we're generally not taught
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.380]   how to think critically.
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.820]   I don't think I'm the world's greatest expert at teaching this, but I'll at least
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:58.380]   give you some thoughts that I believe will equip you with some better tools.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.700]   Woke up this morning – and I've been thinking about this topic for the last few days.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.180]   Yesterday's show I wasn't exactly sure what to do the show on.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.460]   I thought about doing a show on financial fraud, but I wasn't quite ready for it.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.460]   So I went ahead and played the interview for you that I played with Jake Tassilis yesterday
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.060]   on yesterday's show.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.260]   I woke up this morning to a tweet from a listener who had sent me over a follow-up story on
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.320]   the man named Dan Price, who is the business owner that Jake Tassilis and I mentioned in
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.820]   yesterday's show, owner of Gravity Payments out in Seattle, Washington, the guy who raised
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:42.860]   all of his employees' rates – the rates of pay up to $70,000 of minimum wage.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.820]   I hadn't followed this story closely and in a moment I'll read some information on
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.380]   it, but I hadn't followed it closely.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.940]   I just said what I said in the interview yesterday that, well, hey, if he wants to do it, that's
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.940]   fine.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.080]   But everyone jumps on this as an argument for why we should massively raise minimum
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.340]   wages across the country.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.940]   This is an argument that's taking place in the US American culture right now.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.060]   Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, is bringing this type of content
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.060]   to the forefront.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.820]   So it's definitely part of today's political debate and political climate.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.140]   I hadn't kept tabs on this, but this listener sent me an article, an extremely damning article
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.980]   from Bloomberg Businessweek about some of the background of what may have actually happened
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.060]   with Mr. Price and some of his actual business affairs.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.740]   In short, there is compelling evidence to indicate that the whole publicity stunt was
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.960]   essentially a way of him trying to work his way out of some potential financial and legal
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.980]   problems that were faced by his actions, by his being served a lawsuit, and the lawsuit
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.260]   was served before his announcements about what he should do.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.660]   I will – I might during the context of the show talk about more details of that or I'll
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.260]   just post links to the stories and you can check it out in the show notes for today.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.260]   But what just made me realize is how important it is not to believe things like news articles,
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.300]   not to even believe things like some books and situations like that.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.340]   I've got a number of things that are coming together that in this – in the context of
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.980]   this topic that are really contributing to my wanting to do it.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.260]   So there was a story this morning of Dan Price and the gravity payments and just this weekend,
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.460]   there is – if any of you are on YouTube, probably you watch YouTube videos.
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.500]   It's likely that sometime in the last few months, you saw some information.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.140]   You saw an ad that was played for you with a dude holding a camera up, doing a selfie,
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.700]   standing in his garage in front of some Lamborghinis.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.060]   The guy's name is Tai Lopez.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.540]   He runs a very large YouTube channel.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.020]   But I was just looking at some of the information that was out there, people digging into some
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.700]   of the stuff that he's putting out with his brand and his organization and uncovering
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.020]   the lies and the misstatements and the lack of actual follow-up facts.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.940]   I was looking at that and I'll cover that in a few minutes with some details.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.060]   I was thinking about the Martin Luther King holiday that was just this last weekend and
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.340]   Martin Luther King, one of the US-American national cultural heroes, but the man had
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.940]   some serious, serious problems which I'll mention a few in a minute.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.660]   Then looking – I'm reading a book by Pamela Yellen called Bank on Yourself, the Bank on
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.540]   Yourself Revolution, reading through the language in it and just stunned that this book was
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.020]   a bestseller just simply with regard to the language in it and some of the just atrocious
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.220]   marketing copy that's written in this thing.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.100]   Watching the political battles of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and just scratching my
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.940]   head and saying, "What on earth is going on?"
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.900]   So we're going to talk about some of those issues.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.260]   My overall encouragement is I want you to not believe anyone based upon their impressions,
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.580]   but I want you to do your own homework on me, on anybody else.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.740]   I want you to do your own homework.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.780]   My hope is to help you become a much more critical thinker.
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.420]   We'll talk about those issues.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.660]   But I'm going to begin with playing for you a media clip here that I think is very
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.020]   important for you to hear.
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.180]   This was something I first became aware of when I was in college.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.660]   In my business law class in college, my favorite class in all of my four years of university
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.860]   education was business law.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.340]   We studied the case of the woman who spilled hot coffee on her lap.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.260]   I came away from that recognizing how little I knew about what actually happens in some
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:47.380]   situations versus what is reported about what happens in some situations.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.020]   This moment in my life was a real turning point and I recommitted myself to trying my
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.500]   best to do my homework on issues.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.060]   I make plenty of mistakes.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.660]   I get stuff wrong all the time.
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.740]   I don't claim any degree of necessary expertise on this, but I do my best to dig a little
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.580]   deeper and try to do homework on things.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.220]   I'm going to play this audio clip for you.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.900]   This would be a good thing if you are listening to me while you're sitting in front of a computer.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.740]   I would recommend to you that you'll enjoy actually if you can separate your attention
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.420]   and watch a video, you will enjoy seeing this in video form so that you can see exactly
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.940]   who's talking, some of the news clippings and things like that that are put on the screen
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.940]   for you.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.580]   If you're driving in the car, don't worry.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.840]   You will certainly be able to grasp the story simply with the audio, but you won't miss
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   a lot.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.500]   But if you are in front of a computer, then this would be a good piece of audio for you
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.980]   to stop and then go ahead and watch the video.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.420]   The video is 12 minutes and 14 seconds long, so feel free if you pause just to skip forward
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.620]   12 minutes if you're going to watch it on a computer.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.540]   Let's start with here, this story, because what you know about this story and what you've
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.280]   heard about the story may be two different things.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:01.380]   This is a report from the Retro Report, which was a project of the New York Times, and this
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.460]   was published back in 2013.
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.140]   So here is the audio from the video.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:14.980]   In Albuquerque, New Mexico, an elderly woman was severely burned when she spilled a cup
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.020]   of McDonald's coffee in her lap.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:23.140]   An 81-year-old woman has been awarded $2.9 million after she sued McDonald's, claiming
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.380]   their coffee was too hot.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.540]   Stella Liebeck spilled just eight ounces of coffee, but she attracted a flood of attention.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.280]   The jury's award set off a media frenzy and became a rallying cry for those who believed
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.380]   our legal system had run amok.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.620]   I think it's absurd.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.020]   But as her story cycled through newspaper headlines, talk show storylines, and late
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.820]   night punchlines, one thing was lost, the facts.
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:09:05.500]   This story is the most widely misunderstood story in America.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.660]   The public perception of it is Stella Liebeck won a lottery.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.700]   She bought the coffee, she spilled it on herself, and now look, she's a millionaire.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.860]   But of course the facts are much more complicated than that.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.740]   Stella Liebeck was a 79-year-old widow sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car when
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.020]   she was burned on February 27, 1992.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.620]   She had recently quit her job as a department store clerk and moved to Albuquerque to be
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.180]   near her daughter.
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:38.580]   The day that the burns happened, my mother and my nephew went through the drive-thru
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.420]   at McDonald's and got breakfast and coffee.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.940]   And they pulled into the parking lot, and in the Ford Probe, there's slanted surfaces
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.940]   everywhere.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.660]   There's no place to put the coffee.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.180]   She put it between her knees and lifted the lid off.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.460]   And in the process of doing that, spilled the coffee and all of the hot liquid went
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:06.260]   into the sweatsuit that she was wearing and pooled in the seat.
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.620]   All I remember is trying to get out of the car.
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.820]   I screamed, not realizing I was burned that bad.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.820]   I knew I was in terrible pain.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.900]   The severity of the burns caused Stella Liebeck to go into shock, and her grandson immediately
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.080]   took her to the emergency room.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.300]   She was burned over 16 percent of her body.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.220]   Six percent of the burns were third degree.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.860]   She was in the hospital for a week.
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.220]   Medical bills were $10,000.
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.420]   So Stella reached out to McDonald's and asked to be reimbursed.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.980]   We couldn't believe that this could happen over spilling the coffee.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:48.380]   So we wrote a letter to McDonald's asking them to check the temperature of the coffee
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.860]   and to give recompense for the medical bills.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:58.100]   And the response from McDonald's was an offer of $800.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:03.760]   Stella Liebeck had never sued anyone before Albuquerque attorney Ken Wagner took her case.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.280]   Before they went to trial, they tried twice to settle out of court.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.580]   But McDonald's refused.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.820]   We bought a product.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.180]   It was used as intended.
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:18.740]   It was unreasonably hot and therefore unreasonably dangerous.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.540]   And those were the essential facts.
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.580]   I was not in it for the money.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.020]   I was in it because I wanted them to bring the temperature down so that other people
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.740]   would not go through the same thing I did.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.940]   McDonald's policy was to serve coffee between 180 and 190 degrees.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.500]   That's about 30 degrees warmer than most home coffee brewing machines.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.980]   A burn expert testified that liquid at 180 degrees could cause third-degree burns within
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.260]   15 seconds.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:55.500]   Lawyers produced documents that showed that between 1983 and 1992, nearly 700 people claimed
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.340]   that they had been burned by hot coffee at McDonald's.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.020]   McDonald's was on big-time notice that they had a product that was dangerous and it was
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.320]   burning people.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.700]   We argued that to the jury, that they were callous and indifferent in simply not turning
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.780]   down the temperature.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:18.420]   An expert for McDonald's testified that burns are exceedingly rare, one for every 24 million
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.420]   cups of coffee served.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:27.680]   They just said it's statistically insignificant and we're not going to change what we do.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.980]   People interact with hot beverages all the time in a fast food restaurant and that doesn't
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:38.500]   necessarily mean that the restaurant is doing something wrong.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.220]   Attorney Tracy Jenks tried the case for McDonald's and argued that Mrs. Liebeck bore personal
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.780]   responsibility because she spilled the coffee on herself and that McDonald's coffee wasn't
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.900]   any hotter than the coffee at other fast food restaurants.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.620]   She said the reason the coffee was so hot was because that's what customers wanted.
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:01.420]   McDonald's had a really, really strong reason for why they brewed their coffee at the temperature
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.640]   they did.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.380]   It was an industrial standard based on the maximum extraction of the flavor and the maximum
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.420]   holding temperature.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.120]   But the jury saw how liquid at that temperature can scald when they were shown graphic photos
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.500]   of Mrs. Liebeck's burned groin.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.780]   The photos depicted where they had to graft the skin from the side of her legs to close
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.500]   the third degree burn.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:31.100]   And I think if people would have seen the severity of the burns, they would have realized
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.860]   it was not a laughing matter.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:39.140]   After seven days of testimony and four hours of deliberation, jurors came up with a comprehensive
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.580]   answer to a complicated case.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:47.080]   They unanimously agreed to award Stella $200,000 in compensatory damages.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.860]   But because she caused the spill, they reduced that to $160,000.
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.080]   Jurors set punitive damages to send the message to McDonald's to turn down the temperature
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.080]   of the coffee.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:02.560]   I remember I could see Judge Scott going like this with his pencil and I thought, "Oh, I
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.000]   hope he's counting digits on the verdict form."
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.540]   And he was.
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:14.820]   They based the amount on the revenue from two days of coffee sales, $2.7 million.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:20.440]   The size of the award got the media's attention, but it overshadowed the rest of the story.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.160]   Details of the case and the facts related to how the jury made its decision went mostly
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   unreported.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:33.880]   Several days after the verdict, I had news crews from France, Japan, Germany in my driveway
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.040]   wanting to interview me.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.560]   I mean, I was stunned.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.720]   After the verdict came in Wednesday, August 17, the Albuquerque Journal ran the first
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.720]   story.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.400]   The Associated Press and Reuters Wire Services then filed reports, and the story was picked
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   up in dozens of newspapers worldwide.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.840]   It became an international news event.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.040]   But as the story's reach got bigger, the word count got smaller.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   In some papers, it was not more than a blurb.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.120]   Six hundred and ninety-seven words in the Albuquerque Journal became 349 words in the
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:13.400]   AP and became as few as 48 words in various renderings by major metropolitan newspapers.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.520]   Forty-eight words can't explain a lot.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:22.360]   And then "woman coffee millions" sounds like a ripoff, not like a logical consequence of
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.200]   a thoughtful trial.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.760]   The report aired on more than a dozen national broadcasts and twice as many local news shows.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.840]   The condensed telling of the story created its own version of the truth.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.380]   Instead of pointing out she spilled the coffee in the passenger seat of a parked car, this
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.040]   was the new narrative.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.240]   It seems she was holding a cup between her legs while driving.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.920]   Clamped it between her legs, drove down the street, spilled it, burned herself, sued McDonald's,
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.600]   and collected.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.280]   Bella has received letters saying stuff like...
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.720]   I was driving down the road.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.080]   I had no business driving down the road with coffee between my legs and all that stuff.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.240]   See, they're just plain ignorant.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.280]   My mother was made the villain in this story.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.280]   It's like bullying.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   It feels like bullying.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.360]   I mean, it's not like the McDonald's person leaned over the car and poured it.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.760]   It was an accident.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.920]   Very much like urban legends, it is a very compelling story.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.800]   Once everybody decides what is true about something and the media has been sort of an
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.800]   echo chamber for it, then how do you deal with the fact that they might be wrong?
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.040]   Now she claims she broke her nose on the sneeze, got it to sizzle, or bending over looking
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.040]   at the chickpeas.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.640]   Oh, my coffee was too hot.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.920]   It's coffee!
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.520]   The lawsuit also got a lot of play on talk radio.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.280]   It was a very hot issue for a long time.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:47.840]   It's probably one of the most sensational, high-profile tort cases of the last 20 years.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.040]   So when tort reform comes up, most people say, "Oh, sure, the McDonald's case."
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.840]   Republican lawmakers crafting the "Contract with America" seized the moment.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:03.320]   They tapped into public outrage over frivolous lawsuits to promote the Common Sense Legal
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.600]   Reform Act.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.560]   Liebeck's case became Exhibit A.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:13.320]   The lady goes through a fast food restaurant, puts coffee in her lap, burns her legs, and
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.120]   sues and gets a big settlement.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.960]   That in and of itself is enough to tell you why we need to have tort reform.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.440]   She spilled hot coffee on her lap while sitting in her car and claimed it was too hot.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.440]   Every day we hear about another outrageous lawsuit.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:34.000]   Stella's portrayal as a scheming wannabe millionaire was based on the jury's award, but that amount
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.700]   was only a suggestion.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.320]   In reality, the judge significantly reduced the punitive damages.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.920]   The judge reduced the award to about $650,000.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:50.720]   According to a source familiar with the case, it was settled for less than $500,000.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.200]   Stella was not allowed to talk to the press.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.400]   But over the last two decades, her lawsuit has become part of the cultural discourse.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.400]   Pardon me.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   Excuse us.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   Oh!
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   Coffee!
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   You got a chance?
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   Do we have a chance?
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you're gonna walk out of there a rich man.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.600]   Stella's daughter says that although over the years some stories have given greater context
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:30.020]   and a new perspective, such as the documentary Hot Coffee, her family is still haunted by
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.400]   a perception that doesn't seem to go away.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.600]   Life's been getting bigger, Jesus getting smaller, spill a cup of coffee, make a million
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.600]   dollars.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.360]   I like Toby Keith, but he did The American Ride.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.280]   Do we have to keep living this over and over and over again?
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.840]   Man, it's hot.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.600]   How hot is it?
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:19:00.280]   So hot I poured McDonald's coffee in my lap to cool off.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.360]   What people believe are the facts of this case, and how deeply held those convictions
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.260]   are, has become useful to attorneys.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:12.440]   The case that became an example of juries being out of control is now used to screen
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.800]   potential jurors.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.440]   It's a wonderful litmus test.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.400]   If you're putting someone on a jury, you really have to know how they feel about this case
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.960]   to know whether they're open to the facts that you're going to present.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.040]   McDonald's has been in the public mind cast as the victim.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:37.600]   That Stella Liebeck needed to defend her reputation is the saddest piece of this whole story to
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   me.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.400]   Stella Liebeck died in 2004 when she was 91.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:51.560]   The emotion that she went through, she just felt like people were coming at her.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.600]   McDonald's representatives didn't return emails or calls, but according to current franchisee
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:11.040]   handbooks, coffee must now be held and served 10 degrees lower.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.840]   So I hope that overview is interesting for you.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.120]   For some of you, maybe that's a reinforcement of information that you were already aware
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120]   of.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.840]   For some of you, maybe it's new information on a new something that you've ever done.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.000]   If you're anything like me, those were allegations that I had made.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.880]   Talked about how ridiculous it is that they have hot coffee and somebody consuming McDonald's
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.560]   and all for millions of dollars.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:42.080]   And yet here are some facts pointing out how ignorant I was and how wrong I was.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:47.000]   And it really stunned me because I started to learn I need to go and check out the other
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.040]   side of some things.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.840]   Two interesting points for those of you who have consumed the audio only.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.800]   First, the pictures that they showed are really, really, really compelling.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.680]   It's just really, really sad to see these very, very serious burns on this elderly lady's
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   legs.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.160]   They're graphic and they are extremely compelling.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:14.240]   The second thing was there was a clip in there from a Republican, I don't know, congressman
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.360]   or senator who was – he was the one who was talking about the need for tort reform.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.160]   This is an example of why we need tort reform.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.320]   That person's voice was represented – it was John Kasich who is currently a Republican
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.920]   candidate for president.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.880]   So if you think it's not relevant, here it is today that there was a representative
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.540]   using that as the case to illustrate why there needs to be tort reform and now he's running
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.160]   for president as a Republican candidate.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.320]   Now leave aside tort reform for another day.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   I don't have a clue.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.040]   I'm not competent enough to discuss that.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.760]   But for me, that story opened my eyes and it opened my eyes and said, "Hey, I got
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.880]   to pay a little bit more attention to what's going on."
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:03.060]   Now that story occurred in 1993 and the fast-moving events of story published in the local daily
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:07.120]   newspaper in Albuquerque picked up by AP and Reuters in the news and then spreads across
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.440]   the world.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.840]   What about today in a day of financial media?
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.520]   And just think over the last year, as I record this, it's January 26, 2016.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:21.400]   Over the last year, think of all of the ridiculous hoaxes perpetuated that you've seen in your
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.040]   social media feeds.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.200]   Whether if I post this, then Facebook Zuckerberg is going to – Mark Zuckerberg is going to
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.820]   give me money because he just is giving away charitable money or some of the hoaxes that
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:39.000]   occurred in the last two weeks with this billion-dollar lottery that was out there, the Powerball
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.320]   or some of the stupid privacy notice things that were going on.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.560]   If I post this as Facebook, Facebook, this is my information.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.920]   It's just absurd.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:56.240]   And yet this stuff spreads so fast, so fast, and we perpetuate it in our ignorance.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.120]   And that's why the Dan Price example was so key.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.720]   The reason I started with McDonald's hot coffee is everyone knows the story but very
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.280]   few people know the facts because even though sometimes in the past it was corrected, most
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.040]   people if you talk about the McDonald's hot coffee case, most people that you talk
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.240]   with are going to say, "Oh, yeah.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.800]   How ridiculous is that?"
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   And they don't know what's actually going on, and that's what happens with these online
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.380]   memes with the way the information moves.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.520]   Everyone says, "Yeah, that's crazy."
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.560]   Dan Price, perfect example.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:33.480]   The furor that came out when he publishes that I'm going to make $70,000 per year,
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.320]   the minimum wage at my company, and here I am, this magnanimous, gracious CEO.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.880]   I've cut my personal compensation from $1.1 or $1.2 million to $70,000, and we're going
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.240]   to have this great idealistic company, and how wonderful this is.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.400]   Well, this gets splashed everywhere.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.720]   He's on the front cover of this magazine, of that magazine, Inc. magazine, invites him
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   to speak, give him the equivalent, check the facts out a little bit, give him $120,000
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:03.160]   of value in kind for him to come and speak at their magazine conference, and he's on
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.160]   the Today Show.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.160]   He's all over the place.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.680]   It inspires and incites this national conversation about minimum wage laws and the importance
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.560]   of having a fair and living wage, and yet you look at it after the fact and as things
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:21.040]   are starting to emerge, I'm not willing to judge the actual facts, but here there's a
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:28.800]   lawsuit that he's been served two weeks prior to this announcement about his egregious personal
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:37.120]   compensation, and obviously the details of the lawsuit at this point are quiet, but the
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.240]   evidence seems compelling that he's lying.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.920]   Now what will be the case?
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:49.080]   I don't know, but you certainly do not see on the Today Show – I have not seen or heard
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.240]   of him being back on the Today Show facing the accounts because in our culture we don't
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.640]   care about what's actually going on.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:02.120]   And so whether it's Dan Price with gravity payments and the $70,000 living wage argument
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.000]   or whether it's – let me give you these other examples just to show how they tied
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   it in.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Martin Luther King.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.880]   Martin Luther King is a national hero in the United States of America.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.200]   I don't know what your opinion is of him or what you think about him, but he is generally
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:24.200]   lauded as a cultural icon, somebody who completely changed and led the civil rights movement
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.680]   in the United States to lead to black and white equality in the culture.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.240]   Now, most of us are pretty familiar with that story.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:40.680]   Most of us are familiar with the famous sit-in by Rosa Parks sitting in on the bus, and most
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.960]   of us know the story.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.640]   Well, what about some more of the facts behind the story?
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.000]   A couple of ones to pique your interest just a little bit.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.400]   I'll begin with just an interesting little background from four paragraphs of an essay.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.680]   This essay is by economist Gary North.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.680]   He says this.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:03.480]   "In the summer of 1960, I read King's book, Stride Toward Freedom, published 1958.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.360]   It was about the 1955 to '56 bus boycott in Montgomery.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.400]   The book persuaded me that it had been a legitimate protest.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.920]   Here was a privately owned bus line that had a monopoly granted to it by the city.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:20.520]   It forced blacks, Negroes in 1960, to sit in the back, yet they paid full fare.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.880]   Worse, they paid, had to get off the bus, walk to the rear exit door, and get on.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.640]   This was deliberate humiliation.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.300]   It was an outrage, but hardly any white person was outraged in 1955.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.440]   What the book did not reveal was that profit-seeking streetcar lines in the South did not originally
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.360]   have this seating policy.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.200]   This began around 1900.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.240]   It was forced on them by the government.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.200]   Typical was North Carolina.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:49.100]   In 1899, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation requiring railroads and
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:53.640]   steamboat companies to "provide separate but equal accommodations for the white and
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.720]   colored races at passenger waiting stations or waiting rooms, and also on all trains and
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.960]   steamboats carrying passengers," with exemption for servants or express trains.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.360]   Streetcar companies followed the railroad precedent.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:10.380]   In 1907, the General Assembly passed similar legislation for street and interurban railways,
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:14.360]   but this time specifically mandated that white passengers sit toward the front of each car
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.840]   and colored passengers sit toward the rear.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.680]   This legislation was expanded in 1939 to provide details of maintaining segregated seating
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   in buses.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.120]   It's also worth noting that the Montgomery bus line soon decided to abandon the segregation
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.920]   policy, but a local judge forced the company to return to the old policy.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.120]   That was when the blacks sued in federal court.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.520]   You can feel free to read the rest of that essay if you want.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:41.320]   It's posted behind a paywall, but I will link to it in the show notes.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.660]   So a little bit of background on the laws.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:47.000]   Most of us don't know much about those laws.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.800]   Even a little bit of background on Rosa Parks, it wasn't an accident.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.360]   It wasn't an accident that somehow she just one day decided to screw up her courage and
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.320]   say, "No, I'm not going to get in the back of the bus."
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:06.480]   It was planned in months by the local NAACP organization.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.640]   It was there and it was a premeditated planned event.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.600]   Evidently, the girl that was originally scheduled to do that found out that she was pregnant
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.800]   on the day that the protest was scheduled.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:25.840]   So that would have been bad PR and so Rosa Parks was recruited for the opportunity and
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.500]   she volunteered to do it.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.440]   Those little details provide a little bit of interesting cultural context to what we
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.500]   read about in our history books.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.320]   But specifically to Martin Luther King, the two aspects that are very rarely talked about
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.940]   was number one, the man was a serial adulterer over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:51.400]   He was a sex addict, very rarely reported on because that's considered to be personal
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   shortcomings.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.940]   But probably even the more egregious example was his plagiarism of many of his published
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.620]   and even spoken works.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.900]   I'll link to an article in the show notes for today if you'd like to read.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:12.620]   But it's definitely an extremely troubling double standard, extremely troubling.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:19.020]   Now I don't usually try to press these issues because there's such a cultural hot button
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:24.420]   and especially Martin Luther King because he is such a polarizing figure and again,
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.420]   widely renowned.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.000]   We have a national holiday after him because of the work that he did.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.780]   So I don't – I'm not an abrasive person.
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:36.860]   I don't post these articles on the day of his – during the – around the celebration.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.840]   I guess if I were a better marketer, I probably should.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.600]   But I usually wait six months after.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.940]   So it's not in the middle of it all and then I post the troubling strategies.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.300]   The point is how much of that stuff do we actually know?
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.020]   Now bring it in a little bit closer to finance.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.940]   I like to use these non-financial examples because that's something we're more common
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.940]   with.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.940]   What about finance?
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:04.500]   Well, with finance, I refer you to the Tai Lopez example of this guy on YouTube.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.680]   He posts a selfie of him and his Lamborghinis in his garage in the Beverly Hills.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.060]   And here, look, I've got all this money.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.060]   I've got all this stuff.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.060]   So therefore, you should listen to me.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.460]   But we don't have any actual objective proof of anything.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.380]   We don't have any history of anything.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.260]   And yet here's the person that is today making huge splashes all across the internet
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.300]   with a massive online business to be able to build wealth.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:30.780]   So my recommendation to you is that you not believe anyone based upon your impressions.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:31.780]   We could go down the list.
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.060]   I'll skip the political topic and give you just a simple example of things like podcasts.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:40.940]   One of the things that I appreciate so much from many of you is those of you who write
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.740]   reviews of the shows on iTunes.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.380]   That's really, really helpful because you know what?
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:51.500]   Some of my competition doesn't wait on individual reviews.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:58.860]   There are a number of online podcasting groups in which if you participate, you can quickly
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.180]   amass hundreds and hundreds of five-star reviews for your shows.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.340]   Well, that helps with the rankings but it manipulates things.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.940]   So when you're looking and trying to figure out something as simple as what I work in
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.780]   every day is what podcasts are doing well and you go based upon the number of views,
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:16.260]   you always have to ask, "Are these paid or are these actual listeners?"
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.100]   It's always a challenge.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.100]   You can't believe people based upon your impressions.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.900]   So I want to give you some tools, just some simple ideas that I hope will be helpful to
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.220]   you when considering financial information.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.260]   Before I do that, sponsor first half hour is Paladin Registry.
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:38.580]   Paladin Registry is my best attempt to solve this problem of reputation and due diligence
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:43.060]   for financial advisors so that I can recommend some advisors who've been vetted at least
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.740]   to a pretty good basic first step.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.020]   Now I'm not confident that Paladin Registry is perfect.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.900]   I'm sure there are some scamsters somehow who slip through.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.980]   I think they're really, really good though and they're at least better than everything
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.540]   else that you can find.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.500]   So if you are in search of a financial advisor, consider starting your search with Paladin
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:02.500]   Registry.
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.300]   The way it works is advisors apply to be a part of the program.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.300]   Paladin checks them out.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.940]   They check their complaints with FINRA.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.340]   They check out their credentials.
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.220]   They check out their business practices.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:15.180]   They take into account their length of service and they carefully vet them.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:20.940]   And only once they pass the vetting process do they actually let them in to the registry.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.780]   And it is the absolute best system that I have seen anybody come up with for vetting
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.780]   financial advisors.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.200]   Personally, I believe everyone needs a good financial advisor.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.780]   If you don't have one, start your interview process at Paladin.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.460]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:41.300]   Put in your information, you'll enter your name, your address or your zip code and your
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.340]   net wealth.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:46.180]   That will help them to make sure that they properly associate you with an advisor.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:51.080]   It is important that you fill in the information accurately so that they can match you up with
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.980]   an advisor who will help you.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.780]   And by the way, thank you to those of you who give me feedback on your experience in
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.460]   meeting with the Paladin advisors.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.940]   Overall, it's been good.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.220]   I had a couple of people say, "Well, the advisor just didn't impress me all that much and then
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.100]   they didn't follow up with me."
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.820]   No problem at all.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.820]   I appreciate having that feedback and that's good to know.
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:14.020]   The use of this referral link is not a commitment to work with this person.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.580]   It's just simply a good place for you to start your interview process.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.660]   So RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:25.660]   Now the challenge that we face with finance and that you face and that I face is that
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:31.080]   majority of our population around us just seems to be totally brainwashed and incapable
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.500]   of critical thought.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.900]   Now is that by design or happenstance?
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.300]   I don't know.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.300]   I don't know.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:43.140]   I lean towards the direction of its design based upon the research that I found but I'm
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.820]   not quite 100% there.
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.300]   And whether it is or not, it really doesn't matter because we can at least see that that
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.300]   is the case.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:55.300]   And so then whether it was, again, happened or whether it was designed in this case, it
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.300]   doesn't really matter that much to what we should do.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.700]   So when you're looking at financial advice and gurus and things like that, here are a
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.780]   couple of tips.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:15.060]   Number one, is the financial guru leading with lifestyle and luxury and flashiness first
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.980]   or are they leading with something else, something with more substance?
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:24.380]   If you find that a guru or a teacher of some kind is trying to lead with their symbols
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:32.620]   of success, flashy cars, fancy watches, lots of jewelry, big houses, things like that,
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:36.700]   my experience has shown that you can pretty much write off the value of what they have
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.700]   to sell.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:43.520]   Now, it's not to say that you can't gain some good ideas from them but you should proceed
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.600]   with caution.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:53.100]   This is probably the most reliable indicator that I can come up with because in my experience,
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:57.740]   I've not – I've had the unique good fortune of being able to connect with a number of
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.860]   people that I know were actually wealthy and I've also had the unique good fortune of
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:06.620]   being able to connect with some people who wanted you to believe they were wealthy but
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:11.980]   weren't actually wealthy and I've been able to see under the hood or beneath the
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:17.140]   clothes to mix our metaphors.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:21.500]   People that are truly wealthy very rarely flaunt their wealth.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.300]   Now you've got to pay – you've got to figure out the difference between somebody
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:31.340]   who is a mega wealthy, mega wealth, who has $300 million and for that person, for them
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:38.420]   to drive $300,000 cars is comparatively similar to you driving a $3,000 car.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.760]   So that type of person isn't trying to flaunt their wealth but when you have a business
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.740]   owner or somebody who's trying to sell you something online talking about their $300,000
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:53.260]   car, there's a good chance and a good possibility that it's really not indicative of their
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.860]   overall wealth.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.800]   The wealthy people of the world generally want to hide it.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.820]   Why would you ever want anyone to know that you are wealthy?
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.900]   Think about it.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.540]   If you're wealthy, you've got to deal with all kinds of people coming to you and asking
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.540]   you for money.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:13.860]   You've got to deal with being one of the 1% that everyone in society is mad at.
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:18.900]   You've got to deal with the risk of people trying to come and get your wealth and if
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.340]   you're actually wealthy, you know that the way that you get wealthy and stay wealthy
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:28.220]   is frugality and thrift and wise investing.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:33.940]   So if you're actually wealthy, what on earth would compel you to advertise your wealth?
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.780]   Well, the only thing that would compel you to advertise your wealth was if you could
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.740]   somehow earn off of that advertisement.
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:45.660]   If you could display that wealth and therefore convey that you have that wealth and then
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.580]   you can earn something.
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:53.580]   People following you as a guru of wealth, attracting an attractive mate to you, showing
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:58.860]   off that you've got some advantage, showing your clients that you're really, really competent,
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.420]   showing that advertising who you are.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.220]   But other than that, if you don't have something to gain for it, why would you want anyone
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.220]   to know that you're wealthy?
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.460]   I'm not saying you wouldn't want to enjoy the fruits of your wealth.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.980]   It's nice to ride in a luxury car.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.180]   It's nice to own a helicopter if you enjoy that kind of thing.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:18.900]   But usually there's a difference between being able to enjoy that and advertising that.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.260]   The people who are really wealthy never display their wealth.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.260]   It's all hidden behind a very large wall around their house.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.740]   If you want a good example, come down to where I live here in West Palm Beach.
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.420]   You can go to Palm Beach Island or drive up to Jupiter Island.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:37.340]   You drive around Jupiter Island, one of the most highest concentrations of wealth in the
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.540]   country.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.540]   Drive around Jupiter Island.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.660]   The roads are public.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:45.900]   You will hardly see a single house because they're all hidden back from the road.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.020]   That's why these islands – I mean you got Jupiter Island and what?
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.340]   Jupiter Island, Jekyll Island and Mount Desert Island.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.260]   This is where the wealthy go to get away and put up walls around themselves.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.860]   The fact that it's an island is really, really useful because people don't accidentally
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.400]   go onto the island.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.400]   But you never see the houses.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:05.380]   I had a unique experience one time when I was – I just graduated from college.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:11.380]   I was invited by a friend to go for dinner at the house of an estate on Palm Beach.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:16.360]   Prior to getting there, I did not know what the circumstances were.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.020]   Now if I had known, I probably – I don't know what I would have done.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.020]   But anyway, I didn't know.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.020]   I just thought that would be fun.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.380]   We're going to go have dinner with some guy.
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.380]   He's dead now.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:28.340]   So I can – I'm not betraying any privacy of anything that matters.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.620]   But the man's name was John Kluge.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.340]   He was formerly the richest man in the world back in the '90s.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:39.400]   So when we got there, they gave me the address and Palm Beach is an interesting place.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.540]   Many of the streets look the same.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.980]   They have walls covered with some sort of vegetation.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.520]   The gardeners are the ones who make a ton of money in Palm Beach, keeping everything
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.520]   looking beautiful.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.740]   We just pulled through this little gate, through this little hole in the wall and all of a
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:56.160]   sudden I realized that we're on this massive multi-multi-acre estate.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.480]   From the outside, you would have never had any idea.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.780]   But the house was huge and the grounds were massive.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.540]   To give you an idea of how big they were, I had known a story from another connection
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.880]   of a man who had owned a house in the back of this guy and we actually worked it out
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.140]   over dinner that night, the connection from this other story.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.780]   The guy told the story about how some rich guy had bought his house just simply to knock
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.040]   it down and put in a garden.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:24.520]   His house was on Palm Beach worth many millions of dollars.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.080]   I don't know whether to say tens or – I would say – yeah, tens probably.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.220]   Many millions of dollars and the guy had bought this house simply to knock the house down
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.300]   so he could have a bigger garden out behind his house.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.240]   Well, the man was John Kluge and this estate was huge.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.740]   But to this day, if I didn't have the address, I could not find it.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.380]   I wouldn't have any idea where to go.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.500]   But when I'm walking around this multi-acre estate in the middle of Palm Beach, all of
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.760]   a sudden it's different and you can see how big it is.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.960]   People who are truly wealthy generally hide that wealth just a little bit and they only
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:00.760]   display it in areas where it's safe, in areas where they're with their peers.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:05.640]   Now I again have had the unique experience of living here in this part of the world and
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:10.480]   I'll give you – I'm friends with a man who was formerly the CEO of one of the world's
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.480]   largest investment banks up in New York City.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.000]   You know what car he drives?
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   A Prius because he doesn't care.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.560]   Now I can't remember if his wife has a Mercedes but he drives a Prius.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.760]   It's easier and better to be underestimated.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:34.440]   Usually I happen to have some – I wind up going to the Everglades Club which is a private
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.480]   club in Palm Beach.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.440]   Once or twice a year I get an invitation from somebody who's a member there.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:45.400]   I always enjoy going because my friends that I've had the pleasure of building relationships
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:51.240]   with, it's just kind of fun to peer into the Palm Beach society.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:57.400]   You would be surprised at how restrained generally the expressions of wealth are even though
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:02.280]   sometimes you're sitting at a table and you know for a fact that everyone around that
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.760]   table is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.440]   Even among the glittering rich, you find that the expressions of wealth are often a little
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.440]   bit subdued.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:16.160]   Now when you get into the mass affluent, you know that they're always subdued.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.200]   Read – again, read Tom Stanley's work, The Millionaire Next Door.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:23.280]   He'll prove it to you again and again and again and again and again.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.600]   You start to see, wait a second, why is this person advertising their wealth?
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.400]   Unless there's a benefit in it for them, there's no reason for a wealthy person to
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   talk about it.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.480]   That should be a big red flag.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.520]   I think on tomorrow's show, I'm going to do a review of John Schaub's seminar.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.360]   You know what I most appreciate about John Schaub?
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.880]   He invited his seminar participants over to his house, had a chance to spend some time
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:55.680]   there, and his house, his cars, everything was understated.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:01.680]   That means a whole lot more to me now than the guy who previously when I was sucked into
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.920]   the world of gurus was talking about this and this flashy Porsche and that flashy giant
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.200]   $300,000 bus, etc.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.760]   So when you see somebody advertising their wealth, you should be very, very suspicious.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.120]   Doesn't mean they don't have it.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.500]   Doesn't mean there's not a reason for it.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.720]   Just be very suspicious and it should immediately put you on guard.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:27.040]   Next, when you see somebody using broad and imprecise language, that should make you suspicious.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.080]   This is my biggest problem, again, reading Bank on Yourself for a comprehensive project
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.240]   I'm working through on this infinite banking concept.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:38.640]   I can hardly get through the first chapter because the language in the book is so broad
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.760]   stroke.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.800]   It gets deeply into an us versus them.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.000]   Wall Street is ripping you off.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.880]   Who is Wall Street?
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880]   Wall Street is a place.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.960]   Yes, I know it's a metaphor for a community, but who specifically?
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.360]   Because there's a big difference between all the different people that are involved in
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.760]   Wall Street.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:01.960]   If somebody gets into an us versus them mentality, usually it's because they're trying to create
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.280]   a cult of personality.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:10.080]   I'm reminded of Robert Greene's work in the book 48 Laws of Power, which is a really twisted
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.080]   book.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.160]   But basically if you want to create and develop for yourself power, here's how to do it.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.880]   It's an interesting book.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:20.680]   But two of his laws are especially poignant to our conversation today.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:26.360]   Law 27, the summary is, "You need to play on people's need to believe to create a cult-like
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.000]   following.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.120]   People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:36.800]   Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.640]   Keep your words vague but full of promise.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.980]   Emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.000]   Give your new disciples rituals to perform.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.280]   Ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.120]   In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.520]   you untold power."
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:58.280]   You see that happening constantly, people's desire to pit certain segments against other
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:03.160]   segments, whether it's in politics, the Republicans versus the Democrats, or the Main Street versus
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.600]   Wall Street, or the 1% versus the 99%.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:12.840]   Whatever the example is, it's all about building that cult of personality.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.640]   Law 32 is useful too with the point that I just made.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.640]   Play to people's fantasies.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.240]   "The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant."
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.840]   So Joshua's instructions here, "The truth about wealth building is it takes time.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.840]   It takes discipline.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.600]   It's hard work."
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.280]   So the truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.800]   Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes for
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.000]   disenchantment.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.360]   Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   fantasy are like oases in the desert.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.720]   Everyone flocks to them.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.960]   There's great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.160]   So when you see people pitting one versus another, and you see people building those
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:00.160]   fantasies, playing on those strings, be careful.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.160]   Be careful.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:05.400]   A couple more and then some tips, but before I get to the last two points to watch out
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.920]   for and the tips for you, sponsor second half hour of the show is SoFi.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:14.680]   SoFi, short for social finance, SoFi is working to revolutionize the world of lending.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.800]   They started with student loans.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.840]   They've expanded to personal loans and mortgage loans.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.300]   They're expanding to new opportunities all the time.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:26.580]   The coolest thing about SoFi is they are actually a modern company with a modern integrated
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:31.960]   electronic system for you to apply for financing, whether that's to apply for student loans
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.000]   or personal loans.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.360]   If you have debt or if you have a need for money for something, check out their financing
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.460]   system and see if you can figure out a way to save money on your debt by refinancing
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.460]   with SoFi.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.640]   If you have student loans, check out their student loan refinancing system.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.280]   You can apply in minutes, find out some information on whether or not you are a good fit for them.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.520]   If you have personal loans, they have those offers as well.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:01.480]   If you use my special referral link, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi, S-O-F-I,
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.660]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.400]   You will get a $200 bonus to your student loans when you refinance.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.800]   And if you refinance a personal loan, you'll get a $100 bonus as well.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.920]   So that hopefully will incentivize you to use my link.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.840]   That helps them to track my performance and I thank you for doing that.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.760]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.880]   Last two.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.400]   Last two points here on just watching out for financial fraud.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.760]   Look for vague allegations without technical precision.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.220]   This to me is a major warning bell.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:37.940]   When you see people make these broad, broad strokes, I talked a moment ago about they,
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:42.660]   they are doing this, Wall Street is doing this, it's a problem.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:50.980]   And when you see these vague allegations without any specific clear allegations, you know you've
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.980]   got a problem, especially if there's no footnotes.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:58.780]   This is just playing on the emotional needs that people have without footnoting things.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:46:59.780]   So look for that.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:03.540]   And if you see those vague and broad allegations, you've got a major problem.
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:08.900]   Finally, the one that just drives me nuts is look for deceptive charts.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:13.220]   As I've been reading this Bank on Yourself book, it is so frustrating.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.780]   I finally found about the eighth chart in the book, I finally found a chart that was
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.520]   well-created.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.940]   If you see a chart with an unlabeled axis, that should be a major red flag.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:27.780]   If you see a chart that doesn't go from zero to whatever the value is that's being displayed,
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.740]   that should be a major red flag for you.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:34.140]   If you see a chart that's showing a selected period of data, that should be a major red
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.180]   flag for you.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.940]   It's not that those types of charts shouldn't be used from time to time.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:42.720]   You can't always display a chart of the entire stock market history when you're trying to
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.420]   look at the stock returns for the last year.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.920]   That's not useful to you.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.880]   You do sometimes need to home in on what is the appropriate period.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.660]   But when you see a chart that's being pooled to support a point and it's got a specific
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:59.420]   date range, the most egregious example in this Bank on Yourself book was the chart that
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:03.740]   was chosen for stock returns, real estate returns, and gold returns.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.500]   Every one of them had a different date range and every one of them was the worst possible
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:16.420]   expression, the worst timing whatsoever instead of being a standardized version to show, "Hey,
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.460]   here's how these things compare."
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:22.480]   You know you've got a deceptive practice if you've got deceptive charts or at least you
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:28.180]   should be suspicious and you should go and recreate the chart yourself and dig into it.
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:29.820]   So just some simple tips for you.
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.020]   Again, this is not a comprehensive list, but just some simple tips.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.260]   I wanted to use these examples so you can start to be aware of them.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.780]   Number one, the internet is your friend.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.140]   When you're doing searches, if you get interested in something, read one side of the story and
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.700]   then try to find the other side of the story.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:49.240]   If you're researching a business opportunity, type in the name of that business opportunity
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:53.500]   and then read the reviews and then type in the name of that business opportunity and
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.380]   add scam to the back end and read what comes up.
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:02.200]   If you don't find any negative information about a company, that should also be a big
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.900]   red flag.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:08.540]   It's very hard to have anything that's going to work for everybody.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.260]   Most companies are going to annoy some people.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:14.340]   Most companies are going to drop the ball and do something poorly with customer service,
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.620]   even take something as simple as a show like mine.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:24.300]   If you were to go and look at a show and you're going to find just everything is five-star
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.700]   reviews, there's no three stars, there's no four stars, and there's no one stars, well,
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:34.500]   that should be a good indication to you that those reviews are probably not accurate.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:39.820]   Now hopefully and thankfully to those of you who love my show and have listened to it,
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:44.620]   for radical personal finance, the majority of the reviews are five-star, but still there
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:50.460]   are a bunch of one-star and three-stars because I rub people the wrong way.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:54.460]   I'm good at angering some people and I screw stuff up.
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:57.660]   I'm not great at everything and that's normal.
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.580]   That's normal experience.
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.120]   There are some people that really love you and there are a lot of people who tolerate
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.400]   you and there are some people who can't stand you.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.760]   So look for a business and read both sides because a good business should be able to
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.100]   stand up to the problems.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.680]   Every business is going to have problems.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.500]   Every business opportunity is going to have problems.
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.460]   Every investment is going to have problems.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.380]   You need to read both sides of every story.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.860]   You should be able to make the positive case for something and the negative case for something.
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:29.620]   One of my goals with my kids is I really hope that my kids are trained in the formal art
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:30.620]   of debate.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.660]   I'm not exactly sure how to do that, but I would like to do that with them.
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:38.380]   I regret – one of my regrets is I didn't spend time in school with formal debate.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:42.140]   I've learned some of the habits and studied a little bit after the fact, but I never got
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.100]   the chance to participate in debate competitions.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:50.060]   But in a debate, you should always be able to make the strongest cases for both sides.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:54.100]   You never win a debate unless you can argue against the strongest case that your opponent
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.300]   has.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:00.060]   So when you're considering an investment option, you should know what the major advantages
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.100]   and the major disadvantages are.
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:05.420]   If you read a book that's just painting the rosy picture and never points out the
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:11.940]   problems of that strategy, you probably have a sales brochure and you don't have an accurate
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.740]   book.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.540]   Look for both sides of the story.
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.420]   Check for social proof.
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.100]   Look for subscriber counts.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.220]   Look for reviews.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.300]   Look for the social media follower counts.
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.500]   Look at the website rankings.
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:29.580]   The first thing you should do generally when you are looking at a website is check its
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:36.980]   ranking on Alexa or compete.com and find out does this website – is it relevant at all?
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:41.340]   Use some of the third-party tools that will help you to know is the person here – how
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:42.700]   big of a difference are they making?
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.780]   Now, remember, many things can be faked.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.340]   I'm sure that Alexa rankings can probably be manipulated.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:52.060]   I don't know how to manipulate those but social media followers, those can be manipulated.
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:55.980]   I can go out and buy thousands of Twitter followers, thousands of Instagram followers,
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:57.660]   thousands of Facebook followers.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.660]   You can buy all that stuff.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.300]   You can buy subscriptions to podcasts.
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.020]   You can buy reviews.
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.680]   You can go out and buy that stuff.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:09.780]   But still, directionally, they're a good indication.
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:14.300]   Look for academic quality and academic level work.
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.760]   Look for the academic citations.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:22.260]   Look for at least some level of careful language when dealing with financial topics.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:28.260]   Now, academic stuff can be faked too but it's – there's a difference between that versus
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.880]   just some of the over-the-top sales stuff that you read online.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.540]   Look for things.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.620]   And then finally, buy and read books, not expensive products.
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:37.620]   Products have their place.
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:41.180]   You're going to be going out with a bunch of products in the future and products should
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.980]   be usually priced more highly.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:47.020]   But if you're not building and buying products after building a foundation with books, you're
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.400]   doing it wrong.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.460]   Start with the stuff that is cheap.
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:53.760]   Books have the highest density of information and the lowest cost.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.260]   Start with books.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.380]   Read books.
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.380]   Then move on.
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.800]   Buy info products.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.800]   Then move on.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:03.020]   Buy seminars, coaching, things like that after the fact.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.740]   And you'll start to build on your knowledge.
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.180]   Do it little by little.
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:12.180]   So I hope that some of these tips are useful to you.
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:17.100]   I don't know if it's possible to create a comprehensive scam-busting curriculum.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.340]   I don't know.
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:22.340]   These are just some tools that have been useful for me.
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.700]   I led with the major ones.
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:30.340]   But I just ask you to build and develop your skills of critical thinking.
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:34.580]   I'm working hard to develop mine all the time, learning to be more careful with my
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:40.900]   logic, learning to smell out the logical fallacies that I commit, learning to be a better researcher.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:48.860]   But guys, we're doomed if more people don't wake up and just pay attention.
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:49.860]   I mean, come on.
[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:54.060]   We're going to wind up with Donald Trump as our president of the United States.
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:59.660]   What on earth is there to say?
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:00.660]   We're doomed.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:06.820]   Anyway, if we're not doomed, I'll stick around and I'll do my best to help us work the way
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:07.820]   through the dooming.
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:14.500]   And we'll be back tomorrow with some optimistic, upbeat personal finance advice.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:18.260]   Oh, politics, politics, politics.
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.020]   Thank you so much for listening to today's show.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.100]   This content has been valuable to me, to you.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.380]   I'd appreciate your supporting the show on Patreon.
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.260]   Become a patron of the show.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:30.620]   Direct supporter, radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron is where you find out all the information
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.620]   on that.
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:35.540]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.820]   Thank you to those of you who support the show there.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:38.820]   It's really, really important.
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:42.740]   You know, I brought advertisers on the show here because there wasn't enough patron dollars
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.860]   for me to continue doing the show the way I wanted to do it.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:51.060]   But still, the patronage gives me a stable foundation of some income, which allows me
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.260]   to be a little bit picky and choosy with the advertisers.
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.520]   And that's really important.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:59.700]   Because if I get in a place where I'm doing all kinds of work and I have, if I have financial
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.020]   pressure to make things work, then I just start accepting anywhere, anyone, it starts
[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:06.780]   to hurt the integrity of my opinions.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:09.220]   So the patron program is really, really important.
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:14.780]   So if you'd like to become a patron and support the show directly, please go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:15.740]   And I'll be back with you soon.
