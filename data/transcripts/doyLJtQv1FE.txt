[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   I'd love for you to tell us about some of the work that you're doing more recently on
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:14.720]   the relationship between sleep and opiate use, withdrawal, relapse and craving, just
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.440]   addiction generally.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.400]   I get a lot of questions about people trying to come off benzodiazepines or people's challenges
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.440]   with benzodiazepine and other types of addiction.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.680]   What is the role of sleep in addiction and recovery from addiction and opiates in particular?
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.800]   This is a very young area.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.840]   And in fact, my laboratory has just started.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.560]   I have a graduate student who's been in my lab for just one year.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.280]   She's done amazing work already, but completely groundbreaking work.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.920]   And what she has discovered already, we don't have the paper out yet, but we're working
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.520]   on it, is that when animals withdraw from opiates, and this has been replicated in other
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.040]   ways with other types of things, our sleep is disturbed.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.560]   Our sleep is terribly disturbed.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.360]   And the amount of sleep disturbance predicts relapse behaviors.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.000]   And you might think, well, of course, you're going to relapse if you can't sleep because
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   opiates calm you down.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.120]   Well, one of the reasons why opiates calm you down is because the locus aureolus, again,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.920]   the blue spot, is covered with opiate receptors that are normally really responsive to our
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.440]   endogenous opiates.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.640]   And so what happens when we are pleased, for example, or laughing, or whatever, our endogenous
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.440]   opiates activate those receptors in the locus aureolus and calm it down.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.640]   And it actually suppresses locus aureolus activity, makes us happy and relaxed.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.560]   One of the reasons why opiates are so addictive is because it also calms us down and makes
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.680]   us relaxed.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.100]   But the problem with exogenous opiates is that they really strongly bind these receptors
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.800]   on our locus aureolus.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.440]   And if you take exogenous opiates again and again, like you're recovering from surgery,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.160]   for example, take these pain medications, is that our locus aureolus struggles to do
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.000]   what it's supposed to do, which is keep us awake and learning and concentrating on things.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So it will down-regulate.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.040]   It will internalize these receptors that are normally only occupied by endogenous opiates.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.480]   And it will do this.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.040]   It will change our genes that are associated with producing these receptors, so you actually
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.920]   have very many fewer receptors.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.640]   So the locus aureolus, at least during wakefulness, can fire and help us to do these things, like
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.920]   learn about our environment.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.080]   And so if you long-term reduce the number of receptors out there, then when you withdraw
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.640]   the exogenous opiates, there is not enough of your endogenous opiates to be able to occupy
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.520]   those few receptors that are there.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.320]   And our locus aureolus has nothing to calm it down anymore, no pacifier.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.440]   And it just fires and fires and fires.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.400]   And that phasic and tonic high activity stresses us out, because it's normally associated with
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   stress.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.240]   And so any exogenous stressor that adds to that and also activates our locus aureolus,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.200]   there's nothing to calm it down again.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.000]   And so it just keeps firing.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.160]   It disturbs our sleep.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:23.920]   And that's why maybe sleep disturbance is an indicator of a hyperactive locus aureolus
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.960]   and such a good predictor of relapsed behaviors, because nobody likes to live in that high
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.680]   stress state.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.740]   And they will do anything to get back to normal.
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:44.520]   So the problem with taking these drugs is that it leaves you excited-- sorry, excited--
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.440]   relaxed and happy.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.880]   But then when you come off of it, you're worse than when you were at baseline.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.680]   You take it again, it only brings you up this far, because you have fewer receptors.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.120]   When you come off it, you're down, even more depressed and anxious.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.360]   And depressed is a word I use loosely, and that's not what I should say.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   Essentially central nervous system depression, I mean sleepier, less motivated, lowered mood.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.240]   I mean, our locus aureolus is actually-- it's the anxiety kind of depression, actually,
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.760]   the anxiety-related depression.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.000]   So yeah.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.840]   So we don't know yet what-- and there's some good research going on right now-- what could
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.680]   restore our own endogenous receptors so that our own endogenous opiates can properly calm
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.680]   our locus aureolus.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.720]   It's that they've been tamped down by exogenous opiates, but that would be really one way
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.640]   that you can access the sleep disturbance.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.360]   So we talked about sleep and the importance of sleep in terms of learning and memory,
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.480]   the importance of the structure of the 90-minute cycle for all of that.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.820]   So you can imagine if your sleep is disturbed by too much locus aureolus activity, the structure
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.280]   and the function of those sleep spindles and that theta during REM sleep, and the lack
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.040]   of norepinephrine, all of those structures, all those functions for learning, something
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.520]   new like a new behavior that doesn't involve the drugs, becomes compromised.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.240]   And so that's something that Tanya Lu goes in collaboration with Pamela Kennedy at UCLA
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.320]   that we're looking at.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.400]   How is learning and memory affected by the sleep disturbance?
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.240]   If there are way we can-- in animals that are coming off of opiates, can we restore
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.280]   their sleep to normal so that then they are less likely to do relapse kinds of behaviors?
