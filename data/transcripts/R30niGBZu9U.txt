[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   We're joined again with our friend Jen Wilkin, wife, mom, Bible teacher, and author of the
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.200]   fabulous book, Women of the Word, How to Study the Bible with Both Our Hearts and Our Minds.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.480]   The book turned four years old this summer, and it's already sold 200,000 print copies
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.120]   alone, an amazing achievement.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.900]   We talked about the book last time, but today I want to talk about your blog, Jen, because
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:33.020]   you caused quite a stir with a 2016 article titled The Instagram Bible.
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.360]   You opened that piece by writing this, "Beware the Instagram Bible, my daughters, those filtered
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.040]   frames, festooned with feathered verses, adorned in all matter of loops and tails, bedeckled
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.760]   with blossoms, saturated with sunsets, cold and curated just for you."
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.800]   Wow.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.000]   What is the Instagram Bible, and what was the warning you were sounding in that piece?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.560]   I've noticed that on certain social media platforms, people have a propensity to cherry
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.760]   pick scriptures more egregiously than elsewhere.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.640]   And so, if you're a woman on Instagram, your feed is, a Christian woman on Instagram, your
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:27.320]   feed is going to be clogged with these hand-lettered verses that are scrolled and embellished.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.280]   And they really are lovely and suitable for framing, but they're often pulled completely
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.480]   out of context.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.400]   I think that they can create the illusion that we are interacting with Scripture in
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.040]   a healthy way.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.740]   But if you think about it, you're only going to hand-letter certain kinds of verses out
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.740]   of the Bible.
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.660]   And the Bible is full of many different genres and covers many different subjects.
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.680]   So for the purpose of the post, I tongue-in-cheek created an Instagram frame quoting about the
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.720]   cutting up of the concubine that you find in the book of Judges.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.800]   And I think I offended every hand-letterer on the internet by doing so, which was not
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   my intent.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.820]   And honestly, I love that people create beautiful art that is celebrating beautiful passages
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.420]   in Scripture.
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.580]   But when we begin to succumb to the illusion that all of the Bible is Instagram worthy
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.620]   and is inspirational, that's a dangerous place to go to.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.460]   The Bible should exhort and convict, not just warm the cockles of our hearts.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.540]   So women, I think in particular, are drawn toward wanting an emotional boost from what
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.380]   they're reading in the moment.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.060]   And I don't know that that's a uniquely feminine problem, but it does seem to color the pages
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.540]   of Instagram.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.300]   And so I wanted to challenge women in particular to think about what they're reading and to
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.300]   read what comes before and what comes after the verse that they're seeing put into a frame
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.300]   out there.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.700]   But it's not really just an issue with social media.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.780]   It's an issue with how we read the Bible in general.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.580]   The Instagram Bible presents a devotional view of the Bible, and exclusively so, almost
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.980]   exclusively so.
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.860]   And the Bible does not lend itself neatly to devotional reading on many of its pages.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.580]   And if all Scripture is God-breathed and profitable, we should be reminding ourselves to spend
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:37.580]   time in all of it versus loving certain verses or certain passages to excess.
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.260]   Such a good word.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.860]   How else has social media changed our private Bible reading?
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.340]   I'm thinking of personal devotional setup where the coffee cup is full.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.900]   It's in a choice mug.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.500]   The coffee's been creamed to the perfect shade of soft brown.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.540]   And the whole setting is staged like a Thomas Kinkade painting with light beams of sunrise
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.580]   inspiration beaming from one corner.
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.220]   The arrangement is perfect.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.660]   What do you say about this staging of the devotional setting?
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.140]   Yeah, I kind of get a kick out of seeing what women will put out there.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.620]   Honestly, a lot of times it's one of my books with a coffee cup next to it.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.340]   So I have mixed feelings about it.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.860]   Because I do think it is worth noting to take Instagram for what it's worth.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.540]   I actually refer to Instagram as the last happy place with social media because it's
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.540]   still a place of optimism.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.820]   But when you see it as a place of realism, that's when you run into trouble.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.420]   And so to understand someone is creating a vignette is different than saying, "Oh my
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.420]   goodness, her life is so perfect."
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.780]   So to see it almost as a lay level art form, that does not offend me.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.140]   But to believe that someone's life is that picture perfect is where the problem comes
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.140]   in.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.700]   And I hear people report frequently that Instagram is a source of woe to them because of the
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.340]   comparison issue.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.500]   They compare their lives to other people's and they feel like their life comes up short.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.900]   And I would say that's to miss the point of Instagram.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.260]   But also obviously be aware of your own weaknesses.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.060]   And if that's an issue for you, then get off Instagram.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.300]   But for those who understand it as, yeah, it is offering sort of an idealized version
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.580]   of our lives.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.980]   And as long as we can acknowledge that, we can take it with a grain of salt and enjoy
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:32.660]   it like we would enjoy other forms of art, but not ask it to be more than it is.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.060]   Well, speaking of things radiant, you have a new book, In His Image, 10 Ways God Calls
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.580]   Us to Reflect His Character.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.300]   In it, you wrote this, "Everything we say or do will either illuminate or obscure the
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.500]   character of God.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.060]   Sanctification is the process of joyfully growing luminous."
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.740]   I love that.
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.740]   Explain that quote for us.
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.660]   What do you mean by that?
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.180]   I think that we don't always consider how our understanding of God will either make
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.020]   us into saints or heretics in the way that we communicate about him.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.620]   And so the reason that I wrote In His Image, and actually its predecessor, None Like Him,
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.700]   was because my common admonition to people when they sit down to read the Bible is to
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.580]   read it as a book about God.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.500]   And that's a very obvious statement to make about the Bible.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   And I have never met a Christian who would disagree that the Bible is a book about God.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.260]   But what I have found is that when it comes to our practice of reading, we often read
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.900]   it as a book about ourselves first.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.100]   And some of that is because we've been told to do so by well-meaning people.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.580]   But the other impetus there is just that we tend to think that the whole world is about
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.340]   us just by default.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.060]   And so when we come to the scriptures, the next obstacle that I found that men and women
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.620]   ran into after recognizing, "Oh, right, I do need to read this as a book about God first,"
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.380]   was that we have an atrophied vocabulary about the things that are true about God.
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.180]   We don't have minds that are trained to look for His attributes when we read.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.420]   So I wanted to write on basically the doctrine of God in a way that was accessible and that
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:23.780]   would help people to recognize how their words or their actions or their thoughts were either
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.940]   pointing people toward Christ or obscuring who Christ was.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.340]   Because the unbeliever is not going to pick up the Bible and read it, not unless there's
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.100]   already some process in place where they're already feeling pulled by the Spirit.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.740]   And so that means that when they wonder what Christianity is about, they're going to look
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.740]   at us.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.480]   Not only that, but for the building up of the body, relationships between other believers,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.620]   we need to be able to look at one another and see the character of God emerging in us
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.600]   through the process of sanctification.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.720]   I wanted to write a book, or actually two books, on sanctification because I am learning
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:08.600]   increasingly that in the communities of believers who call themselves gospel-centered, we often
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.900]   think of the gospel as justification only.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:19.940]   We understand that we have been freed from sin's penalty, but then any conversation about
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.460]   obedience to God can be very quickly labeled as legalism.
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:30.400]   And I believe that the gospel is good news in our justification and in our sanctification,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.320]   and I would say also in our glorification, of course, that sanctification has been a
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.280]   missing piece of the conversation for many of us in the gospel-centered movement, that
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:46.560]   we have perhaps talked less than we should about the beauty of the work of the Spirit
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.900]   in the life of the believer to re-image us and to be the humans that we were created
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.900]   to be.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:59.500]   So, again, obedience and justification are inseparably tied together in our union to
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.500]   Christ.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.500]   That's a good and timely word for the church today, Jen.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.500]   Thank you.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.420]   Jen will be back one more time with us because I want you to explain to us what you mean
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.260]   by the Xanax approach to Bible reading.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.260]   Oh my.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.620]   This is also a trend you've seen crop up in Bible reading, and it's shaped by social media,
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.220]   and I think these patterns are really important to address.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.420]   We'll do that next time.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.500]   On Monday when we return with Jen Wilkin, I'm your host Tony Ranke.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.300]   Have a great weekend.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:24.800]   Bye.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   [END]
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   1. What is the Xanax approach to Bible reading?
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   2. What is the Xanax approach to Bible reading?
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
