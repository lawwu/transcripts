[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.720]   And in this episode, I want to talk about our home insurance policy.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.280]   What is it?
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.640]   What goes into it?
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.940]   What are the various line items?
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.080]   We need to know what we're paying for because the Lahaina Maui fire disaster, that was terrible,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   terrible.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.920]   And it's a wake up call, another wake up call to know that anything can and will happen.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.120]   These fires, they just came out of nowhere.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.880]   It was dry, it was hot, the winds were gusting at 60 plus miles an hour, maybe a spark flew
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.440]   and started the fire.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440]   Who knows?
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.300]   But one day it's paradise, the next day it's a disaster.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.160]   My hope after you listen to this podcast is to call your home insurance company and understand
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.040]   what the heck your policy covers.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.720]   Because it is pretty confusing and I want to go through some of the main points.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.120]   The main points in this episode.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.240]   So you basically have coverage A, which is dwelling, coverage B, which is other structures,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.120]   coverage C, personal property, and coverage D, loss of use.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.600]   Then you've got a policy deductible where you've got to pay out of pocket before the
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.040]   home insurance policy can kick in.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.560]   Then you've got coverage E, which is personal liability.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.460]   And then you have coverage F, medical payments to others.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.700]   And then you have all these other additional coverages in your home insurance policy.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.360]   You may or may not have it.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.200]   Building ordinance or law coverage, extended replacement cost coverage, limited sewer or
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.640]   drain backup coverage, loss assessment coverage, actual cash value, roof endorsement, property
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.820]   held by trust or LLC, and then workers' compensation.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.400]   So the most important coverage is coverage A, which is dwelling.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.940]   Coverage A dictates how much the insurance company pays for rebuilding a home.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.320]   If you haven't updated your home insurance policy recently, I highly recommend doing
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320]   it.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.920]   Building costs have shot up since the pandemic began in 2020.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.160]   Home values have also increased for the past three years, four years actually, for the
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.320]   past since 2012.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.200]   So if you haven't updated your dwelling amount coverage, you need to do so because you don't
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.760]   want to be stuck short in case of a fire or something else bad happening.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.120]   There's also this thing called extensions.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.880]   Could be automatic or you might have to ask for it.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.320]   But in general, the average extension is about 125% of coverage.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.240]   So if you have a million dollars of coverage, well, if something bad happens, total destruction,
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.920]   the coverage amount will go up to 1.25 million.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.560]   And you can ask for additional extension coverage.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   So up to 150,000.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.080]   I just checked with my insurance company.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.000]   But you have to pay a premium for that.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.640]   There may also be what's called a "guaranteed replacement cost extension."
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.680]   And if you got that, well, there's no question or debate about how much to rebuild.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.400]   They'll just guarantee the total cost to rebuild your house.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.880]   But I don't know if there's no debate.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.760]   There seems to always be a debate when it comes to filing a claim with your insurance
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.040]   company.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.280]   Another important thing to know about coverage A dwelling is to be insured for "replacement
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.880]   cost," not actual cash value.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.980]   You can do actual cash value, but the coverage is not as good.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.840]   So replacement cost is replacement cost.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.640]   Whatever it costs to replace your home, that's what the insurance company is going to pay.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.360]   But actual value only pays the depreciated cost of the home.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.140]   Meaning the insurance company will only pay for a, let's say, 20-year-old roof and not
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.700]   the cost of a new roof.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.480]   So that difference could be huge, especially if you have a very old home.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.660]   With the preferable replacement cost policy, the insurance company may depreciate the home
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.360]   for the initial payout, but will pay that actual replacement cost once the item is built
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.400]   or purchased.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.120]   So this difference could be in the thousands or hundreds of thousands.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.240]   Probably not hundreds of thousands, but thousands.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.200]   And it also shows that there are two payouts.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.160]   Initial payout and then once it's done.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.440]   I mean, it could take two years to rebuild your home.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.480]   All right.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.520]   Coverage B, other structures.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.840]   The reason why price point of coverage A is important is because all of the other coverage
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.660]   limits are set by the coverage A limit.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.160]   So for instance, let's say you have coverage B that includes patios, external fireplaces,
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.440]   fences, and an outdoor kitchen.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.900]   Well, the maximum insurance that coverage B will pay for is 10% of your coverage A amount.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.760]   So if you have a million dollars of coverage A amount dwelling coverage, then coverage
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.740]   B is $100,000.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.260]   So look around your home, see what you got, other structures besides your main house to
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.540]   see what you need covered.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.760]   Now let's move on to coverage C, personal property.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.940]   This is coverage amount given for all of the items lost.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.220]   T-shirts, speakers, kitchen appliances, furniture, all that stuff we accumulate over a lifetime.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.660]   Just think about turning your house upside down without a roof and whatever falls outside
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.100]   your house, that is covered under coverage C, personal property.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.580]   Now it is highly recommended, please do this after you listen to this podcast, to walk
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:45.020]   around your entire house with your phone and video record everything in every room in your
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.140]   house.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.560]   At least do that.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.160]   You can take it a step further by itemizing every single item and putting a price and
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.940]   date of purchase and the estimate value into a Google spreadsheet, for example.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:03.280]   But at least record with a video everything around your house because if goodness forbid
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.020]   something happens, a fire or whatnot, you can at least show video evidence of the personal
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.340]   property you own.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.780]   Now let's talk about coverage D, which is loss of use, use of your house and paying
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.220]   for a rental.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.900]   So in the land of fire and mass chaos, owning is sometimes better than renting.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.620]   It seems counterintuitive, but it could be true.
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.180]   One reader who lost his home to a fire talked to many people who were renters who were evicted
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.500]   since the fire.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.740]   The landlords asked their tenants to leave so that either the landlord or one of their
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.580]   friends or family members who lost a home could move in.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.660]   And this puts tenants in a bad situation because now they are stuck in a town with a housing
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.220]   shortage and now higher prices.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.340]   This is something counterintuitive, but maybe it is intuitive.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.740]   If there is mass devastation and a fire, the supply of homes goes down.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.900]   Therefore the price of homes and rents may go up if people want to stay.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.300]   And most people do want to return and want to stay.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:15.120]   And that's what happened in the Tubbs fire in Northern California in 2017, 18, 19, 20.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.180]   So if your house becomes uninhabitable, smoke damage, everything burns down, your home insurance
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:28.060]   policy due to coverage D will cover the cost of you renting a place somewhere else.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.260]   And the standard is 12 months.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.860]   There's an amount you can pay for rent and it's 12 months.
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.860]   Sometimes it goes up to 24 months.
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.720]   It depends on how much that coverage D amount is.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.240]   So double check that.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.180]   You may want to see how much a house of your similar quality rents for in your neighborhood
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.180]   or somewhere close by.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:55.740]   And then use that amount times by 12 to figure out an appropriate coverage D amount.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.900]   Now 12 months might not be enough folks because it could take six months alone to go through
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.020]   the insurance policy to file the claim and agree on a settlement.
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.060]   And then it could take one or two years to build.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.540]   Building times have elongated since the pandemic began in 2020.
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.420]   And so I don't know if 12 months is enough.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:23.020]   I would shoot for 24 months when you call your home insurance company.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.180]   Next up is coverage E, personal liability.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.040]   This is if someone falls on your property and sues you.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.500]   This is something that you should get covered for.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.000]   And then coverage F is medical payments to others.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.340]   This is if I guess they sue you, they have to go to the hospital, or maybe they don't
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.420]   sue you, they go to hospital and you don't have money to pay.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.900]   Well, your home insurance policy will kick in.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.500]   But remember, there is the policy deductible.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:57.500]   Deductible amount could be 500 to 1000 to 1500 and up to 5000 to maybe 10,000.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.620]   Every home insurance company is different.
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:04.460]   So that's why you've got to call and ask what your deductible amount is.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:10.660]   If you're wondering how much a home insurance policy costs, well, it's correlated to the
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.260]   cost of your home, the cost to build your home, the value of your home.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.020]   The higher the price of your home, the more your home insurance policy is going to cost.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.900]   But it doesn't cost that much.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:26.620]   So one example of a reader who said that he had a $1.2 million home, he paid about $1,200,
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.100]   no $1,300 a year with a $1,500 deductible.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.620]   Then I looked online for how much it would cost to insure a $3 million home.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:42.340]   I've seen $1,750 annual premiums with a $10,000 deductible.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.020]   So maybe with a lower deductible, it's closer to 2000.
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.940]   And then I checked how much it would cost to insure a $5 million home.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:56.220]   And that was about $3,000 annual premium and a $5,000 deductible.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:02.140]   So the amounts, it costs money, but it doesn't seem like it's that expensive to get home
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:08.180]   owners insurance coverage, especially if you are living in an area that's prone to flooding,
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.060]   fire, other natural disasters.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.540]   Earthquake insurance is completely separate, folks.
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.900]   So you've got to get a new policy for that.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.060]   But insure your homes.
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.060]   It's worth it.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.380]   And shop around for insurance policies, because if you haven't shopped around for a couple
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.380]   years, you can probably get a better deal.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.900]   The easiest way to do it is through Policy Genius.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:35.300]   You go to financialsamurai.com/pgh, stands for Policy Genius Home, and you can get real
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.580]   quotes all in one place.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.500]   And of course, you should call your existing insurance company to see if you can get a
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.780]   better deal.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.060]   But the likely answer is no.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.580]   They will likely want to raise your premiums because they'll ask you for an update on your
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.780]   home, you know, building costs and all this random stuff.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.700]   And if you want more coverage for extension and so forth.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.900]   So you will likely not get a better deal with your existing home insurance company.
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.700]   You'll likely have to shop around.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.620]   That's why going online is a smart idea.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:12.100]   I just realized I didn't address whether home insurance covers fire.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:18.820]   In California, all home insurance policies cover fire, fire damage, fire smoke, and so
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.060]   forth.
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.820]   But double check anyway.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.180]   I'm not sure what it's like for every single state.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:31.740]   You need to ask your insurance company whether there is "fire exclusion" in your home insurance
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.380]   policy.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:39.700]   So if there's fire exclusion, it means your home insurance policy doesn't cover your home
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.540]   for any fire damages, which is a no-no.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:49.380]   So if that is the case, you've got to get a new policy or you've got to get fire specific
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.100]   fire insurance coverage.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.420]   I'm assuming every single state has different home insurance laws.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:03.060]   So please ask specifically whether there is fire insurance coverage or if there's fire
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.420]   exclusion.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.820]   You don't want to be caught with a surprise that you aren't covered for what you thought
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.300]   you were being covered for.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.300]   Very important.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.220]   And also, for California residents, listeners, it is absolutely true.
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.180]   A lot of large insurance companies are no longer issuing new home insurance policies
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.180]   for homes.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.500]   So if you're buying a home with a mortgage, you might have to shop around.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.500]   You actually have to shop around.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.060]   Now what's the reason for not insuring new homeowners in California, for example?
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.100]   Well, the insurance companies are saying they have concentration risk in California and
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.540]   therefore they're trying to diversify away from California.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.380]   They don't say they're never going to insure new homes in California again or make new
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.460]   policies again.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.700]   They're just saying they need to diversify more and when their book of business is more
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:57.740]   diversified so that they can make money appropriately, because at the end of the day, insurance companies
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.820]   are in it to make money, then they will start renewing policies.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.180]   Start renewing policies, issuing new policies.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.420]   And not all is lost, folks.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:12.220]   If you live in California, you will be able to get another home insurance policy just
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.420]   from a different company that you might not have heard of, which could be dicey.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.420]   I'm not sure.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.060]   Obviously, the larger their insurance company, the bigger the balance sheet, the longer it's
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.100]   been around, the more comfort you will feel that the insurance company will actually pay
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.100]   out.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:33.500]   There are many, many smaller insurance companies that will cover new policies and also the
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.500]   price.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.980]   The price of insurance isn't skyrocketing as far as I can tell in California.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:45.020]   They seem quite reasonable because I checked around and not only could I find a new policy
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.340]   just with a different carrier, but the price is totally reasonable.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.060]   They weren't price gouging me at all.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.740]   So don't worry there.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.700]   Just like how we diversify our investment portfolios, insurance companies are diversifying
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.980]   their exposure across the country.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.980]   And over time, I think a lot of these large folks will come back.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.980]   But do be aware.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.860]   Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.220]   I hope you learned a lot from this podcast episode.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.260]   I spent an hour talking to my insurance company, going through every single coverage amount,
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.820]   trying to understand what it is and whether I have enough coverage and whether the price
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.980]   is reasonable.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.460]   Please do the same.
