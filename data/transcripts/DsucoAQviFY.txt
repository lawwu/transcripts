[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.640]   the first epistle of Peter, the first chapter, verses 20 and 21.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:19.520]   Verses 20 and 21 in the first chapter of the first epistle of Peter.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:28.440]   "Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:37.880]   times for you, who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.280]   him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God."
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.240]   Indeed I want particularly this evening to deal only with the 21st verse, but I read
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:59.960]   the 20th in order that we might include those last two words, "for you, who by him do believe
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.200]   in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.240]   might be in God."
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.360]   Now we come for the tenth and for the last time to consider the message of this great
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.880]   section of Scripture that is to be found here in this first chapter of this first epistle
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.880]   of Peter.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.880]   We've been looking at it because it presents us with such a perfect summary of the content
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.640]   of the gospel and the whole object and purpose of the gospel.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.060]   And we have been looking at it in its various aspects, looking at it step by step and stage
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.980]   by stage.
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.480]   We have seen that it is about this great question of salvation, which is such a marvelous theme,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:59.000]   according to the apostle, that even the angels themselves desire to look into it.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.480]   It is the most astounding thing that has ever been done, or that ever will or can be done.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.200]   The angels who spend their time in the presence of God in glory and have done so from the
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.640]   beginning, are looking on at this with astonishment and wonder.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.000]   And so we have had to spend all this time in looking into it, and even now we are only
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.360]   at the beginning of it, as it were, but we've been expounding the apostle's statements.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.240]   And we have seen how he has told us the way in which God has made this salvation possible,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.880]   and also as to how you and I receive this salvation.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.680]   Well, now, on this last occasion as we look at it, surely nothing is more important for
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.240]   us than this.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:53.200]   We must ask ourselves the question, "Well, what has been the value of all this to us?
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.040]   Do we know anything about this salvation?
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.600]   Do we believe in it?
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.720]   Have we received it?
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.440]   Are we rejoicing in it?"
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.920]   Take that hymn we've just been singing, that great hymn of John Newton.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.120]   Did we really mean that?
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.840]   How sweet the name of Jesus sounds in a believer's ear.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.560]   It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, and drives away his fear.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.680]   Is it true of us?
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.760]   This is not merely something to be considered.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.480]   It is to be considered, of course.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.400]   That's why we started with the text, "Gird up the loins of your mind."
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   But if we end merely at a contemplation, at a mere consideration, it will avail us nothing.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.760]   The look at truth alone is insufficient.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.880]   It is something that must possess us, and we will know whether it has done so or not.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.320]   And therefore it seemed to me that we could do nothing better as we come to look at this
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.640]   passage for the last time than consider some of the tests which we can apply to ourselves,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   which are so plainly and obviously suggested by the Apostle Peter himself when he wrote
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.600]   this very section.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:22.320]   He is writing to people of whom he assumes that they are believers in all this and that
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.560]   they are rejoicing in it.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.400]   He has said so many times over.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.720]   He has said to them at the very beginning, for instance, wherein he is talking about
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.800]   this great salvation, wherein he says, "You greatly rejoice."
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.640]   Though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through many temptations, in
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:52.360]   spite of that he says, "I know that you greatly rejoice in this salvation."
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.800]   They knew where they were, they believed it, and they are rejoicing in it.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.880]   He says something still more remarkable in the eighth verse.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.080]   He is talking about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:10.480]   Then he goes on, "Whom, having not seen, ye laugh; in whom, though now ye see him, not
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:20.400]   yet believing, ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory."
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   And so on.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   Well, very well.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.880]   Here, I say, is the question that arises for us.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:32.440]   Here is the question which we must address to ourselves.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.600]   What is our relationship to all this?
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.560]   How can one tell whether one is a Christian or not?
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   Take it like that.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.760]   That is perhaps the simplest way of all of putting it.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.720]   How may I know whether I am amongst these people that we were talking about last Sunday
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.960]   night, these people whom he calls the brethren?
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.560]   He exhorts these here.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.360]   He says, "Seeing that you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.400]   Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   fervently."
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.720]   Now then, are we amongst them?
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.720]   How may we know?
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.520]   How do we test ourselves?
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.160]   How can we be really sure that we truly are Christians?
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:22.520]   Let us look at the various suggestions which are put before us here by the Apostle Peter.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:32.440]   The first thing he tells us is this, that a Christian is one who believes in God.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.760]   Who by him, he says, do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory,
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:47.280]   that you are in order, that your faith and hope might be in God.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.560]   Very well, here is the first thing that we find to be true about the Christian.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:02.640]   The Christian is one who believes in God, whose faith and hope are with respect to God.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.520]   Now let's examine this first test for a moment.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.200]   It's a very profound test, a very fundamental test.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.280]   It's a very searching test.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:29.240]   Here I say, is the ultimate end and object of all religion, and of Christianity in particular?
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.800]   We are of course never ready to forget that or to fail to realize it.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   What is Christianity?
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.360]   Well, many people seem to think that Christianity is that which gives you a nice and a comfortable
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:48.240]   feeling, makes you feel happy for the time being, some sort of escapism, almost one of
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.880]   the cults which does various things for us and satisfies various needs.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.200]   But that isn't the end and the object of this Christian faith.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   The end and the object of this is, as the Apostle tells us here quite plainly, to bring
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.600]   us to believe in God.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:12.320]   He says the same thing again in the third chapter and in the eighteenth verse.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.660]   For Christ also, he says, "Hath one suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.000]   might bring us to God."
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.800]   That's its object.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.460]   The object of this message, of this faith, is to bring us to God, to bring us to a position
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:36.640]   in which we believe in God and our faith and our hope are in God.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.000]   Well, now then, let's examine ourselves in the light of this.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   What does he mean by this?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.440]   Well, obviously, it doesn't just mean some general sort of belief, because there are
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.160]   large numbers of people in the world who say they believe in God, but obviously it doesn't
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.720]   make any difference to them at all.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.920]   They say, "I've always believed in God," and the very way they say it tells you that it
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.980]   isn't a true belief.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.200]   It isn't the thing that the Apostle is talking about.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   "Oh, of course, I've always believed in God, always brought up to do so, and I've never
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.760]   ceased to do so."
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.000]   But that isn't clearly the thing about which Peter is speaking.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.920]   It isn't some vague, indefinite, uncertain, nebulous acceptance of certain statements
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.960]   or propositions.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.600]   It isn't merely to believe in the being and the very existence of God.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   As James reminds us in his epistle, the devils believe that and tremble.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.280]   So it doesn't mean that.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.280]   A man who doesn't believe in God says the Bible is a fool.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.780]   The fool hath said in his heart, "There is no God."
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:47.080]   Any man who rarely thinks and reasons must surely arrive at a belief in God.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.360]   He's got to explain the universe.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.840]   He's got to explain himself.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.320]   He's got to explain history.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.880]   The philosophers of the Middle Ages were perfectly right.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:05.080]   By means of pure philosophical argumentation, you can arrive at the belief that there must
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:13.120]   be some power at the back of everything, some uncaused cause, some originator, some creator.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.280]   But that isn't what Peter means at all.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.040]   Because you can do all that, I say, and not be a Christian in any sense whatsoever.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:28.360]   Neither does it just mean, therefore, to believe certain things about God.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:35.320]   There is thus possible a kind of theoretical belief in God, some kind of academic belief.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.000]   And we say that God is like this and that, and we believe certain things about him.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.840]   But that isn't the content of this work.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.200]   Who by him he says to believe in God.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.440]   Many of these people have been Jews.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.200]   They've been brought up always to believe in God.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.680]   But now they've got some new kind of belief in God.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.680]   What is it?
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:00.360]   Well, the very word that Peter uses suggests the answer to the question.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.680]   This means an active approach to God.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:12.760]   It includes the whole notion of a committal of oneself to God.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.680]   In other words, according to the Bible, people are divided into these two groups.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.160]   Those who rarely believe in God in this sense, and those who don't.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.160]   Those who don't may include many people who believe in the existence of some God, and
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.280]   believe many things which are quite right about God.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.280]   Ah, yes, but you know, rarely believing in God.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.000]   Well, let's use the obvious illustration.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.280]   Don't we often say about a politician, or a doctor, or somebody like that, you know,
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.760]   we say, "I believe in that man."
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.560]   You don't mean by that that you just believe that he exists.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.000]   You don't merely believe that he's a politician, or that he's a doctor, and that he's got various
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   abilities.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.200]   You say, "No, no, I believe in that man."
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.400]   Or what you're saying, "Well, you mean I trust him.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.160]   I place my confidence in him."
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:05.560]   Well, now that is the very idea that is conveyed by the word which the apostle used.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:12.160]   It is not merely some vague, academic, remote, detached, objective belief.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.800]   I say again, in the words of James, "The devils have got that belief."
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.760]   But it only leads them to tremble and to fear.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:26.120]   There are men who go to hell and are in hell who've always had that sort of belief in God.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.840]   It's amazing to me how people can comfort themselves by that.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.640]   I've heard of men, you've all heard of such men and known such men.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.320]   There are life proclaims that they haven't got this sort of belief in God, but they say,
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.640]   "You know, well, I admit I'm not a perfect saint."
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.200]   And their lives prove that they're not.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.440]   But they say, "You know, I still believe in God.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.880]   I still believe in God.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.680]   I still say my prayers, you know.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.160]   Oh, yes, I still believe in God."
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.440]   My dear friend, that is the greatest delusion conceivable.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.520]   God doesn't ask for that.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.560]   That isn't what the gospel is about.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   It is this.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:12.160]   It is a complete committal of yourself to God.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.160]   It means a belief in Him with the whole of your being in such a way and in such a manner
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:27.000]   that your whole life is based upon this fact, that you really believe in God.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.520]   Nothing less than this.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:36.040]   In other words, we are all, you see, confronted by a choice.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.760]   There are in the last analysis only two kinds of life.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:47.640]   There is the life that is committed to God, and there is the life that isn't.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.320]   And though this man may say that he believes all this about Him and so on, it's not belief
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.320]   in God.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:14:01.640]   Belief in God means committal, that the whole of your life is based upon this fact, this
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640]   belief.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.120]   Now, what does it mean?
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.280]   Let me put it in detail, because this is the most vital matter that we can ever consider
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.160]   together.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.960]   It means this, doesn't it, that our whole outlook is determined by this.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   By what?
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.400]   Well, by the fact of God.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.880]   The fact that God is.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:35.440]   And in other words, by the fact of our relationship, all of us, to God.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:42.760]   It means a life which is governed by this, that we know that God is there in heaven and
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.240]   is looking down upon us, every one of us.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.640]   We know that He is our Maker and Creator, as He is the Creator of everything that is
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.640]   in life and everything that is in the world.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.800]   We are aware that everything we do and think and say is done under the eye of God.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.480]   It is this awareness of God that we are living under God.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.400]   Here's the great watershed which divides men into the two groups.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:15.480]   The vast majority are not living in any consciousness of God, but a Christian is a man to whom the
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:22.320]   first thing that is true is just this, that he knows that he is entirely and altogether
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:30.880]   living under the eye of that all-seeing God.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:37.400]   And therefore, of course, it follows of necessity from that, that this is the dominating factor
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.040]   in the whole of his existence.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:48.960]   He not only believes that God is, he believes the record that God has given concerning himself.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.400]   He believes that God has given the Ten Commandments and the moral law, that He has therein given
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.040]   us an indication of the kind of life that He would have us live.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.720]   He believes this is God's will, and that God made us and not we ourselves, and that we
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.260]   were meant to live therefore not according to our own thoughts and ideas, but according
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.000]   to God's thoughts and ideas.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.920]   He believes in God very well.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.480]   He pays attention to what God has said.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.880]   Not the armchair philosopher, you know, who has an argument about God while he's puffing
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.240]   at his pipe and the other with his cigarette, having a marvelous argument about God.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.480]   "Oh yes, I'm a theist, of course, I believe."
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.880]   Dear me, no.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.680]   He's almost afraid to mention the name of God, like the ancient Jews were.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.040]   They wouldn't utter the very word Jehovah.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.320]   This man believing in God knows that he's under God and that God's looking down upon
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.920]   him and that God has ordered life in a certain way and that it is his business to obey God.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.160]   That's it.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:56.000]   For he knows that God is his judge, that God is over all, and that all life is moving in
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.240]   the direction of God and in the direction of a final judgment.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.360]   You see, to believe in God is to believe what God has said about himself in this book, and
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.640]   that is what he said.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.600]   He has given us the revelation.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.520]   He chose the Jews as a special people through whom he might reveal himself.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.720]   He gave to them what Paul calls the living oracles.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720]   What are the living oracles?
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.520]   They're nothing but declarations by God about himself.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.760]   And the man who believes in God is a man who believes what God has said about himself and
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.280]   about the men and about their relationship.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.320]   Now then, you see, this works out in practice in this way.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:43.840]   To believe in God means that the whole of my life is dominated by that thought.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.880]   And you see what a revolution it makes.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.680]   It governs all my thinking.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:57.160]   I don't care what I think about, this governs my thinking.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:03.360]   For instance, because I'm governed by this in my thinking, I cannot believe that man
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.120]   really has evolved to what he is from the primitive slime and the animal.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   I cannot believe it.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.120]   Why?
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.240]   Well, because I believe in God, and I believe what God has said about himself and about
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.160]   men.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.640]   I mean, I cannot believe that for scientific reasons, but if I hadn't a single scientific
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:25.120]   reason I couldn't believe it because of what God has told me about that and about myself
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.640]   and about all these matters.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.600]   All my thinking is governed by this.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.160]   People come, I read their books, I read their articles, I read about them in the journals,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.840]   and they say, "But you know, the kind of life you're living is a very small life.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.480]   You are a sort of anachronism, they say, in this modern world.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.400]   You don't know what life is.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.080]   You are still the victim of the phobias and the fears and the taboos.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:56.480]   You still believe in the Victorian conception of God as some great lawgiver and as some
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   great tyrant.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.960]   Why, they say, you don't know what life is.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:05.080]   You are bound, you believe in marriage still, you believe in marriage vows.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.760]   You believe in chastity and purity, men, you don't know what living is.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.640]   Why don't you let yourself go?
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.720]   Why don't you let those powers and instincts that are in you have their fling?
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.720]   Why not?"
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.840]   Well, I'll tell you why not at the very beginning.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:24.200]   You see, my thinking is dominated by God, and I can't think like that.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.440]   The philosophy is wrong, before we go any further.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:34.960]   "You believe in God," says Peter, "because you believe in God, you're very unlike the
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.520]   people who don't believe in God.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.240]   You don't think in the same way any longer.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.600]   There is nothing more revolutionary that happens to a man when he becomes a Christian than
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.440]   the way in which he finds himself thinking in a new dimension.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:55.000]   He's got a key to the understanding of enigmas and problems that have baffled him all his
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   life.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.100]   You know, the moment you submit yourself to God and your whole thinking is governed by
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:06.520]   God, it greatly simplifies life.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.880]   This man sees life steadily, sees it whole.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.600]   His thinking is governed.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.200]   But not only his thinking, his planning.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:22.760]   We are all great planners, and we start planning the moment we begin to think in this world.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.920]   What am I going to be?
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.480]   What am I going to do?
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.080]   What am I going to make with my life?
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.080]   My ambitions?
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.960]   What are they?
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:38.160]   You know, a man who believes in God, all his planning, all his thinking, all his ambitions
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:45.320]   are immediately governed and determined by God and by his relationship to God.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.880]   I don't care what detail you may chance to put before me.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:53.360]   I say that belief in God at once makes a difference to it, even into the most intimate aspects
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.520]   of life and of living.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.640]   Do you know, this belief tells you that if you're a Christian you can't marry anybody
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.640]   you like.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:05.520]   Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.600]   You see, it comes down to everything you do.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.600]   What will you do in life?
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.600]   Is it your ambition to get on and to make money and perhaps do a little bit of cheating
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.320]   in order to get there, saying these things don't matter, it's getting on that matters?
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.400]   You can't think like that if you're a Christian.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.880]   You know that everything you do is done under the eye of God.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:30.000]   So as you plan and plot and scheme, the moment you realize that God is there and is looking
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.800]   at you, you have to scrap your plans.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   You can't do it.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.960]   There are certain things you can't do any longer.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.080]   You could do them before, you can't do them now.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:46.880]   Your career, your future, what you're going to make with your life, everything.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.160]   You've got to give an account to God and He is observing, He is watching.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.400]   Oh, you say, well, I'll avoid that alleviate, but if you're a Christian you can't do that.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.600]   God is there and you know that you can't escape from His presence.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.040]   Well, you see, thus it becomes the dominating factor in the whole of your life.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:12.000]   And of course it affects one equally and obviously also in practice and in the way in which one
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   lives.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   That all-seeing eye.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.200]   No, no, the Christian isn't merely afraid.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.280]   There is a kind of fear that is craven and that has torment.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.960]   I'm not talking about that.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.280]   But there is this feeling that God is looking on.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.640]   You know, my friend, whether you're a Christian or not, there are some things you wouldn't
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.480]   do before certain people, aren't there?
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.640]   There are certain things you wouldn't dream of doing them before certain people whom you
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   respect.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.940]   Multiply that by infinity and there is the man who believes in God.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:50.440]   And once he realizes that God is looking on at every moment, every second, there are certain
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.440]   things he can't do them.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.000]   They're impossible.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.460]   Believing in God means, in other words, that the whole of one's life is governed and dominated
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:06.800]   and determined by this realization that we are ever in the presence of God.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.480]   That is the thing that comes first.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.560]   Am I making it plain?
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.080]   That is the first thing that's true of a Christian.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.080]   A Christian is not a man, you know, who as it were carries his religion in a bag, picks
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.040]   it up on Sunday morning, goes to chapel once or twice, then Sunday night comes puts down
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.840]   the bag, ah, the rest of the week he lives like everybody else.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.640]   Such a man is not a Christian.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.200]   That's not believing in God, that's believing in religion.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.720]   And believing in religion and believing in God are poles, are eternities apart.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:51.520]   No, no, to believe in God means that the whole of your life is under God, determined, controlled
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.200]   by Him.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:24:00.880]   And nothing you think or do or say is apart from Him.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.600]   But it doesn't stop at that, you know, the man who believes in God is confident that
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.360]   God will bless him.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:15.240]   He is confident that what God says is true and that there are blessings at the right
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.540]   hand of God that the whole world cannot give him.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.520]   And he is a man, you see, who has banked his all and everything on that.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.320]   Listen to Peter again, who by him do believe in God.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.320]   Why?
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.200]   That your faith and your hope might be in God.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.600]   You see, in the last analysis I can put it like this, it's as simple as this.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.160]   There are two possibilities before every one of us in this life and in this world, and
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.440]   they're diametrically opposed.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.080]   And every one of us has got to take this choice, which of the two am I going to follow?
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.000]   Now here first and foremost is the way of the world and all that it believes and all
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.480]   that it has got to offer.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.440]   And everything in me by nature corresponds to that and agrees with that.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.960]   Have a good time, get on, enjoy yourself.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.880]   Occasionally do a thing, perhaps you'll be drunk, doesn't matter, it's all right.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.880]   On you go.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.680]   You mustn't be tied down by these moral taboos and these sayings of the past.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.640]   There it is, the way of the world.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:20.200]   But then there is this other call, the call of God, the message of the Bible.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.960]   And the two things are incompatible.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.000]   You cannot serve God and mammon.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   You can't mix light and darkness, good and evil.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.200]   You can't get mixed up between God and deal.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.960]   It's an either/or here, you see.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.160]   Your house has got to be on the rock or on the sand.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.760]   You go in either at a narrow way or a broad way, straight gate, wide gate.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.760]   You can't mix these things, my dear friend.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.760]   You either believe in God or else you don't.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:50.480]   You see, believing in God means this, that you say, "I'm leaving that broad way.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.720]   I'm going no longer on that.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.360]   I see that that leads to destruction.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.520]   I'm going to enter in at this straight gate.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.560]   I'm going to begin to walk on this narrow way."
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.160]   You say, "Well, I can see it plainly.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.840]   It's got to be one or the other.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.560]   I am going to risk my everything on God."
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.120]   That your faith and hope might be in God, not in yourself, not in men, not in the world,
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.000]   not in the pleasures of the passing moment, but God.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.920]   So you forsake the world.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.440]   You leave it and you deliberately take up the other.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.440]   You say, "What a gamble."
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.520]   Well, there are some people who say that faith is a great gamble.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.720]   I don't like the expression.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.960]   I don't like the term.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.720]   But I do agree to this extent that it means that you really are banking everything on
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.720]   this.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:46.080]   Your faith and hope might be in God and nowhere else.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:53.440]   So that you see you are confronted sometimes with a position like this.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   That the world will come to you and offer you something very marvelous and very wonderful,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.760]   but you can only accept it at the expense of denying what you know to be true about
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.880]   God and your relationship to Him.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:14.880]   Now the Christian is the man who believes in God, whose faith and hope are in God.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:21.600]   And so he says, "What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world and lose his
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   own soul?"
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.040]   He says, "No, thank you.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   Sorry.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.840]   There was something within me that responded, but I thought I can't.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.800]   I believe in God.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.280]   My faith and my hope are in God.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.600]   I may have to suffer here.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.760]   I may be poor here.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.400]   I may miss many things here.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.080]   I can't get on as other men get on because I'm not prepared to drink and gamble with
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.840]   them and do the other things.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.480]   I've got a prospect of getting on."
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.680]   You know the way of the world, don't you?
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:56.800]   I've had people telling me that they could have made a great success in certain professions
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:03.600]   and in certain callings if only they'd been ready to pay the price.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   I am told that if women want to get on in certain quarters, even as singers and artists,
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:17.640]   it may well be at the expense of selling their chastity.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:22.520]   But the Christian believes in God and says, "No, I can't.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:30.200]   I prefer to be a tenth-rater than a first-rater at that price."
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:36.520]   You see, the hope and the faith of the Christian are not in this world and its glittering prizes
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.480]   and all that it has to offer.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.820]   Believe in God.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.320]   Your faith and hope might be in God.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.360]   You risk, you bank your everything, you say, "I'd sacrifice the whole world rather than
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:57.080]   sacrifice my relationship to God."
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.760]   In other words, one who believes in God is one who realizes, as Peter will put it in
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:08.880]   the next chapter, that we are but strangers and pilgrims in this world, that heaven is
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:16.360]   our home, that we are simply sojourners passing through on the way to the everlasting habitation.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360]   You believe in God.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.480]   Your faith and hope is in God.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:28.120]   May I ask you, is it?
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:33.720]   Do you believe in the living God?
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.480]   Is your hope in God?
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.280]   Do you bank everything on the fact of God and your relationship to Him and that He will
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:48.040]   bless you and that far from suffering or sacrificing, you will receive infinities above all that
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.040]   you've ever forsaken?
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.000]   Well, very well, there it is.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.680]   But let me come to my second point, which is this.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   How does one ever come to such a belief?
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.200]   How can I believe in God in that way?
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.640]   It involves me in these perpetual choices, in these everlasting decisions, in these rejections
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:11.800]   and forsakings, and by casting my bread, as it were, upon the water, and sometimes having
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.380]   nothing to show except my belief.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.800]   How does one ever come to this?
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:26.440]   Peter answers the question, "Who by Him," who believe in God, "had raised Him from the
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:36.120]   dead and gave Him glory, in order that your faith and hope might be with respect to God?"
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.320]   Oh, here is the answer, you see, and this is, after all, of course, the center of the
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.720]   whole matter.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:50.400]   The Christian is one who centers everything in the Lord Jesus Christ, who by Him do believe
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.680]   in God.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.840]   Everything is in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.200]   Peter says that God sent Him into the world for this.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.760]   He was verily foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:11.480]   times for you, who by Him do believe in God, that raised Him up from the dead and gave
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.960]   Him glory, in order that your faith and hope might be in God.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.960]   You see what it means?
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.560]   Somebody may say to me, "But look here, you are asking impossibilities from me this evening.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.320]   I know what the world has got to offer me.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.320]   I know where I stand.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.480]   I know my prospects.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.360]   I know if I only do certain things, I'll get to certain places."
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.080]   All right, and you are suddenly asking me to forsake it all and to believe on this bare
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   word of yours.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.080]   How can I?
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.080]   Can't you give me some assurance?
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.280]   Can't you help me?
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.120]   Thank God I can.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.560]   Listen to how Peter puts it.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:49.360]   What he picks out here, of course, in this particular instance, is first the resurrection,
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:55.600]   who by Him do believe in God, that raised Him up from the dead.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   Why did He do it?
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:02.760]   Well, partly He did it, He said, "For you, that your faith and hope might be in God."
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.480]   This is the great proof of the sonship of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.560]   The Apostle Paul, in writing to the Romans, puts it like this.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:16.000]   "Who was born," he says, "according to the seed of David, after the flesh, but was declared
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.240]   to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness."
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.240]   How?
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.440]   By the resurrection from the dead.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.160]   The resurrection of Jesus Christ is a tremendous proclamation.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.640]   And what does it proclaim?
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:38.480]   It proclaims primarily and most essentially that He is the Son of God.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:44.960]   Here is the first to rise from the dead.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.280]   "Ah, but you say, what about Jairus' daughter?
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.520]   That wasn't a resurrection, that was a resuscitation.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.520]   What about Lazarus?"
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.600]   You say, "Again, not resurrection, resuscitation.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   They died again."
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:05.640]   Here is the one and only who, having died and having been buried, has arisen, having
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.200]   conquered and triumphed over death and the grave.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:15.480]   He is the first to arise, the firstborn amongst many brethren.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.640]   Who raised Him from the dead?
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.880]   In order that your faith and mine might be in God.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.800]   You say, "Can I believe on the bare word of a book like the Bible?"
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   No, no, you needn't.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   There is something more.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   Here is a fact in history.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.840]   Look at the witness and the testimony of these apostles.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.320]   You see, our whole faith is based upon that.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.000]   Here were men who accompanied with Him, saw Him being arrested, saw Him being nailed to
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.600]   the tree, saw Him expiring, saw Him buried, saw the stone being rolled on the face, and
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.960]   were so certain of it that they were utterly disconsolate and miserable and unhappy.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.160]   And there they were gathered together in a room with the door shut because they were
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.920]   afraid of the Jews, suddenly appears before them and speaks to them and says, "Touch
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.920]   me, I'm not a ghost."
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:05.840]   The resurrection.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.320]   You know, it was that resurrection that finally convinced these disciples themselves that
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.120]   He was the Son of God.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.160]   You listen to them talking to one another on the road to Damas.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:19.080]   They said, "We thought that it would be He that would have restored the kingdom to
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   Israel.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.080]   We thought.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.760]   But oh, He's died in weakness.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.760]   They've buried Him.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.280]   He's gone."
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.960]   They didn't believe what He said about Himself.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.240]   He told them that He would be killed, that He'd rise again.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.440]   They didn't believe it.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.640]   They stumbled at the fact of His death.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:42.280]   It was only when they saw Him risen and glorified, they knew that He is the Son of God.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.640]   There would never have been a Christian church were it not for the resurrection.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.080]   It is the best attested fact of history.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.320]   But He not only raised Him from the dead, He gave Him glory.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   What does He mean?
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:35:00.040]   Well, He's referring partly to the forty days between the resurrection of our Lord
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.040]   and His ascension.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   He gave Him glory.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:09.840]   Oh yes, He even glorified His body.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.720]   But the very fact of the resurrection was giving glory to Him.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:19.580]   Here was a man, apparently just a carpenter, apparently just an ordinary man like every
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.580]   other man.
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.240]   He'd made great claims in his teaching.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.280]   He'd worked mighty deals.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:29.960]   He says that He is the Son of God.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.920]   But God gave proof of it, as I say, in the resurrection, and thereby He gave Him glory.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.080]   And His very body was changed.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:43.480]   It was in a sense the same body, in another sense it wasn't.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.840]   There was some mystery about it.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.720]   Even the disciples couldn't understand it.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   Why?
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.160]   Because He had a glorified body.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.120]   The old body changed, renewed.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.880]   This spiritual change.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.000]   He gave Him glory.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.760]   But you know, that wasn't the only way in which He gave Him glory.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:07.520]   He gave Him glory in another very striking way and manner.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:14.160]   And you see that on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem, as reported in the second chapter
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.040]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.640]   But even before that I must mention this.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.640]   The ascension.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:27.560]   There He is taking certain chosen disciples.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:33.720]   They stand on a mount, and while He speaks with them, He rises and disappears into the
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.720]   heaven.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.520]   But you say, "I don't believe that."
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.240]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.020]   Why don't you believe it?
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.760]   But you say, "Things like that don't happen."
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.160]   Of course they don't happen.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.520]   This is unique.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.520]   This is the Son of God who's come into the world.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.440]   We'll be talking about it at Christmas.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   Do you believe in that?
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.680]   If you can believe that the second Son, second person in the blessed Trinity, the Son of
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:01.520]   God, could be born as a helpless babe, where's your difficulty about believing that He ascended
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.160]   in the body and disappeared into the heaven?
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.120]   God was giving Him glory there.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.560]   God was saying, "This is my Son.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.400]   This person is unique.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.960]   This is no man amongst men.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.720]   This is my Son, God as well as men."
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.720]   The essential.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.680]   And then, as I say, what happened on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem?
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.800]   What was that?
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   The giving and the sending of the Holy Ghost, the pouring out of the Holy Spirit from heaven.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.320]   It was the Son who did it.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.120]   It was the Father who gave Him the power to do it.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.520]   How does that glorify Him?
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.800]   It glorifies Him like this.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.080]   He had said before His death that after He had been received up into glory, He would
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.160]   send another Comforter.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.480]   He said, "I will send the promise of the Father upon you."
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:00.920]   Now He has committed Himself absolutely, in unmistakable terms, to an historical event.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.680]   Here He is saying to these men, "Don't let your hearts be troubled.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.680]   Don't be disconcerted.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.960]   I'm going, yes, but I'm going to send you another Comforter."
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.280]   And again He repeats it just before the ascension.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.320]   "Stay where you are," He says in Jerusalem, "until you receive power."
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.560]   He says, "Ten days hence, I'm going to send upon you the promise of the Father."
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.600]   He has committed Himself to a day, to an absolute date.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:33.560]   He says, "By this you shall know that I am the Son of God."
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:41.400]   And ten days later, the Holy Spirit descended, and the amazing events of the day of Pentecost
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.400]   took place.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.000]   Do you know, my friends, were it not for that, we wouldn't be in this chapel at this moment?
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.960]   Do you know that Christianity has come out of that?
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.240]   The whole story of the Church has come out of that.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   Look at those disciples.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.840]   How could they have turned the world upside down if they had remained as they were?
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.840]   No, no.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.600]   It was this baptism of the Spirit.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.720]   It was this confirmation of His prophecy.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:08.160]   That's the thing that has set Christianity going and has kept it going.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:14.240]   God gave Him glory on the day of Pentecost and continued it by giving miraculous powers
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.240]   to the apostles.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.520]   Have you ever confronted this fact?
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.560]   I'm talking about history, you know.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:25.600]   How comes it that a handful, twelve artisans, ordinary common men who knew no philosophy
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   and had no learning, how did those men manage to make Christianity the main religion, as
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.880]   it were, of the world?
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.520]   How did they conquer the ancient world of Greece and of Rome?
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.520]   How did it happen?
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.520]   There is only one answer.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:47.840]   It was God glorifying His Son by giving these people miraculous utterance, miraculous power
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.640]   to work miracles.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.680]   They were able to do the impossible.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.120]   They are repeating the works of Christ.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:59.440]   And the world was astounded and amazed and believed.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:05.560]   He raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.720]   And why did He do it?
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:18.160]   Well, Peter tells us that in order that your faith and hope might be in God.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.160]   How does it work?
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   It works like this.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:25.280]   I look at all this and I draw the following deductions.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:32.120]   This was the Son of God.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.480]   I can't come to any other conclusion.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.600]   As I read the story, and I plead with you, read it again, read your Gospels during the
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:45.400]   next days, go on and read the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:50.880]   This is the eternal Son of God.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.600]   God has visited this world.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.480]   How did the person of His Son come down?
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.480]   That is my deduction.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.480]   But then I go on and ask a question.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.920]   Why did He come?
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.680]   Why did the Son of God ever come into this world?
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.120]   We have already considered the answer.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.120]   I merely remind you of it this evening.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   It is this.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.760]   For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:21.440]   from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.960]   of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:30.000]   Did you hear the epistle to the Hebrews saying it in chapter 2?
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.800]   We see Jesus, who for the suffering of death was made a little lower than the angels, in
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.360]   order that He might taste death for every man.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.360]   You see, you are bound to face these questions.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.680]   Ask intelligent questions.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.040]   And here are the questions.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:57.640]   If this is the Son of God, well then why did He die in apparent helplessness on that tree?
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:03.880]   Why didn't God waft Him to heaven out of the hands of His enemies and His detractors?
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:07.640]   Well, you know, our Lord has already answered the question.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.480]   Peter and others were a bit annoyed at the fact of His death, and when they saw them
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.280]   coming to arrest Him, Peter took out his sword and was going to strike.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   Put it back, he said.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.640]   "Don't you know that I could commend twelve legions of angels and be carried to heaven?
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.980]   But if I did that, how should I fulfill all righteousness?"
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.120]   My dear friend, there is only one answer.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.640]   The Lord of glory, the Son of God, came into this world in order to die.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.680]   He came to taste death.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:43.560]   To taste death, which means to suffer your death, to take your sins upon Him, to bear
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:49.440]   their punishment, to be put to death as the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.160]   world.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:56.120]   He came and offered Himself, a Lamb without blemish and without spot.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.520]   There is no other answer.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.240]   He is Son of God.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.940]   That's why He wasn't carried to heaven by the angels.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:07.240]   He came to die, and He died.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.760]   In order to save us, I draw that deduction.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.240]   The resurrection proves He is the Son of God.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.360]   Then I go back and say, "Well, then why did He die?"
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.440]   That's why He died.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.080]   He had to die to save me.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.600]   It's the only way whereby I can be ransomed and delivered.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.760]   And you see, the resurrection helps me in another thing, which is this.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.720]   I might have believed that He is the Lamb of God and that God laid my sins upon Him
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.520]   and punished them in Him and that therefore He died.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.400]   Yes, but you know, that alone wouldn't be enough for me.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.240]   I'd always have this lurking question in my mind and heart.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.840]   How do I know that that's enough?
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.120]   How do I know that that satisfies God and His holy law?
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.960]   The answer is the resurrection.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:54.200]   "Delivered for your offenses," says Paul, "but raised again for our justification."
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.840]   God, in the resurrection, is proclaiming that the work was enough.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.360]   He's telling the whole world, "I have done it.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.880]   I've laid your sins upon Him.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.280]   I've punished them.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.240]   I am satisfied.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.080]   He's borne it all."
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.640]   God is proclaiming the eternal satisfaction of Himself and of His law.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:21.200]   So that looking at that, I deduce this further, that God therefore freely forgives me.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.040]   Because Christ has died for me, God forgives me.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.680]   I go beyond that.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.560]   He has adopted me into His family.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.480]   God raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory in order that my faith and hope might
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.720]   be in God.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.480]   And I argue and reason like this.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.000]   I say, "Why did He die?
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   He died for my sins."
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Well, very well.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.760]   He must have loved me or He wouldn't have done it.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:46.880]   And God must have loved me because He wouldn't have sent His Son to die for me if He hadn't
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.880]   loved me.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.280]   I know, therefore, that God loves me.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.600]   But I know it in the light of the death and the resurrection and the glory that He has
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.080]   given Him.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.360]   But I don't stop even there.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:07.680]   I look at Him and I see Him risen from the dead and given glory.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.480]   And I say, "It's all right."
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:17.040]   I say with the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, "We see not yet all things put under
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:24.160]   men but we see Jesus crowned with glory and honor."
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:29.280]   He came down, went through it all, took His part with us, tempted in all points, like
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.280]   as we are men amongst men, as it were.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.640]   And He was killed, He died, He was buried, He rose again.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   He's gone back.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.320]   And all things are under His hand.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.440]   All power, He says, is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440]   Who is this for?
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.440]   Well, it's for men.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.320]   Yes, but I don't see everything under men.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:55.360]   No, no, but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:02.000]   death, crowned with glory and with honor.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.720]   And then I go on to draw my most vital deductions of all.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:14.520]   As I look at this person, this blessed person who came down and suffered and endured and
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:24.000]   died and buried and rose again and ascended and was given glory, I say this.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:34.800]   All that was done for me and for all who believe in Him, I see God is telling me, He's proclaiming
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.960]   that this is done for me.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.160]   And therefore, how do I view my life in this world?
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.020]   I view it like this.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:45.440]   What is happening here is that I am being prepared for that glory which is coming.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.320]   Did you notice again in the second chapter of Hebrews, it became Him that in bringing
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:54.000]   many sons unto glory.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   That's what's happening.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.080]   That's what a Christian believes about himself.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:03.160]   I believe that I'm nothing but a sinner saved by the grace of God.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:08.240]   I believe that I have been forgiven, not because I am what I am, but in spite of it.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.080]   I am forgiven because Christ loved me and died for me.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   What's happening to me?
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:18.560]   Well, God is preparing me for this glory to which Christ has gone.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.520]   Did Christ say that?
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.160]   Let not your heart be troubled, ye believe in God, believe also in me.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.160]   In my Father's house are many mansions.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.760]   If it were not so, I would have told you.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:34.560]   I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:45.080]   again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.080]   What is a Christian?
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:54.440]   A Christian is a man who believes that and who banks his all upon it.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.760]   But he may say, "How am I going to get there?
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.040]   What guarantee have I got that I won't fall or fail or falter?"
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.360]   The answer is this, the resurrection again.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:12.600]   The God who brought him from the dead is more powerful than every enemy and every foe.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:18.520]   The resurrection of Jesus Christ proclaims conquest over death and the grave and the
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.960]   devil and hell.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:31.320]   And the Christian is a man who says this, "Christ is risen, I shall rise."
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.640]   He has no doubt about it.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.040]   He knows that this is not the only life.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:40.280]   He knows he is going to die, that he will be buried, his body will rot in a grave.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:45.720]   He says, "Nevertheless, I shall rise.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.720]   This mortal shall put on immortality.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:53.480]   This corruptible shall put on incorruption."
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:58.080]   He looks at death and the grave and says, "Oh, death, where is thy sting?
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:02.280]   Oh, grave, where is thy victory?
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:07.000]   The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.120]   The thorns be to God that giveth us the victory."
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.120]   How?
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.440]   Through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:21.960]   Christ is risen, we shall rise.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.560]   His resurrection is a guarantee of it.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.920]   God raised him from the dead and gave him glory.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:33.880]   In order that your faith and your hope might be in God and in him alone, very well then
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.360]   believe in this.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:46.240]   The Christian is one who can look at the world at its best, can walk around its galleries
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:55.080]   and look at its most glittering prizes, always accompanied, of course, by the condition that
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:01.560]   you follow its way, that you surrender something of the true nobility of men, and that you
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   go against your conscience, and that you deny the Bible and its teaching and all that is
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.080]   told us about God.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.600]   The Christian is a man who can look at them all.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.760]   Having looked at them all at their godliest, at their best, at their most wonderful, he
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:32.200]   looks at them and says, "Jesus, I, my cross, have taken all to leave and follow thee.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:41.880]   Destitute, despised, forsaken, thou from him my all shalt be."
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:42.880]   Why?
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.560]   Oh, his faith and his hope are in God.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.080]   He sees beyond this world.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.680]   He knows that everything the world has got to give comes to an end when you die.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.480]   You can't take them with you, your jewels, your fineries, your money, your bank balance,
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.440]   your importance, your position, your car, your children, your wife, your land.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:02.560]   No, no, you leave them behind.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:07.000]   His faith and hope hasn't been in these uncertain riches.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.240]   His faith and hope are in God.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:15.720]   So he says with another hymn writer, "Content to let the world go by, to know no gain nor
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:27.080]   loss, my sinful self my only shame, my glory, all the cross."
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.080]   Oh, he takes another look at it all.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.200]   The world comes with its enticements.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.400]   It would have him to put his faith and hope in it.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.880]   "No, no," he says.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:43.280]   "Fading is the worldling's pleasure.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:58.080]   All his busted pomp and show, solid joys and lasting treasure, none but Zion's children
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.200]   now."
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:07.040]   My dear friend, do you believe in God?
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.560]   Are you a faith and hope in God?
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.280]   Have you looked at the evidence?
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:16.160]   Have you seen what God's done in order to make you put your faith and hope in him?
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.360]   He sent his Son into the world.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.240]   But look, I say, at the resurrection.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.240]   Look at that.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.480]   Look at the glory that followed.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.480]   Look at them.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.560]   Draw the inevitable deductions.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:38.440]   And see this night, if you have never seen it before, that God sent him to do all that
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:48.120]   he loved you, and sent his Son into the world to rescue you, to redeem you, that you might
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:58.120]   believe in him and set your faith and your hope in him and in him alone.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.880]   Let the world do what it will.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:05.280]   You cannot be shaken.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:10.680]   You know the only true and living God.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:16.320]   And nothing matters to you but to be right with him.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.800]   Do you believe in God?
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.360]   Are your faith and hope in God?
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:28.600]   If they are, it determines everything you think and everything you do.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.600]   Make certain.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.440]   Amen.
