[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   We talk a lot here about big changes, we're talking massive overhauls to how you organize
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.640]   your life or how you approach your work.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.080]   Today, I thought it might be fun to talk instead about some of the small things that can make
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.240]   a surprisingly big impact on the quality of your life both personally and professionally.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.840]   So in today's deep dive, I have identified eight such small habits and tactics to suggest
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.520]   to you, four of these will be related to the world of work, the other four will be related
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.720]   to your life outside of work, all of them will be oriented at our core goal here of
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.600]   trying to cultivate a deep life in a world that's increasingly drowning in digital distractions.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.840]   Now, here's a key point about what we're about to do here.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.140]   These are small, unusual or interesting habits, not the major things, the major classic pieces
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.440]   of advice that I talk about on this show and in my book, so we're not going to talk about
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.040]   the heavy hitters, the protecting deep work, the practicing multiscale planning, the becoming
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.560]   a digital minimalist, using pull instead of push for workload management, these sort of
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.720]   big classic ideas is not today's goal.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.240]   Today's goal is to small things that sometimes get missed, the surprisingly small ideas that
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.520]   make the surprisingly big difference.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.240]   I've mentioned most of these before in passing, but I'm gathering them for the first time
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.840]   all in one episode.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.060]   Two other quick notes, this is not a comprehensive list, just a bunch of things I thought were
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.060]   interesting.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.460]   There's a lot of things I'm missing that are probably important.
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.700]   It's also not mandatory.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.440]   You don't have to do everything on this list to enjoy the benefits of a deeper life, pick
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.500]   and choose as you see fit.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.700]   All right, let's dive right into it.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.140]   We will start with small ideas to make a big difference in the world of work.
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.340]   Here's my first idea, reciprocal meeting blocks.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.420]   All right, here's how this goes.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.340]   Every time in your context as a knowledge worker in the world of digital technology,
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.740]   every time someone says, "Hey, let's have a meeting that you have to schedule," I want
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.100]   you to schedule a corresponding block of time for the same week that you will then protect
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.660]   for undistracted or deep work.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.000]   Now, you have some give here in terms of the ratio.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.680]   The obvious thing to do is just one to one.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   You want a one-hour meeting?
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.640]   I'm going to find one hour somewhere else in my week to protect time for deep work.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.380]   You could also go with different ratios depending on your job.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.620]   Maybe for every hour of meeting you schedule, you put in a half hour deep work somewhere
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.320]   else or you could go the other way.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.440]   For every hour of meeting I schedule, I want two plus blocks I'm going to schedule to protect
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   for deep work.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.700]   It just depends on the details of what you actually do.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.880]   Here's why this is a nice strategy.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.980]   It doesn't force you to become too rigid about when you have meetings.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.520]   I have a suggestion later on in this list of a more rigid way to deal with meetings,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.080]   but this is if you need some flexibility.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.820]   This takes no time a priori off the table, but what it also does is create a governor
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.600]   on your available time.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.860]   As more meetings get scheduled for a week, more time gets grayed out.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.580]   There's less time left for a meeting to fit in that week and more meetings just won't
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.940]   happen or they'll get pushed to later weeks.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.260]   It ensures that in your quest in the moment to be responsive to the needs of other people
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.580]   in your digital office, that you don't have your schedule become overly saturated with
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.580]   meetings.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.500]   I want to give you a bonus sub tip here, it's related.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.260]   When you schedule a meeting on your calendar, add 20 minutes to the end.
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.400]   I call this the recovery block.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.220]   It gives you time after the scheduled meeting is over to first of all, take progress, make
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.880]   progress and organize the stuff that came out of the meeting to make sure that the obligations
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.160]   that arose get written down and whatever systems you use to track your obligations.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.440]   If there's quick things you can do right away, like, okay, I promised to send out this file
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.200]   and to follow up with someone else, you can do that right there.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.100]   So it doesn't have to just float in the back of your mind.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.020]   It also gives your mind chance to just clear out the attention residue of the meeting to
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.320]   begin to recover from the cognitive act of being part of that focused discussion, so
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.400]   that it'll be easier to move on to what's next.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.640]   Without these recovery blocks, if you go from meeting to meeting, it's difficult because
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.960]   a the small tasks generated by the meeting will sit in your head, taking up resources,
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.100]   oh, my God, I gonna have to do this, right?
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.600]   It's just sitting there distracting you as you move on to the next meeting.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.960]   And it can be whiplash, cognitive whiplash to go from one meeting to another recovery
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   blocks.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.120]   Again, this is all tricks for playing with your calendar and meetings.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.720]   Recovery blocks make a big difference.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.840]   All right, here's my second small idea, work quotas.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.520]   For common types of work tasks that you're asked to do on a regular basis and that are
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:03.080]   important to your job, the things you can't just not do, establish quotas.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.960]   Here is how many of this particular types of projects I do per month, or maybe per quarter,
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.880]   or maybe per year, depending on the type of work we're talking about.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.560]   And when you have these quotas, here's what happens.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.840]   You can say yes to these things until the quota is full.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.040]   Once the quota is full, you have to start saying no, because your quota is full, but
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.640]   now you have a good reason for saying no.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.220]   You can say to the interested party, you know, thanks for the request.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.400]   This is obviously an important part of what I do.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.340]   I maintain a quota of doing five of these per season, and I've already hit that quota,
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.480]   so I can't take this on right now, but you know, I'm going to continue to be engaged
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.720]   in this going forward.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.600]   The nice thing about the quota rationale is that it's hard to push back against.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.840]   If I'm the person who wants you to do something, yes, I want you to do it.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.420]   But if you say I have a quota, and it's a reasonable quota, and you've hit that quota,
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.600]   my only comeback at this point is your quota should be bigger.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.040]   If your quota is reasonable, they're like, well, that's a lot of work, so let's be concrete
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.040]   about this.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.600]   You know, I have a quota for peer review requests.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   I'm a full professor.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   I get a lot of requests to review papers.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.280]   It's an important part of my job.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.500]   I get way more requests than I can possibly actually fulfill.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   So I have a quota.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.200]   When I come back and say, OK, you know, I've already hit my quota for this semester.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.840]   I use semester because I'm an academic.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.360]   If that number is pretty large for the requesting person, like, OK, you're doing a lot of reviews,
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.080]   and that's a reasonable amount of reviews to do, and it's reasonable that you're done
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.640]   for this semester, let me move on to someone else.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.560]   It's much more precise than simply saying, I don't know, I'm busy, because everyone's
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.840]   busy.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.600]   They want you to do this thing to make their life easier.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.880]   So you need a better reason.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.520]   Quotas are good reasons.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.720]   Here's an advanced tip surrounding quotas.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.840]   Predictably look ahead and be willing to use the quota to turn down requests before the
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   quota is full.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.800]   Let me be more concrete about this.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   If you know, like in my case, that there's some number of peer review papers you do each
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.360]   semester and a request comes in, and it's not a very important review, the paper's maybe
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.660]   not, by not important, I mean not important for you.
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.240]   So maybe it's not a great mix, a match for your expertise, or it's not a very good venue.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.040]   You can say, look, I'm coming close to my quota for papers for this semester, and I
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.200]   want to leave the last final spots for some papers I expect that are coming up.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.520]   Papers that are maybe like a stronger match for my expertise.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.800]   Or you might have a specific reason to expect in the near future you're going to have some
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.520]   more requests come in.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.160]   So it might be like, look, I need to wait here because there's this big conference in
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.160]   my field coming up.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160]   I'm going to get some review requests.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.320]   I want to keep some slots open in my quota.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:53.000]   So you can predictably turn things down based on your assumption that better things for
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.320]   your quota is going to come in the future.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.480]   But what you get here is clarity.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.780]   You're still doing important things, but you are controlling the load, the number of those
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.640]   things that you do.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:08.500]   All right, small habit or ritual or task, tactic number three, coordination Mondays
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.500]   and summer Fridays.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:17.860]   And this is the third of our four work-related small things to make a big difference.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.020]   Coordination Mondays and summer Fridays is a philosophy for thinking about how you deal
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.020]   with different days during your work week.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.700]   So coordination Mondays, this concept says, I think about Mondays as the day where it's
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.020]   all about organizing my work and collaboration.
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.500]   It's where I get a handle on what's going on.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.100]   I check in with people.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.340]   I learn more about things that need to be done.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.660]   I organize and make sense of the work that has been done and get a better sense of what's
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.660]   still coming.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.040]   Mondays is when I do this.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.620]   So what this means, for example, is if you're going to ask someone for a meeting, you're
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.140]   like, okay, I need to talk to this person.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.140]   Whatever it is, the work he wants me to do, or she wants me to do or the work we're working
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.140]   on together.
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.260]   We got to talk about this, right?
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.900]   Your default is like, hey, let's find some time on Monday.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.180]   Because that's when I do this coordination.
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:12.740]   You can also have a really big prominent office hours on these Mondays, a big two hour block,
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.580]   where a lot of these meetings, instead of actually scheduling them individually, so
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.380]   just any time during this two hours on Monday, just like call me or stop by my office and
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.380]   we'll get into this.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.680]   Like your mode on Monday is I want to talk about projects, I want to talk to other people
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.380]   about projects, I want to figure out where things stand.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.780]   You can also spend the first hour to 90 minutes of your day and coordination Mondays just
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:37.860]   working on your own plans, getting your weekly plan in place, looking through your task systems
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.980]   and cleaning that up and organizing it all of the sort of maintenance of keeping an organized
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.020]   life and digital knowledge work.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.720]   Monday is all about this.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.460]   Someone asked you for a meeting, hey, can we talk to get into this like, yeah, I try
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.380]   to like, dedicate my Mondays to getting my arms around things.
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.980]   So let me know when you're free on Monday.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:10:00.740]   In fact, you can even have a scheduling application for Monday where you have, you know, all of
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.220]   your non-office hour times between 11am at the end of the day, just available for meeting
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:11.220]   slots and just throw this link at people like candy on Halloween or beads on Mardi Gras.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.500]   Yeah, let's grab a time, grab a time, anyone bothering you, grab a time on Monday, grab
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.140]   a time on Monday, any Monday you want.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.140]   We'll talk about it.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.140]   Monday is my coordination day.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.460]   If you can get away with this, it makes a big difference because what happens on Tuesday,
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.780]   Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, they're much more clear.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:31.260]   You're able to actually make progress on work, this focus on something for a long amount
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.460]   of time to get your, to get your head around something without having to constantly switch
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.480]   your context back and forth.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.700]   And the coordination Monday is such a simple heuristic.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.980]   You don't have to remember a lot of complicated scheduling details in the moment.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.300]   You just have this simple heuristic push to Monday, push to Monday.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.340]   So now you can really handle all these incoming and outgoing requests to chat or talk and
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.340]   collaborate.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.580]   You can handle with handle them all easily by just deferring to Monday.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.060]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.560]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:07.020]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:12.460]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:17.820]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.640]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   Check it out.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.020]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.260]   The other end of this is summer Fridays.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.500]   Well, summer Friday is a reference to how the publishing industry schedules their work
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.060]   during the summer, which is they end work early on Fridays.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:37.960]   Traditionally, this is when the old school editors needed to leave early to get to their
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   Hamptons houses.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.960]   All right.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.620]   Now it just becomes a perk of the publishing industry.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.120]   The summer is a slower time.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.100]   They lean into this by saying Fridays are half days, they're not meeting days.
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.980]   You get in, you get some stuff done, have a longer weekend.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.820]   I suggest simulate this as much as possible.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.220]   Again, how do you simulate this?
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.540]   It all comes down to your scheduling decisions in the moment.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.100]   Don't offer up Friday afternoons for meetings.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.100]   Just don't offer them up.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:10.060]   If someone asks you, I'm busy then, but how about Monday or whatever day, right?
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.300]   That will eliminate 95% of your Friday afternoon meetings.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.140]   Now what this allows you to do is to have a real good shutdown at like one o'clock or
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.240]   two o'clock on Fridays, and then without making a big deal of it, move on to something else.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.540]   If you have a lot of autonomy, just move on and have an afternoon to unwind.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.700]   If you don't have a lot of autonomy, then you have to sort of fake being around.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:38.940]   You maybe still have to be in your office or do a symbolic email response block at 4:30,
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.740]   but you can be checking up mentally, working on another project, reading, exercising, doing
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.580]   something different during those times.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.220]   Just having this slow windup into the weekend makes a big difference.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.980]   That little bit of extra time when the world is still working makes a big difference.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.780]   Coordination Mondays, summer Fridays, it's all about how you conceptually think about
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.240]   your schedule, but it makes a really big difference, especially in a sort of highly distracted
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.240]   workplace environment.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.060]   All right, my fourth piece of advice, this is a small thing, but a common thing.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.060]   I swear by this.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.060]   You have to do this.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.140]   I'm just going to emphasize it again and again.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:18.260]   If you work at a computer, you need to use a working memory.txt file.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.540]   The idea here is really straightforward.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.300]   You got a text file on your desktop.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:30.220]   I use a Mac, so I'm using TextEdit, and I make the text file plain formatting.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.620]   No fonts, no bolds, nothing like that.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.620]   Okay, what is this file used for?
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:41.180]   Throughout the day, it is what you use as an extension of your brain.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.180]   When you're working on a particular project, the working memory.txt, you type things in
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.860]   so you don't have to hold it all straight in your head.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.740]   You're trying to think about what are the four points I want to make in this presentation.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.200]   That's where you can write them down.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.740]   When you're in a meeting and there's, okay, action items are coming up, suggestions, things
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.140]   you need to do are coming up, you're taking those notes just right there on working memory.txt.
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.540]   You have a place to put that where it's not just in your head.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.660]   When you're cleaning your inbox, you're putting notes in there.
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.660]   You're keeping track of like, okay, this message, I need to do this, remember to do this.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.940]   You're just writing down as fast as you can type, like summaries of stuff you have to
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.100]   do as you clear through these messages in your inbox.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.100]   Almost whatever you're doing, it is an extension where you hold information that can't all
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.100]   fit in your head.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.340]   And then you process all that information next time you get a chance.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.980]   When you're cleaning your inbox, taking things out of the actual inbox, you might be growing
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.860]   this list of different things that came out of this inbox.
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.820]   And then when you're done processing your inbox, you make sense of this list, you realize
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.900]   a few of these things you can skip, a couple you deal with there, the other things you
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.900]   move on to your calendar till your to-do list.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.060]   But this memory sits here because you can't keep this all track of all this in your head.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.620]   So it sits there, right there.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.620]   Why a text file?
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.020]   Because you can type so fast.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.480]   You can just type as fast as you're thinking, as fast as people are saying things.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.020]   Don't worry about formatting, just rock and roll on this list.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.760]   My workingmemory.txt grows and contracts throughout the day.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.280]   And if I have an interruption, I can come back later that day or the next day and know
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.180]   exactly what was going on by seeing what notes were left in the workingmemory.txt file.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.820]   So this is a key bit of cybernetic productivity, but it's critical.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:25.380]   You work at a computer, use a workingmemory.txt file to be a literal digital extension of
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.380]   your brain.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.620]   All right, so those are ideas for the world of work.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.560]   Let's give a couple quick ideas here, small things that make a big difference for living
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.940]   a deeper life in your life outside of work.
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:43.340]   The first thing I want to suggest here is the use of single purpose notebooks.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.020]   And this is something we discussed on the show, I think a couple months ago.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:51.620]   But the idea is the following, when you have a particular problem that's particularly complicated
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.580]   that you're working on, and this could be a personal problem, like you're trying to
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:00.140]   figure out how do I fix this part of my life or this unhappiness I have, or it could be
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.620]   a particular professional problem, sure, like, what is this a book I want to write going
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.620]   to be about?
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.340]   Or how do I overhaul my company?
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.300]   It's a struggling and I want to make it more successful, or it's successful, but I'm drowning.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:17.060]   I want to reimagine what my company could be like when it was less overwhelming.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:22.620]   Whatever the problem is, dedicate a single small notebook to this problem.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.000]   I recommend using a Fields Notes notebook.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.740]   These are very small.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.800]   They fit easily in your pocket.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.060]   Have a good pen, non-bleed pen to use.
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:37.620]   I like Uniball Micro 0.5 millimeter ballpoint pens, but you can use whatever you prefer
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.720]   to use and bring this notebook with you.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.780]   Now whenever you have a thought about the single problem, you have a single place to
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.460]   write it down.
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:54.540]   Now you can go, you know, on a dedicated thinking excursion, like, okay, I'm going to go to
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.220]   this coffee shop and just think for 20 minutes about this problem.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.340]   You have a way of doing that.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.580]   Bring the notebook, take notes.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.940]   The notes accrete in this notebook, and over time, it's going to help you come up with
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.340]   a solution to the problem in hand.
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.560]   Now the key about this is by having this notebook with you wherever you go, by having a ready-made
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:20.180]   place to put thoughts or insights as they arrive, you're going to get probably 5X more
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:25.380]   brain power than if you just instead say, "I'm going to schedule a time to sit and think
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.780]   about this problem," or "I'm going to get together with someone and we're going to talk
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.780]   about this problem and solve it in a meeting."
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.780]   Because you're tapping so much more of your brain in so many different more mind states.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.580]   You're tapping so many more momentary insights and fresh starts and bursts of energy.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:46.460]   It is an accelerant to the insight that your brain can generate when you have a notebook
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.100]   with you at all times dedicated to a single problem.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.940]   It's a powerful tool.
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:56.460]   I suggest it for making sense of your life or any other big problem you're facing.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:02.220]   Second small thing for your life outside of work, take thinking walks, preferably every
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.220]   day.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.860]   Now, a thinking walk is where you go for a walk.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.800]   We're outside now.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:14.820]   Go for a walk and think about yourself, your life, or something that's on your mind.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.140]   It doesn't have to be profound.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.220]   It could just be kind of fun.
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:26.220]   You're toying with a fantasy of what if we moved over here or a new hobby you're into.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.780]   Or it could be something like, "I'm excited about something.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.980]   Let me go think about it, what this means," or "I'm upset or ashamed of something.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.100]   Let me go make sense of this.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.260]   Let me walk and think about it.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.660]   What am I liking about my life?
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.060]   What am I not liking about my life?"
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.340]   It's being alone with your own thoughts and enjoying the company of your own thoughts.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:50.420]   Do this walking, not sitting, not in a car, not in a train, but actually out there walking
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.220]   in nature.
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.380]   This is how humans grow.
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.140]   This is how humans make sense of the messiness that is life.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.320]   This is how humans find meaning and resilience among the hardness.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:10.580]   They have to grapple with the world within their own interiority, and this requires thinking,
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.980]   and walking's the best way to think.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.500]   Now, there's a couple other benefits you get from this.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.660]   A, it's just really nice to be outside.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.780]   We're wired to be outside.
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.140]   You hear the birds.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.220]   You feel the different changes in the weather.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.620]   It's just going to be good for you as a human.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.020]   It also gets you used to not always having a screen to distract you at a moment's notice.
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.900]   You'll break that dopamine loop where it says, "Man, we are so close to getting a screen
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:32.900]   fixed.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.900]   Let's just do that.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.900]   We got to do that.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.900]   We got to do that."
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.900]   Because when you're doing a thinking walk, you're not looking at your screen.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.420]   You get used to that as a state.
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:44.340]   It really does make your life shift from black and white to technicolor when you're able
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.260]   to spend time to actually make sense of what you're seeing on this metaphorical screen.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:54.140]   All right, third piece of advice for life outside of work, never post.
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.420]   Again, something we've talked about recently on the show, but I want to underscore here.
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.060]   I'm not a big fan of social media.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.460]   Other people use it.
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:08.820]   There's definitely some positive information or purposes that people deploy with social
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.820]   media.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.820]   That's all fine.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.660]   But I'm going to argue, don't post unless you really, really have to.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:19.140]   If you run a business or you're a public figure, sure, have a professional posting schedule
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.660]   that serves a really good need.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.900]   Okay, this is specifically how I post.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.820]   Preferably have someone else do the posting for you.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.980]   Never read the responses.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.980]   That's fine.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.420]   But if you're not a public figure, just don't post.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:39.380]   It's in the posting that you get the deepest tendrils of the social media addiction mind
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.500]   warping machine into your brain.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:47.820]   It's when you post that you begin to obsess over what these faceless digital denizens
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.580]   think about you and what you're saying.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.980]   It's where you get the anxiety of do they like this, the euphoria of they do and the
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.780]   pain of that they don't.
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.420]   You get the isolation and life destruction of canceling campaigns or imagine canceling
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.160]   campaigns that might come if you just say or don't do the right thing.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.860]   That's what begins to warp your understanding of the world to be based off of the feedback
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.300]   you're getting from this very artificial algorithmically amplified crowd.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.020]   It will change what you believe to be true.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.740]   It'll change how you approach your life.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.140]   It's most likely going to create a digital cage of unhappiness.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.140]   So don't post.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.660]   If there's certain things you like to consume, like, yeah, I'm a baseball fan.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.220]   I like to see what this reporter has to say about my baseball team.
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.260]   These comedians are funny.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.260]   I like comedy.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.260]   They post funny things.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.440]   I want to see what's going on here.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.700]   The independent media I'm interested in breaks stories on Twitter and that's interesting
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.700]   to me.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.700]   Okay, you can find ways to deal with that.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.960]   But just don't post yourself unless you're in a situation where it's really notable that
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.960]   you're not.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.620]   And even if you are in that situation, consider don't posting.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.380]   I don't post on social media, and I somehow still managed to get by.
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.380]   All right, final small thing I want to suggest here that can make a big difference.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.900]   Do something hard.
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.460]   Discipline is practiced.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.680]   It's not a character trait.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.020]   It's not a binary that you choose to be disciplined or not.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.580]   It's more of like a threshold.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.860]   The more you practice discipline, the more comfortable you are doing hard things that
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.060]   aren't going to give you rewards in the moment.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.100]   The more comfortable you are sticking with hard things, even when other distractions
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.460]   are pulling at you, the more disciplined you are, the more likely you are to keep reorienting
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.900]   your actions around the things you care about most, even if they don't lead to the easiest
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.640]   decisions in the moment.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.100]   This is a practice.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.820]   The more you practice discipline, the higher the threshold gets, and therefore the easier
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.620]   it is to do these demonstrations of discipline.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:42.740]   So the best way to begin practicing discipline, to see yourself more as a disciplined person,
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.060]   is to do something hard.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.300]   And when you're done with that, do another thing hard, and then something else.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.360]   You will change your self-conception if you do this.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.020]   As your discipline threshold grows, you'll quite literally see yourself more and more
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.540]   as someone who can resist things you shouldn't be doing and do the things you should be doing,
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.140]   even if you don't want to.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.580]   Start modestly.
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.260]   Physical things tend to work well for people as a starting point here.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.280]   I'm going to change something about my diet, I'm going to change something about my exercise.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.280]   Don't make this too small.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.800]   It really should be hard, but also don't do too many things.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.900]   Don't say I'm going to overhaul all of my health.
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:19.100]   Instead say, you know, I'm not going to drink at all for three months, or I'm going to do
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.660]   a workout, even if it's only 15 minutes, I'll start easy every single day.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.740]   I'm just going to make that a big part of my life.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.860]   So you do something hard.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.100]   It could also be intellectual, I'm going to read this collection of great books.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.500]   It could be craft oriented, I'm finally going to build this canoe, but it's going to require
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.700]   a lot of skills, but I'm just going to do this thing.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.580]   You need to be a little bit obsessive about the thing, you need to schedule time in advance,
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:42.620]   you need to come back to it relentlessly, prioritize it above other non-professional,
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.260]   non-family obligations.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.260]   But do something hard, and then when you're done, do something else hard.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.980]   Get in a habit of doing hard things that are not required.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.580]   Your discipline threshold will grow, your identity as a disciplined person will solidify,
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.020]   and this will be the fuel for almost anything else you want to do as part of the quest to
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.900]   cultivate a deeper life in a distracted world.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.300]   All right, so those are my eight small things that I think will make a big difference.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.840]   I'll summarize each of them real quick.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:15.660]   For work, use reciprocal meeting blocks, use work quotas, implement coordination Mondays
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.620]   and summer Fridays, and always have workingmemory.txt open.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.060]   For life outside of work, use single-purpose notebooks for big challenges, take thinking
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:29.780]   walks daily, never post if you can avoid it, and do something hard all the time.
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.700]   Once you're done with something else hard, do something after that, and after that, and
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.700]   after that.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.060]   All right, it's not a comprehensive list.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.060]   These aren't the major heavy hitter advice I have, but it's sometimes these small things
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.580]   that can add up to make the biggest difference.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.460]   So keep these eight tactics in mind.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:50.700]   All right, so we have a great collection of questions, but first, I want to give a word
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:55.300]   from one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.460]   Let's talk Cozy Earth.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.980]   I miss my Cozy Earth sheets.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.060]   I miss my Cozy Earth comforter cover.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.060]   Why?
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.460]   Because I am on vacation and they do not have Cozy Earth sheets up here.
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.460]   I love them.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.660]   I've said this on the show all the time.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:15.140]   There's something about this bamboo-derived material that is the most comfortable sheets
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.140]   I ever have.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.760]   We now own, I think, three different pairs, sets of these sheets.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:25.140]   No matter where we are in the cleaning cycle, we have a pair of Cozy Earth sheets to put
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.140]   on our bed.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.140]   They're super soft.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.140]   They're super comfortable.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.260]   They run cool, even when it's warmer in the summer.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:37.780]   I didn't know how much I cared about my sheets until I got Cozy Earth sheets.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:38.780]   Here's the good news.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.660]   I have a discount code just for you.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:49.580]   If you go to CozyEarth.com/Cal and use the discount code CAL, you'll get 30% off.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:56.340]   You will also get free socks if you do the survey and say, "Where did I hear about Cozy
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.340]   Earth?
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.900]   I heard about it from the Deep Questions podcast."
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.180]   Use CAL to get 30% off at CozyEarth.com and then get free socks if you tell them I sent
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.460]   you in the post-purchase survey.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.240]   There's a lot of cool clothing things that Cozy Earth has.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.360]   My wife has the pajamas.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.860]   I have a sweatshirt made out of the same comfortable material.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:20.200]   I brought it up here to New England because it's cooler up here at night and I've really
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   been liking it.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   Cozy Earth, big fan.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   Go to CozyEarth.com/Cal.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:29.840]   Get 30% off at CozyEarth.com/Cal when you use the discount code CAL.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:35.640]   Don't forget to tell them that the Deep Questions podcast sent you here in the post-purchase
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.440]   survey and you'll get a free pair of socks.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.960]   I also want to talk about our longtime sponsor, Grammarly.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.940]   In knowledge work, writing is now everything.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.800]   You just write all the time, especially as work becomes increasingly remote.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   You're writing emails.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.920]   You're writing Slack messages.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   You're writing memos.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.520]   You're writing presentations.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.820]   You're writing social media posts.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.800]   You're writing blog posts and newsletters.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.080]   Writing is how you put forth yourself in the professional world.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.000]   You need your writing to be as sharp and on point and appropriate as possible.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.160]   This is where Grammarly enters the scene.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.300]   Grammarly is an AI writing partner that helps you get work done faster with high quality
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.080]   writing for better projects, proposals, presentations, and more.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.040]   It works where you work.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.300]   I'm on Google Docs.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.480]   I'm in Slack.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   I'm writing an email.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   I'm in Microsoft Word.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.280]   Where it is you're doing your writing, Grammarly is there to help.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.880]   Grammarly's technology has really been making leaps recently.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.120]   It can do a lot.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.900]   It's no longer just telling you, for example, "Oh, there's grammatical mistakes here."
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.360]   The AI intelligence keeps getting smarter in the Grammarly tool, so now it can help
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.840]   you do things, for example, like adjust the tone of what you're writing.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.080]   Make it more professional or less professional.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.640]   It can come in and help you actually brainstorm.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.920]   You can ask it things like, "Can you give me five ideas for captions for a photo about
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920]   whatever?"
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.200]   It can give you ideas to help you break through writer's blocking, get moving quickly.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.440]   It can rewrite paragraphs for you.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.940]   It can make suggestions.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.000]   Really the power of this tool just continues to grow.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.480]   Grammarly now works across 500,000 apps and websites.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.760]   96% of Grammarly users report that it helps them craft more impactful writing, so you
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.440]   can be confident that it can do the same for you.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.440]   All right, so get AI writing support that works where you work.

[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.280]   said, done.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:44.160]   All right, let's move on to some questions.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.000]   Without Jesse here to ask the questions, I got a coffee up.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.680]   To those who are watching instead of just listening, you can see I'm taking my coffee
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.360]   break to prepare for these questions.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.920]   All right, let's get rolling here.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.640]   Our first question comes from Kurt.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.520]   Kurt says, "I'm a devout user of the Time Block Planner.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:08.760]   However, I struggle to use the weekly plan space, partially because of my atrocious handwriting,
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.840]   but also because the weekly plan changes so much in the week.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.120]   I recall you talking about when you make your weekly plan, you will read through your Trello
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:21.640]   cards and notes and then make your plan in your working memory.txt.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   That's where my weekly plan has been stored, but you recently spoke of wiping that text
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.080]   file clear in your daily shutdown.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.680]   Where do you keep your digital weekly plan?"
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.400]   All right, a couple points here.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.400]   Great question, Kurt.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   A couple points.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.740]   First of all, location for your weekly plan.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.000]   This is preference.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.440]   A lot of people like to handwrite the weekly plan because it makes it concrete, it slows
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.980]   them down, it makes them trust it more.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:47.080]   So that's why we have a space in the Time Block Planner each week for writing your weekly
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.080]   plan.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.280]   Other people prefer to do it digitally because they type faster than they write.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:57.480]   They like to make verbose weekly plans, so too big to put in a planner space.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   And they like to change it more.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.480]   They like to tweak it more.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.840]   They have more movable weekly plans.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.520]   So if that's you, digital is completely fine.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.680]   A text file is great.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.260]   You can put it in working memory.txt.
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.760]   I often do this.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.080]   When I put it in working memory.txt, I just put it at the top of the file, and I build
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.360]   a big border with like equal sign lines.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:23.940]   It's like equal sign lines across, capital, weekly plan, line of equal signs.
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.920]   Weekly plan there, dividing line of equal signs, and I don't wipe that part of working
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.920]   memory.txt, and everything below it is to working memory.txt that I then manipulate.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.040]   Other people like to email their weekly plan to themselves.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.400]   They just have that comfort of when they check their inbox, they see it there.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.380]   And so they know, oh, I have a weekly plan.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.200]   Some people just put it in its own dedicated text file.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.600]   Some people will put it in a dedicated file and print it and have the printout at their
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.600]   desk.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.160]   And then if they change the weekly plan, they print a new copy.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.120]   So they have a printed version to look at each day, so they don't have to be on their
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.920]   computer to see what they're supposed to be doing.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.880]   All of these are fine.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.560]   The key is having a weekly plan discipline.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.200]   This is part of the secret sauce of my multi-scale planning.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.320]   Looking at the week ahead, figuring out what needs to be done, where you're going to do
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.460]   it, what you might need to move really makes a big difference.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:16.560]   If you just take each day as it comes, your aperture is too narrow.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.140]   You really do want to plan for the whole week.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.500]   All right.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.480]   Our next question here comes from Nicole.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.740]   Nicole said, "I've just realized I am nowhere in life because I always give myself what
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.500]   I want.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.620]   If I want a carbonated drink, I'll give it to myself.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.540]   If I want to watch TV, I'll do that.
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.620]   There's no denial of pleasure.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.260]   So it seemed that to succeed in life, your pleasure comes after the hard work.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.420]   Do you experience any pleasure during deep work?"
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:52.900]   Well, Nicole, we have to think about a couple different types of pleasure here.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.060]   Might also use the term satisfaction, okay?
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.780]   There's dopamine, dopamine reward pleasure.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:05.260]   And I'm not using dopamine here in this sort of vague sense that we sometimes hear about
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.540]   it's just addiction or dopamine makes me do things.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.580]   But if we get really specific about the dopamine system, what it does is it gives you this
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:18.060]   sense of action towards anticipated reward.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.260]   Like you're near something like that carbonated drink and your mind associates that, like
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.700]   we're going to enjoy drinking that.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.720]   So it's something we should probably do.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   Dopamine floods your brain and it gives you this sense of sort of compulsion attraction
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.740]   to doing that thing.
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.840]   This is the relationship, of course, we have with our phones often.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.460]   Our mind's like, we're probably going to see something on there that could be like interesting.
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.580]   It could be an email about us with good news.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.580]   It could be a really funny post.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.180]   It could be something kind of outrageous.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.540]   That's going to feel pretty good.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.700]   We should do things that feel good.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.540]   So dopamine response, and the dopamine response is that compulsive sense of like, I need to
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.900]   pick this up.
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.540]   Dopamine derived pleasures are often moderate.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:59.100]   When you do finally drink that carbonated soda or you do look at that phone, you're
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.260]   like, "Yeah, that kind of tasted good.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.820]   Oh yeah, that was kind of funny."
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.080]   You know, it's not some great reward, right?
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   It's fleeting.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.080]   It's momentary.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.240]   So the compulsion is not because this, I'm going to feel really great.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.840]   It's just your mind's like, we want good things.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:20.120]   When you do something hard, like you're working on a book chapter and it's really hard, you're
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.260]   not in a flow state.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.760]   It's more of like a deliberate practice state.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.980]   It's very difficult.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.080]   There's a deeper pleasure that you get out of that.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.080]   And especially once it's done, that does not come from the dopamine system.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.840]   It instead comes from the future prediction system.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:37.020]   The part of your brain that predicts the future says doing this longer term thing is good
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.020]   for us.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.860]   It will lead to good things down the line.
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.960]   So let's go execute this plan.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:47.620]   This future prediction system makes you feel good when plans are executed, but it's a deeper,
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.580]   more fulfilling type of good feeling.
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:54.140]   It's a more lasting type of good feeling.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.500]   It's the satisfaction.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.740]   I'm paraphrasing Matt Crawford here as I often do.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:03.060]   The quiet satisfactions of being able to point to an intention made concrete manifestly in
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.020]   the world.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.420]   That's a different type of pleasure.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.080]   I accomplished a plan that I thought was useful pleasure.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.300]   That's what you really want to get "addicted" to, Nicole.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.300]   That feeling of I'm making progress on an important plan that leads me to something
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.940]   good down the line.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.860]   Not the dopamine pleasure of this might feel good in the moment.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.860]   Let's really do it.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.500]   And then you do it and it doesn't match up to that intense compulsion you felt in the
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.520]   moment to do it.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.780]   So yeah, there are different types of pleasures.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:36.960]   To practice this deeper sort of pleasure, discipline matters.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:42.040]   So go back to the deep dive where I recommended practicing doing hard things.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.140]   That just gets you used to what that type of satisfaction feels like and makes it something
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.720]   that's more attractive to you.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.780]   You can also deprogram the dopamine pleasures.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.500]   There's a couple things to do here.
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.140]   One, just be more comfortable with discomfort.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:01.380]   I'm sort of stealing this idea from Michael Easter and his book, The Comfort Crisis.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.860]   Your brain might say, "I'm bored and I really want to look at the TV right now.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.860]   It's going to be great.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:07.860]   We might find something fun on there."
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.340]   And you say, "I'm just not going to do that because that's not in my plan right now.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.340]   That's not in my interest."
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.060]   And just be like, "I'm going to feel uncomfortable about that.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.500]   My brain will rebel and I'm going to feel bored and bad, and then it will get better.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.140]   And I'm okay feeling bored and bad.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.300]   That's not what I'm trying to avoid."
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:26.180]   So just being more comfortable with the discomfort that follows from defying your dopamine system
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.540]   goes a long way.
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:33.820]   Also for deactivating these dopamine responses around specific things, have alternative habits
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.100]   as well.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.860]   I don't want to grab a drink here.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:44.380]   Have an alternative thing you do that gives you a different type of reward and just relentlessly
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.420]   go to the alternative activity when you feel the compulsion for the thing you're trying
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.420]   to do less of.
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.100]   So you can deprogram some of these dopamine responses.
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.940]   But yes, to get to your original question, there's a sort of a deeper satisfaction that
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.620]   comes from executing a hard but worthwhile plan that's very different than dopamine-driven
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.620]   satisfactions.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.500]   It's the type of satisfaction you want to reorient your life more around.
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:11.060]   All right, rolling along here, we got a question from Mike.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.060]   Here's a classic question.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.260]   I hear this one a lot.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:18.940]   Mike says, "On a weekly basis, what is a good number of deep work sessions to strive for,
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:22.020]   assuming my typical work week is Monday through Friday?"
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.300]   Mike, this depends on your job.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:28.620]   In my book, Deep Work, I talk about your ideal deep to shallow work ratio, where I say you
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:33.420]   should identify for your particular job in a typical week.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.900]   What is the ideal ratio of deep work hours to non-deep work hours for being as useful
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.160]   as possible to your employer?
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.380]   For some jobs, this will be pretty high, like mainly what they need you to do is deep work
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.860]   with just like a small amount of shallow work to sort of keep up with administrative things.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.900]   For other jobs, this might be very low.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.660]   There are some things we want you to do that require uninterrupted hours, but there's a
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.660]   ton of stuff we need you to do that we need you to be more responsive.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:00.020]   You need to know what the answer is, what your ratio is for your particular job.
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.160]   I suggest talk to your boss or supervisor about this.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.140]   Work with them to get this answer so they have skin in the game on this is the ratio
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.940]   that's ideal.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.580]   Why is it useful to have a number?
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.840]   Well, now you have something to aim for.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.100]   And if you're getting much less, hitting much less that number, now you have impetus to
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.100]   improve.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.260]   It's not just a generic sense of I should do more deep work.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.580]   Because I'm trying to get to 12 hours, I'm trying to get to 25 hours, I'm well short,
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.940]   what can I do to get there?
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.940]   It also gets your boss or your team on board.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:35.940]   Because now you're able to say, hey, remember how we agreed that let's say, for example,
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.340]   50/50 deep to shallow work is ideal for me being valuable for this company.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.860]   I'm only getting 20% deep work to 80 shallow.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.380]   So what should we do to fix this?
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:49.260]   And you would be surprised once you have a real metric that has a positive purpose, you'd
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:54.380]   be surprised by how many changes will now be possible, how many changes the boss will
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.460]   now suggest, oh, let's do this, let's do that.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.300]   Because you're working towards a positive metric.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.540]   One tweak I want to add, because I talked about the deep to shallow work ratio a lot,
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.900]   and there's some complexities around it, one tweak I want to add.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:12.980]   When measuring this, your deep to shallow work hours, you needed a full hour dedicated
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.860]   to deep work for it to count as deep work hour.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.500]   So you can't have like 20 minutes here, 40 minutes here, 30 minutes there and 30 minutes
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.620]   there and say, okay, that's two hours of deep work, because if you don't have at least a
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:26.020]   full hour, you're not really getting the benefits of non-distraction, you still are dealing
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.460]   with the intention residue from the thing before too much, it's too fragmented.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:35.020]   You need to count up like sessions, deep work sessions that last at least an hour to add
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.500]   their minutes to your total deep work count when calculating these ratios.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:46.100]   All right, another deep work question here, this one comes from Sam.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:51.980]   Sam says, I just read the section in deep work about the four disciplines of execution,
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.260]   the first being to focus on the wildly important.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.740]   How do we apply this to our personal lives?
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:02.260]   I have so many goals I want to pursue, and I find it difficult to prioritize all of them.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.380]   Well, Sam, what I typically suggest is that you first need to divide your personal life
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.300]   into different areas that you find important.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.980]   We often use the lingo of buckets here on the show, it's like a bucket for like family
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:18.060]   and community, a bucket for constitution, like your health, a bucket for contemplation,
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:22.020]   this is like theological or philosophical foundations for how you live, a bucket sometimes
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:28.540]   for what we call celebration, that's finding appreciation in the world and life, connoisseurship
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.060]   or craftsmanship, et cetera.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:36.460]   All right, once you have these different areas, now I would suggest spend some time with each,
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.980]   but consecutively, not concurrently.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.020]   We're talking three to six weeks per each, all right, I'm going to spend this month just
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.620]   thinking about this area of my life and clean it up.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.580]   All I'm working on is this area of my life.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.180]   Get rid of some bad habits, put in place some new habits, if there's some one-time things
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:57.980]   to do, I'm going to buy this workout equipment, I'm going to join this gym, I'm going to get
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.740]   my guitar out and reworked again, whatever it is, one-time things, new habits, get rid
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.100]   of the old habits, just overhaul that part of your life in a sustainable way, then move
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.100]   on to the next bucket.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:12.220]   So this could take you the better part of half a year before you have sort of the different
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:18.780]   areas of your life that matter, at least all running in a reasonable way.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.540]   Now you can think about some larger goals in your personal life, some more ambitious
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.900]   or radical goals, and again, I would do these one at a time.
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.980]   This is what I'm working on this season.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.380]   In this part of my life, I have this like major new initiative.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.460]   That's what I'm working on, okay, and then once that's done, all right, what do I want
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.460]   to do next?
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:39.060]   I mean, this is a really busy part of my professional life, so I don't want any major personal goals,
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.040]   but when the summer comes, I'm going to take on another one.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.740]   Just have patience with this, Sam.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.380]   So this first thing is going to give you a good foundation for your life.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.700]   You're addressing the parts that are important, you're paying attention to them, and then
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:57.460]   in the short term, it might seem hopelessly slow that you're only working on one part
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.700]   of your life for the next month or two, and all these other parts of your life, you have
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:06.980]   these big ideas for radical plans, but let's zoom out to the scale of a couple of years.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.900]   Now suddenly, the amount of big goals in your personal life you accomplish is going to add
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.660]   up, and it's going to seem very impressive, and you're going to feel very deep.
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.900]   So you've just got to have some patience with this.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.940]   Don't try to do everything at the same time.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:24.940]   All right, this brings us to our final question, which is also our slow productivity corner
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.860]   question of the week.
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.860]   I don't know if Jesse's going to be able to add the music or not in post.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:36.820]   I hope he does, because I love the slow productivity corner theme music, and whether we have the
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.060]   music or not, I can remind you what the slow productivity corner is, is where I answer
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.220]   a question each week that's related to my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.900]   of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.140]   There we go.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:53.260]   Look, if you like especially the first part of this show, those ideas of these small things,
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.540]   you got to read Slow Productivity.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.220]   If you're a fan of the show, you need that book.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.680]   It's like the source guide for the book, so check that out wherever you buy books, Slow
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.680]   Productivity.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.900]   All right, what's our slow productivity corner question of the week?
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:10.060]   It's from Adan, who says, "I am currently re-reading your latest book, Slow Productivity.
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.060]   I love it.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.060]   A second read already.
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.580]   Way to go, Adan.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:18.660]   In the section Limit Daily Goals, you emphasize focusing on one task per workday.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:24.060]   This is a great idea, but it seems somewhat incongruent with time blocking, which seems
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:29.220]   to be useful for managing lots of different tasks within the same day."
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.660]   So Adan, I think this is a vocabulary issue.
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:38.180]   Limit Daily Goals is talking about the major initiatives that you work on or make progress
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:43.020]   on in a given day, and I'm arguing, if possible, just have one major initiative you're making
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.020]   progress on.
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.100]   So I'm working on this research paper.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.020]   I'm working on prepping this new hard class.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:54.060]   I'm working on my book and trying to make progress on a chapter from my book, and try
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.060]   to keep that the one thing.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.140]   Do you have a session for, and you can think about in the background and maybe return to
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:01.620]   it later in the day, have another deep work session on.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.700]   Outside of this one major thing, there'll be lots of other small tasks and obligations
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.900]   and things that have to go on.
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.900]   I have these meetings.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.140]   I got to follow up on this.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.100]   I got to get this paperwork submitted.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.540]   This is why you need time blocking.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.580]   The time blocking is going to help you make sense of where am I going to work on my major
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.580]   things?
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:17.620]   Where are the other things in the day?
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.460]   How am I going to get other small things that need to get done in the most optimal way possible?
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.800]   So most knowledge workers have a lot of things they have to do.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.060]   Time blocking helps you make sense of that.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.880]   The major things you work on, in an ideal world, though, you would limit that to one
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.880]   per day.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.380]   All right, Adan, thank you for that question.
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.180]   That is this week's Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.460]   All right, I'm gonna move on here.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.900]   I have a case study.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.020]   Case studies are where you, my listeners, send in examples of you using my advice in
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:47.060]   your actual lives so we can see what it looks like in practice.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:51.140]   Today's case study is anonymous, but it's interesting.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.140]   All right, here we go.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.220]   I'm reading now.
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:59.700]   I want to share how your podcast helped to remind me to build my career around my desired
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:00.700]   lifestyle.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:06.680]   When I first graduated from Juilliard and left New York, I moved in with my parents
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:12.060]   in the Portland area to save money while I hit the orchestral audition circuit.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:15.800]   I felt desperate to land an orchestra job as fast as possible, but the contrast of leaving
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.700]   New York for suburbia also made it incredibly apparent to me how much I wanted to get back
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:26.840]   to living in a dense, walkable city with good public transportation.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.660]   In those early months of desperation to advance my career and move out of my parents' house,
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:35.580]   I took auditions for big jobs in cities I would have hated to live in, like L.A., Cleveland,
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.860]   and Fort Worth.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.980]   After getting dangerously close to landing a couple of jobs in places I would have hated,
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.420]   I'm now living the dream in San Francisco as a freelancer and no longer feel like my
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:48.780]   entire life hinges on landing a big, high-status orchestra job.
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.340]   Last year, I even had the opportunity and flexibility to accept a contract with an orchestra
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:57.740]   in Auckland and lived in New Zealand for three months before returning to San Francisco.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:01.940]   I don't make as much money as if I had a full-time position with a major symphony, and in the
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:06.420]   eyes of the status hierarchy, I'm just a freelancer, but that's worth the benefit of having autonomy
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.220]   over where I live.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.420]   The weeks where I have holes in my calendar, I enjoy having an abundance of time to read
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.300]   and write and go for long walks and volunteer in my neighborhood.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.100]   Since moving here, I've been in finals for auditions for a couple of different full-time
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.540]   positions here in San Francisco, and there are more vacancies to be filled, so there
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:26.100]   is plenty of opportunity for upward career mobility without having to move so long as
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.100]   I'm willing to bide my time.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:32.340]   In practicing for auditions, I always get my best work done when applying the principles
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.900]   of deep work.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:42.260]   Well, I love this case study because it has a core idea that's part of my deep-life philosophy.
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:46.340]   So when trying to cultivate a deep life, an intentional life, a life lived on purpose,
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:52.140]   a life that's remarkable to yourself and other people, when trying to cultivate a deep life,
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:57.020]   a trap to avoid is the hope that the singular grand goal will change everything for the
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.020]   better.
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.980]   Now, this is a very common belief, especially in the American context.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:09.340]   This idea that if I want my life to be deep, I need a sufficiently ambitious and unambiguously
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:13.780]   impressive goal, and if I accomplish that goal, because that's a hard goal and it's
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.380]   very intentional and hard to do, my life will be intentional, and I'll enjoy it, and it'll
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.100]   be deep.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:24.140]   The problem with the grand goal approach is, as we just talked about in a prior question,
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:28.320]   is that there are multiple parts of your life that matter.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.100]   Singular grand goals tend to just focus on one part of your life, and in making one part
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:38.040]   of your life better, they can have unexpected consequences on the other parts of your life.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:45.580]   So in pursuing, for example, the goal of landing a high status orchestra job, you might really
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:48.740]   screw with, in this example, other parts of your life that are important, that have to
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:52.240]   do with where you live and the pace of your life.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.600]   So singular grand goals are worrisome.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:00.880]   So what we see here is working backwards from a general broad understanding of all the aspects
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.220]   that make the good life good for you.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:08.260]   So you're sort of, I call it your ideal lifestyle plan or ideal lifestyle narrative, and that
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:13.420]   leads to a much more subtle and complicated and nuanced approach with many more options
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.580]   for crafting a life that's going to be much more fulfilling.
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:23.500]   So because the case study here, the author of this case study, recognized location really
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.820]   mattered.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:30.260]   He did not go or accept the high status job in a city in which location would be really
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:34.100]   bad, but what he also did, because again, he's very plugged into, here's all the parts
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.100]   of my life that matter.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.900]   It allows you to much more flexibly be looking for opportunities to, how can I service more
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:40.900]   of these things that I care about?
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.500]   He cares about music, got this opportunity to go somewhere interesting, to play in an
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.720]   orchestra, but not to go to a location he doesn't like.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:52.500]   And also to have the flexibility of a freelancer so that like this other slower pace of life
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.780]   could still show himself and he could still have downtimes when he's reading, doing other
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.020]   types of things.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.020]   This is not something you sit about when you're in Juilliard and say, here's the obvious
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.020]   thing I want to do.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.680]   I want to be a freelance orchestra player in New Zealand.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:08.180]   You don't think about it from scratch, but when you work backwards from a broad lifestyle
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:12.780]   narrative, these are the type of subtle plans that come up that better play on all the different
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.020]   aspects of your life that matters.
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:18.860]   So it's a great case study of deep life planning in action.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.500]   All right, so that's all we got for today.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:25.460]   For questions, we've got a great final segment article I really want, I'm excited to react
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.460]   to.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.980]   However, I want to briefly mention another sponsor that makes the show possible.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:35.540]   I'm talking about our longtime friends at Element LMNT.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:40.840]   So the Element Zero Sugar Electrolyte Drink Mix is something I really use, especially
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:46.260]   after I exercise, especially after a long day of giving lectures or book touring, in
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:50.740]   which I'm dehydrated, because it gives me back those electrolytes I need with none of
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:51.740]   the junk.
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.780]   No sugar, no weird artificial flavors.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.260]   I put some element in my water after a workout.
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:00.620]   I put some element in my water on a long day of media tours.
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:06.360]   I put some element in my water in the morning when it's been a long day before and I'm feeling
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.360]   that sort of dehydration.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.700]   So I love Element.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:13.020]   I'm excited to announce they have this new product, Element Sparkling, which delivers
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:18.780]   the same zero sugar electrolyte formulation you already know and trust in a bold 16 ounce
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:22.260]   can of sparkling water.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:29.100]   So with Element Sparkling, you can now grab an already cold can of Element enhanced water
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.440]   straight from your fridge.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:37.300]   And once again, none of the junk, no sugar, no caffeine, just all the electrolytes that
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.300]   you need.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.620]   All right.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:46.300]   So this is becoming, they're rolling out Sparkling for more and more people right now.
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:50.980]   At the moment, if you're an Element insider, which you can find out by going to the Element
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:57.020]   website, you will get first access to Element Sparkling and then this will become more broadly
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:01.740]   available as time goes on.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:06.700]   The website you would want to use, I have that over here, is www.drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:11.700]   That's www.drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:17.380]   Other good news, you can get a free sample pack with any drink mix purchase you make
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.740]   at www.drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:22.780]   And again, if you're an Element insider, you'll have first access to Element Sparkling, a
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.740]   bold 16 ounce can of sparkling electrolyte water.
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:30.580]   So go to www.drinkelement.com/deep to find out more.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:36.300]   I also want to talk about our longtime friends at MyBodyTutor.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:41.260]   MyBodyTutor is the smartest solution I have seen to getting healthier.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:46.660]   And it's because it focuses on the issue that most people actually have putting their plans
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.060]   for increased health into action, which is consistency.
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:52.220]   It's not too hard to figure out what's a good way to eat and a bad way to eat.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.780]   It's hard to do it consistently.
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.460]   It's not hard to figure out what's a good exercise routine to do.
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.020]   It's doing that routine consistently.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:03.860]   MyBodyTutor gets around this problem by assigning you a 100% online coach.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.500]   This coach helps devise your plan with you.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.500]   What are we doing with your diet?
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.820]   What are we doing with exercise that matches your constraints, what you care about, what
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.940]   matches your life and personality?
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.100]   And then here's what's key, you check in with them every day.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.300]   That accountability is what gives you consistency.
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.100]   It also is what allows you to navigate obstacles.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.700]   Oh my God, there's a holiday coming up.
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.780]   I'm really worried about falling off of our diet.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.700]   You can talk to the coach and make an alternative plan.
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:27.700]   I'm going on vacation.
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:28.700]   I went to my gym.
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.900]   Like, great, here's what you're going to do on vacation.
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.380]   Let's help you have an alternative plan.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:36.380]   So you get all the benefits of having a dedicated coach without all the expense of having a
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:42.380]   physical nutritionist in your house or a personal trainer at the gym because it's 100% online.
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:49.820]   So it makes this type of high accountability, personalized training, much more affordable.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.260]   Now here's good news.
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:57.700]   If you go to my body tutor tutor.com to sign up and mention that deep question sent you,
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.740]   you'll get $50 off your first month.
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:05.780]   So just go to my body tutor.com and mention deep questions to get $50 off your first month.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.780]   All right, with that, let's return to our final segment.
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:14.260]   All right, so one of the things I like to do in the final segment of the show is react
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:18.420]   to interesting articles that I have seen around the internet.
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:21.980]   I have an article today that I really liked.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.720]   So I want to echo these points.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.260]   For those who are watching instead of just listening, I am going to attempt with trepidation
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:32.140]   to pull this up on my screen here.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:33.580]   So you should see this now.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:37.900]   The article is called "Countering Pushback to Limiting Social Media for Kids."
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.660]   It's written by the Washington Post columnist, Lena Nguyen.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:49.340]   Now what I like about this article is that Lena is talking back or addressing five of
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:55.500]   the most common complaints that people have about the renewed push that we should limit
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.780]   social media for kids.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:02.100]   So in other words, there's this growing push driven in large part by the popularization
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.660]   of research by John Haidt, that we should be careful about giving unrestricted access
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.180]   to social media and the internet to kids.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.940]   Don't just give a 13 year old a smartphone and say rock and roll, kids are kids, rock
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:11.940]   and roll.
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.060]   The data I believe is very clear that this is dangerous.
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:18.820]   Our best bet is to delay unrestricted access to the internet and social media in particular
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:23.860]   until kids are older, probably high school, post puberty, the safest age would probably
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:24.860]   be 16.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.580]   Okay, there's been a lot of pushback.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.300]   Any big trend is going to be pushback.
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:33.260]   I've heard a lot of this pushback over the years, but Lena I think in this article does
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:37.500]   a good job of responding to the most common pieces of pushback.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:43.580]   I'm going to go through her responses briefly, right now, because I think she's right on.
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:47.580]   All right, so I'm going to share this again on the screen.
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:54.260]   Let's start with Okay, first common complaint about limiting social media kids.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:55.980]   There are positive uses of social media.
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:00.020]   Here's Lena, some claim that because social media can offer educational resources and
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:05.320]   facilitate communication, LGBTQ plus and other youth who normally feel ostracized, are able
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:09.700]   to use the platforms to find community more easily, thus limiting social media could hurt
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.560]   especially vulnerable teens.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:16.980]   I hear this complaint or concern, I don't say complaint, but concern about social media
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:17.980]   restrictions.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:19.540]   I hear this concern a lot.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:22.900]   Here is Lena's response.
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.660]   This is ignoring the fact that without social media, young people seeking community have
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:30.860]   other online resources such as forums and support groups.
[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:34.600]   She's exactly right about this and these other online resources I actually think are much
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.620]   better than trying to be in an algorithmically driven attention economy echo chamber.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:42.200]   All right, here's objection number two.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:48.780]   Is parents being worried that they need them to keep in touch with their kids?
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:49.780]   Here's Lena's response.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:53.620]   Well, I understand the convenience of messaging your children in case pickup plans change.
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:58.660]   Surely this does not outweigh the substantial downside of kids being distracted from learning.
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:03.180]   There's ample proof that phones are distracting, dot, dot, dot.
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:06.860]   Just like the old days, if there's a true emergency, parents can pass messages by calling
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:07.860]   the front desk.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:12.100]   And for parents who must have a direct line to their kids, they can use dumb phones that
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.660]   don't have internet capability.
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:15.060]   I'm really on board with this.
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:18.220]   It seems like it's really throwing the baby out with the bathwater to have, you know,
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.180]   hey, I might need to access my kid directly.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.680]   In some scenario I've concocted, therefore they should have unrestricted access to social
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.740]   media.
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.740]   It's jumping a little bit too far.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:28.740]   All right.
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.540]   Let's look at the third objection that she addresses.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:36.120]   I'll put this back on the screen again, just for those, for visual variety's sake.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.860]   The third objection, kids will find a way around the controls.
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:41.580]   All right.
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:42.980]   Lena has the right response here.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:47.220]   It's like saying teenagers will drink and smoke anyway, so why bother trying to stop
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:48.220]   them?
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:49.700]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:53.120]   They will, so just don't give them a phone, don't put controls on it.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.300]   It's not a reason to stop it.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.300]   All right.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:56.940]   Complaint number four.
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:01.620]   It's too simplistic to say limiting social media will improve kids' social health.
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.980]   Lena goes on to elaborate this complaint.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:07.220]   The mental health crisis among young people has multiple causes of which social media
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.580]   is one.
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:11.660]   No one is saying that restricting social media use will solve the crisis.
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:12.660]   Oh, okay.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.860]   Then she says no one is saying that restricting social media use will solve this crisis because
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.220]   research shows that it will help, okay?
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:20.220]   Yes.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:26.580]   I think, again, to say there's other things that are causing mental health.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:30.960]   Just getting rid of social media is not going to solve all these problems doesn't then follow,
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:33.980]   so let's stop trying to do the social media piece.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.500]   That is a big piece of social media of mental health issues.
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:42.620]   It's one we can control, so let's do something about it.
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:47.980]   Perhaps this complaint takes a common form of complaint for a lot of issues, which is
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.660]   about messaging control.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:55.500]   Often there's this concern of if you focus too much, and a lot of different progressive
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:59.980]   issues, but if you focus too much on a concrete solution that could make progress, people
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.620]   will stop paying attention to these other things that are problems that we think are
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:03.620]   important.
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:09.340]   Often things require more systemic changes, and so there's a hesitancy to get concrete.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.380]   There's never a good reason to avoid concrete things that can help.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:18.020]   All right, let's go to the final, I'll load it back up here, the final objection that
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:20.220]   Lena responds to.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:24.060]   There isn't adequate data to prove social media worsens kids' health.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:27.460]   All right, here's Lena's response.
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:30.500]   While it's true that not all studies have found a strong correlation between social
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.540]   media and youth mental health issues, the data, in my view, is plenty strong enough.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:36.020]   I will add I agree.
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:39.620]   I have spent a lot of time with John Haidt and Gene Twenge's annotated bibliography
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:40.620]   on this research.
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:44.700]   I have watched over the years as the data gets more conclusive.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:48.380]   Research literatures are not about unanimity, they're about directions when they all begin
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:51.340]   to head towards the same point.
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:56.660]   Different experimental designs and studies all point towards the same conclusion.
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:00.380]   That's how you know the research literature is converging on something that's more likely
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:04.700]   true, and that's what we're seeing in the harms of social media debate.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.860]   In fact, Lena, she has a good way of saying this.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:11.820]   The question isn't, are we 100% sure of cause and effect, but rather, what is the harm of
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:14.540]   taking actions versus the harm of not doing so?
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.540]   Right?
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:20.580]   So unless you work for Apple or Meta, there's not a major harm to your kids not having these
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:21.580]   phones.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:24.900]   The biggest harm is maybe the perceived social complexity.
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.800]   That is super solvable.
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:31.200]   But the harm of having these things is becoming increasingly well documented.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.980]   To ignore, it's interesting, to ignore the data on this, it reminds me a lot of climate
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:35.980]   change denialism.
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:41.860]   Well, you know, there's this other thing I saw that's saying the islands aren't shrinking.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:46.780]   There's this other thing that it's more complicated about the changes in the temperature, and
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.860]   the climate change scientists have to say, "Look, the literature's this direction they
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:50.860]   pointed."
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:51.860]   Not like every article saying the same thing.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:56.260]   We're getting a lot of that same, I think, kids and social media denialism happening
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.260]   now.
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.580]   "Well, you know, what about this study over here and the potato study?"
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:04.020]   And you kind of have to trust the experts here who are looking at the preponderance
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:09.140]   of the evidence and seeing the research moving clearly, increasingly in this direction.
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.580]   So as Lena, that was a good column.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:15.300]   There's a link to it in the show notes, if you want to read it at the Washington Post.
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.500]   Those are common objections, and they all are relatively easily parried.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:23.660]   All right, so that's all the time we have for today's episode.
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.660]   Thank you, everyone, for listening.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:26.980]   Remember to help spread the word if you can.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:28.620]   I think we'll have Jesse back for next week.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:29.860]   He'll be done with vacation.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:32.180]   But thanks for putting up with the solo episode.
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.580]   We will see you or hear you next week, and until then, as always, stay deep.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:40.940]   Hey, if you like this video, I think you'll really like this one as well.
