[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480]   You know, obviously just winning it, bro.
[00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.540]   Like the champagne showers is so sick.
[00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.520]   - We was in the locker room.
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.360]   Yeah, people don't know.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.760]   We were in the locker room for hours on hours.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.080]   Like after we won the tip, you know,
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.240]   the celebrations on the court,
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.520]   then you move it to the locker room
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.920]   and we were in there just going crazy for hours.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.200]   It was like a club in there.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.040]   - It was, bro.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.920]   It was like a club in the locker room.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.360]   It was just drenched, like soaked in champagne.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.520]   Like the alcohol, it was like low-key burning my nostrils.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.240]   Like it was so like-- - In the air, bro.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.520]   - It was so thick.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.040]   Like the cigar smoke was so thick.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.520]   And then I was lit.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.360]   I was lit on the way back to the, like my place.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.440]   So I jumped out of the car.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.400]   And I was-- - I forgot about that, bro.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.600]   - I was through the streets.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.440]   - Yeah.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.720]   - And like people were double taking.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.880]   They were like, "Oh, shit, that's eight."
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.120]   Yo, I said, "Gee, really?"
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.280]   So it went from like 10 people to like 30 people
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.680]   to like 70 people.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.520]   We were in the streets.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760]   I'm like bodying people, like trying to get through.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.280]   Like a little kid walked up and I bodied him.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.280]   It was, it was, oh, man.
