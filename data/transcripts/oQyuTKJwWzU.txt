[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   It's not like you went into this other career that everyone knows, and it was very popular.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.680]   You started doing something that I think, even years later, is not popular.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.760]   So maybe give a little context to what it is to buy these businesses,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.600]   but what led you to start doing it?
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.280]   The secret is, I think, that the really, really wealthy have always bought these businesses.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.840]   I mean, richest guy in the world, owner of LVMH.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.960]   How did he get there? Did he start those companies? No, he bought them.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.880]   He bought a bunch of these companies, some of them basically out of bankruptcy, like Dior.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.960]   And he amassed a massive empire from the fact of buying, I mean, if we think about it,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.360]   really bag companies, right? Clothing companies.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.240]   They just have fancy labels on them that are highly overpriced.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.240]   And so that's how the richest guy in the world made his money.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.120]   The richest guy in India made his money through a conglomerate of businesses that he bought.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.760]   I mean, you look at a lot of the Fortune 500, and what you see, if you peel back the layers,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.640]   and you get rid of all of the heirs of Walmart, let's say, and the heirs of some of the large
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.600]   historical industries like Rockefellers, etc, you find that most of these people actually got there,
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.160]   not always from starting companies, but from buying.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.480]   The second most common is from buying companies.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.000]   And so in finance, private equity, we did that all day, right?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.240]   Like, I think that, oh, they're not going to like that I say this,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.640]   but I think people in private equity are brilliant in a way,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.040]   but it's slightly predatory. We are so sneaky that we make entrepreneurs
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.040]   think that putting their blood, sweat, and tears into companies is like the fun game.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.360]   This is what it means to be an innovator. This is what it means to be a creator
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.720]   and to build huge businesses. And then right about at the point
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.520]   where they want to slit their wrists, private equity swoops in and we say,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.560]   "Is it miserable running your company? Do you not want to do this anymore?
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.440]   Are you ready for something else? What if we give you a great offer?"
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.960]   And what the entrepreneur doesn't realize is that 0 to 1
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.080]   is the least profitable period of time in your business.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.840]   The most profitable period of time is actually the next stage,
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.600]   and then the stage where you continue to cash flow for a really long time on it.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.840]   And so we sort of scoop up these businesses at a period of time where
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.320]   the entrepreneur is in pain often, and then we cash flow on them forever.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.440]   And it's a gross generalization. That's not what all private equity firms do.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.040]   But once I realized that, I was like, "Wait a second."
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.760]   So we don't have to be clever enough to come up with an idea.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.000]   I'm not clever enough to come up with some crazy new billion-dollar idea for a company.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.800]   I don't know. But what I do know is how to look at
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.480]   what are expenses and what is income, aka P&L, and tell me if this business is making money or not.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.720]   And do I think that this business could continue to exist inside of the next 3 to 10 years,
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.560]   at which point I'll have all of my money back plus 3 to 5x, let's say.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.600]   I can't go figure that out. And because that's not that difficult,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.880]   why couldn't I do for myself what the big, huge guys do with LBOs,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.120]   leveraged buyouts, and all of that, but at a tiny scale with laundromats and car washes
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.040]   and things that cost $50,000 or $100,000, and then scaling up to a million and a five and a 10?
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.480]   It's the same game. It's just I'm playing it at a smaller level,
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.960]   at the mom and pop level, and what I call or what is called micro PE.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.080]   And that mom and pop level, I think when anyone listening is thinking,
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.040]   "Oh, wow, Cody goes and buys businesses. She must be a billionaire."
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.400]   It sounds like something you could actually make part of your investment portfolio
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.200]   at a very early stage in your wealth building journey and grow from there.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.840]   Would you say it's for anyone or who is buying a small business for?
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.800]   Yeah, the only people it isn't for are the lazy and the completely risk averse.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.080]   So if you want to do zero work, if you want to have zero risk, then don't buy businesses.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.320]   It's just not going to work out for you. And so if people are trying to sell you
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.600]   Airbnb arbitrage and you take no risk and you bring on these people and you make your millions,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.960]   okay, fine, do that. But I think for people that are willing to put in some work,
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.800]   there's no better way to make a return on it than having equity ownership that cash flows over time.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.440]   And the problem is, if you look at the S&P 500 or where people typically invest,
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.200]   what is a good dividend paying stock? 3% to maybe 9%. I mean, gosh, if you could get a 12%
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.880]   paying dividend stock, you're probably thinking that it's going to have some downside, right?
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.080]   Because that's too much. But in a small, boring business, you could have a return on your money
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.880]   of high double digits in a year. You could return all of your capital within a year.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.160]   And so I think it is for "anybody" that's willing to put in some work.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.120]   Now, the flip side to that is then people go, "Cody, sounds great, but I don't actually have
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.680]   millions." And I like to give examples like I bought a newsletter for $3,000
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.520]   just for shits and giggles. I wanted to put it into our media empire. I realized it didn't really
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.280]   fit. It wasn't going to grow the way that I wanted to. So I turned around and sold it,
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   I think a week later for $8,000. And that for me at the stage that I was at was not meaningful.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.400]   But for young Cody, like the Cody whose parents had no money, who used to bounce her checking
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.880]   account every weekend, who kind of thought her first job making $37,000 a year was amazing.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.320]   That was like, "I'm rich. I just made $5k in a week off of flipping somebody else's asset."
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.440]   That's fascinating. And so if you can start at that level, you can start to understand the
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.800]   bigger levels, the $100,000 deals, the million dollar deals, and the $100 million deals, I think.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.880]   Yeah. So one of the nice things... So yes, the return expectations of the stock market,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.440]   maybe 5%, 7%, 8%. But it's very easy to maintain a job and do that on the side because there's no
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.240]   work. Is the amount of work you need to go buy a boring business, a laundromat or something,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.960]   enough that you don't need to quit your job? Can it be a side hustle? Or how full time
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.600]   is doing this type of investing? I think it's very similar to rental
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.760]   properties, right? What sucks about getting rental properties? Well,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.920]   first you have to understand the market. You got to understand what's a good buy, what's a bad buy.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   Then you've got to actually get a mortgage. You've got to figure out what that looks like.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.520]   Then you have to figure out how to get somebody to rent your property out. But after you have
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.480]   that first period of understanding, you either Airbnb it out with some consistency or you get
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.720]   a property manager that manages it, right? And I think it's really similar to businesses.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.040]   Depending on the size and scale and type, you can have a business that's less active.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.600]   I try to not say passive because I think that's a fallacy overall, but that's less active.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.440]   And those businesses are, I think, all around. I use the example of car washes and laundromats
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.520]   and vending machines. Less because they're incredibly passive, but more because I call
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.080]   them the gateway drug businesses. So basically, you can get your little skin in the game. You
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.720]   can get your little first hit of being in business and being the owner. And then as you do that,
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.200]   you're like, "Oh, wait, this game is kind of fun. Maybe I'll do another one. I'm more capable than
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.360]   I thought." And I just think the world looks a lot better if we have more humans with skin in
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.120]   the game. And I think you can absolutely do it while you're still working.
