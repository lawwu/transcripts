[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, we talk often about glorifying God when things are hard.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Glorifying God in suffering and in loss and even in death.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Philippians 1:20 is a key text for us, one that we've addressed now over 30 times on the podcast, and for good reason.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   But what about glorifying God when things in life are good, and especially when your business is flourishing?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   That's our question today from a listener named Matt.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Hello, Pastor John. Thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   How should a Christian hedonist who is successful in business and a prominent leader speak in front of others about their story?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   It seems like many "Christian business leaders" make their success story all about themselves and then mask it all in a thin Christian wrapper.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   So what is the best way to authentically and humbly recognize a position of leadership and success, but to speak of it in a way that makes God look great?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I really appreciate this question, especially the way it's phrased there at the end, because I think that is the goal of everything in life, is to make God, Christ, look great.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   But I am going to push it back one step.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Matt asks about how a successful person in a leadership position may speak so as to make God look great.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And I'm going to push it back and say that almost everything hangs on how a successful person in a leadership position thinks and feels about his success in leadership.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I really do believe that if a person's thinking and feeling about his success and his work and his relationships and his leadership is deeply biblical and spiritual,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   then the speaking and all the more or less subtle forms of communication will take care of themselves.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So let me try to explain what I mean by right thinking and right feeling when it comes to one's success and leadership.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Five ways to think and I think five ways to feel about our life's achievements if God has given us success and given us, therefore, leadership.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Number one, so I'm talking about thinking first.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Number one, you will think rightly about the nature of what success is.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   You will not assume the world's definition of success, though there will be overlaps.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Essential to your definition of success will be your goals in life.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And these will not be identical with the world's goals.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Success is reaching goals.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   That's what success is.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And so choosing life goals is prior to seeking success.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Yours will include pleasing your Creator and the Lord of your life, getting in sync with his goals in the world.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   This will involve doing good for people in the hope of showing Christ's supreme worth.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   This will imply pervasive integrity, honesty, justice, generosity, the true good of clients and customers and employees and community.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Number two, you will think rightly about the fact that absolutely everything that makes this business flourish is a free and undeserved gift of God,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   including the raw materials, the skill of employees, the social conditions, the weather, the managerial successes and processes, and your own life, abilities, disciplines.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Acts 13.25 says, "God is not served by human hands as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything."
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   So life and breath and everything are a gift of God.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   You will think rightly about that.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Number three, you will think rightly about the relationship between hard work and divine blessing.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You will know God is decisive in all blessing, but you will not make the mistake of thinking that he does not use human means and human giftedness.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the Lord, Proverbs 21.31.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Both your preparations are essential, but God is decisive.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Or 1 Corinthians 15.10, "By the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that was with me."
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So yes, you worked. Yes, you are gifted. Yes, that's crucial.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   But all of it, all of it is owing to grace.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Number four, you will remember that God is sovereign and governs the world for his wise purposes.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   The smallest turn of affairs is ordered by God.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father, Matthew 10.29.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Every sparrow dies, and it dies by God's will.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   The lot is cast in the lap, every decision is from the Lord, Proverbs 16.33.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   This conviction is essential to right thinking about success.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And finally, number five on thinking.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   You will think rightly about the fact that as an undeserving sinner,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   not only is every good thing that comes to you a gift of God,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   it comes to you as his child undeserved and owing to the purchase he made by the blood of Christ.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Most Christians don't make this connection between the death of Christ
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   and the blessings they receive in this life.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   They think only in terms of forgiveness.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   But consider Romans 8.32.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?"
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   In other words, everything that comes to God's undeserving children
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   is owing to God's not sparing his son, but giving him up for us.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Every gift that we have from God in our business life, in our leadership,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   comes with a price tag, the blood of Jesus.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   We need to think rightly about that.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Now, what about feeling?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   If you're going to speak about your successful business and your leadership
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   in a way that makes Christ look great, you will need to be transformed
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   into the kind of person from the inside out who actually feels the greatness of Christ.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Not just knows it, but thinks it and feels it.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And all the things that go with it.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   For example, number one, you will feel thankful for everything.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Ephesians 5.20, "Give thanks always and for everything to God the Father
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   in the name of our Lord Jesus."
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   1 Thessalonians 5.18, "Give thanks in all circumstances,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So if you take those two texts together, it says,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   "For all things and in all things.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Few feelings are more winsome, humbling, other-oriented than thankfulness."
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   This cannot be pretended.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   It is a feeling.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   It is a feeling before it is words.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Do you really feel thankful?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   That will make a huge difference in how you talk.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Number two, you will feel not just thankful for all good things.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   You will feel undeserving, really undeserving.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   This is huge.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Do you?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Your understanding of sin will be existential in your business life.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   You will know that every morning that you wake up
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   and you don't wake up in hell is a good morning,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   an undeserved morning.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   If your doctrine of sin does not bring you to this point,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   you need to return to thinking rightly about the issue of sin
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   and go deeper into Scripture.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   We must pray.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   This doesn't come naturally.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   We must plead with God that the truth of our own fallen nature
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   as children of wrath, Ephesians 2, 3,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   children of wrath will cause us to feel undeserving
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   of every single good that comes to us.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Number three, you will feel amazed.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   This is the upside of undeserving
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   when grace rises to meet every degree of guilt we feel.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   The feelings of thankfulness and being undeserving
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   now overflow with amazement
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   as if a million-dollar check landed in your mailbox
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   every single morning.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Only better.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   The grace of God is amazing.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Number four, you will not feel proud but humble.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Not just think it, feel it.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   This makes all the difference.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   1 Corinthians 4, 7.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   What do you have that you did not receive?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And if you received it, why do you boast
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   as if you did not receive it?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Or here's James 4, 15.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   This is spoken directly to businessmen and women.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   "Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   and spend a year there and trade and make a profit.'
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Instead, you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   we will live and do this or that.'
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   As it is, you boast in your arrogance.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   All such boasting is evil."
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   In other words, it's arrogant to say,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   "I'm going downtown today to do some business."
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   You don't know if you're going to make it downtown.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   The sovereignty of God and the grace of God
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   over every detail of your lives, James says,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   cancels boasting, causes us to feel humble,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   and finally, number five,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   you will feel an overflowing joy
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   that inclines you to love other people
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   and be generous with them.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   2 Corinthians 8, verse 2.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   "In a severe test of affliction,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   their abundance of joy
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   overflowed with a wealth of generosity."
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   So if you have these five aspects of right thinking
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   and these five aspects of right feeling
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   about your success and leadership,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   there will be an overflow of right speaking
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   to make Christ look great.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Love this.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   So much of this episode resonates with me as an author, too,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   writing from the overflow.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   And I think this is the first time in an APJ episode
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   we've applied James 4, 13 to 16 to a business context.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I was just looking that up, and I think that's true.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It's been applied in episodes on mortality, of course,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   but not business.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Interesting to bring it into a commercial context
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   because of how loaded it is with implications
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   for business leaders.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   You can ask a question of your own,

[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Well, Pastor John is a Christian.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   That's no secret.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   But how was he converted?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   When was he converted?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Where was he converted?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   All questions you have wanted to know,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   and we'll get some answers to those questions next time.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
