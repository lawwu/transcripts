[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.240]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.680]   knowledge, skills, insight and encouragement.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.640]   You need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.880]   financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.560]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.200]   I am your host.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.880]   And today on the show, I want to talk to you about some skills that you can develop
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.160]   that will help you in life, in business and in your finances, but these skills
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.280]   are not hard skills, they're not math skills, and we're not going to talk about
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.560]   a specific financial planning tactic.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.800]   Rather, these are soft skills, things that you can use and develop to enhance
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.040]   your career and enhance in the longterm, the outcome that you gain from your work.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.480]   I generally tend to keep Radical Personal Finance free of current events.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.760]   Unless they are somehow related to some impending financial news that you need
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.640]   to know, and of course, from time to time, there's some of that, or unless
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.440]   there are valuable lessons in it.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.040]   And today we're going to talk about networking and developing influence
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.880]   and how it can help your wealth.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.880]   But I was inspired to do this based upon recent news events.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.200]   As I record this episode and release it on Monday, September 30, 2019, there
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.360]   was quite the brouhaha in the United States over the alleged actions of
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.680]   President Trump, as well as the alleged actions of former President Joe Biden.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.280]   The details of that are not material to our conversation, except as it relates
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:51.920]   to the income that politicians can gain from their involvement in politics.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.680]   My interest is specifically in the story of the son of former
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.920]   President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.480]   And that story is part of the fact pattern over which is being vigorously
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:13.000]   debated in the United States over what the son, Hunter Biden, was doing in his work.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.600]   Now for context, let me just reference a USA Today newspaper article
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.800]   from October 17, 2014, headline, "Biden's Son Fails Drug Test."
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.240]   Is discharged from Navy.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.800]   Hunter Biden, the youngest son of Vice President Joe Biden, has been kicked
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.080]   out of the military after testing positive for cocaine.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.600]   Two people familiar with the matter said Thursday.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.840]   The younger son of Vice President Joe Biden failed a drug test for cocaine
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.040]   a month after his commissioning last year into the Navy Reserve and was discharged.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.840]   Hunter Biden, an ensign, had been selected for commission as a reserve
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.520]   officer through the direct commission officer program in 2012, according
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.800]   to Commander Ryan Perry, a Navy spokesman.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.320]   He was commissioned into the Navy Reserve Unit for Navy Public Affairs
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.720]   Support Element East in Norfolk, Virginia.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.400]   Biden, who had no prior military experience, was one of six officers
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.840]   commissioned nationally into the Navy Reserve Public Affairs Division.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.040]   Skipping one paragraph of platitudes, the incident, two paragraphs, Biden,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.960]   44, was discharged from the Navy Reserve in February.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.640]   He has worked as a lawyer, lobbyist, and managing partner at the investment
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.080]   firm Rosemont Seneca Partners in Washington.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.320]   He was hired in May to join the board of Burisma Holdings, Ukraine's largest
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.920]   private oil and gas producer, and be in charge of its legal department.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.240]   A spokeswoman for the vice president declined to comment.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.440]   That was from 2014.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.800]   And the little piece of news that more people today have become aware of,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.200]   than they were in 2014, 2015, is that Hunter Biden was allegedly, as far as
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.680]   I know, this is not a disputed fact.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.280]   I guess I should say he was being paid about a salary of $50,000 per month
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.040]   or $600,000 per year in his work for the Ukrainian oil and gas company.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.120]   Now, the facts of this case can be disputed depending on
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.560]   what perspective you have.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.080]   Different people look at it and see different things.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.560]   I simply want to point to the bare facts.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.200]   The bare facts are that a man was discharged.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.680]   It was called an administrative discharge.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.040]   Some would allege it's a dishonorable discharge, but the man was discharged
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.800]   with something other than honorable discharge from the United States Navy
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.400]   out of a position that he was recently ushered into, which was fairly special.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.120]   It wasn't the typical thing you think up with the military, go to
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.240]   bootcamp and work your way up.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.200]   It was just come on in here and work as a lawyer in this spokes department.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.640]   A public affairs kind of thing.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.280]   Discharged from that for drug use and yet was immediately caught by the
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.880]   safety net of a $600,000 annual salary.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:05.040]   Now, if you think about that, that's a fairly unusual experience for most people
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.880]   who go through a similar fact pattern.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.240]   I had a good friend of mine, similar in age, served in the Navy.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.400]   In his case, it was a more traditional role.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.240]   The lower end role was discharged from the Navy for among other things, drug use.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.680]   And his life did not go very well after that Navy discharge.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.320]   He was not ushered into a $600,000 per year job immediately following a less
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.200]   than honorable discharge from the US Navy.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.080]   There are many people that you know, and that I know whose lives have been
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:49.080]   turned up upside down for far less than being caught in the Navy using cocaine.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.520]   And many of those people, unfortunately never recover from such a thing
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.080]   and they never recover financially.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.640]   So the question is this, what's the difference between Hunter Biden's
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.560]   experience and my friend's experience?
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.960]   The basic facts were similar.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:14.600]   Discharged from the Navy after drug possession and drug use, but the ending
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.800]   result and the luxury of that result was extremely different.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.160]   In the one case, my friend ended up barely getting a job working in the
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.760]   kitchen of a pizza hut as compared to Hunter Biden, immediately ushering,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.800]   being ushered into a job making $600,000 per year.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.960]   Well, there are a lot of things we can discuss.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.320]   We can discuss the rules that apply to the elites versus the rules that apply
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.720]   to those who are not part of the elite.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.760]   There's some other directions we could go, but I just, we want to
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.360]   focus on the power of a network and try to talk to you about how you may be
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.320]   able to build this for yourself while hopefully not being involved
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.920]   in the seedy side of politics.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   We can see from politics that if somebody is able to build a network
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.760]   and develop influence, they can leverage that influence into financial gain.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.440]   It is very hard to find in the United States of America, probably in most
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.160]   countries, it is very hard to find a politician who achieves prominence
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:23.760]   and notoriety, who is not financially set for life through a variety of means.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.280]   Now that can be the flat out illegal thing of directly selling influence.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:37.040]   It can be the obvious immoral thing of just simply adjusting things based
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.640]   upon those who lobby, but not illegal, based upon those who make campaign
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.200]   contributions to you, et cetera.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.480]   Or it can be just softer things.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.280]   Have you developed access and influence?
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.880]   And so you leave office and go and join the board of this company and generate
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.240]   your salary there through your boardship director and just simply make some
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.680]   introductions, things like that.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.880]   You can talk about insider trading and there are lots of ways that you can
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.760]   profit off of politics, but it's very hard to find a prominent politician who
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:12.120]   does not become very wealthy during and after their time in political service.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.240]   Now they do exist.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.600]   It's hard to find on a presidential level.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.680]   I think the last president who didn't abuse their position was probably
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.920]   Harry Truman, famously avoided the limelight.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.280]   But at this point, being a president or former president is pretty much a
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:33.120]   ticket to a very high income post-presidency, six-figure speeches and beyond.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.120]   President Obama famously got, I think, a $65 million book advance
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.280]   for his most recent book.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.360]   President Bush has been more quiet, but still gives six-figure speeches.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.920]   Former President Bill Clinton gave a series of speech, about a dozen or 15
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.040]   speeches at about $500,000 each.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.440]   So the public speaking circuit is very profitable.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.960]   The writing circuit is very profitable.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.840]   But this also extends to the children of former politicians.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.880]   We see the example from Hunter Biden.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.360]   You can think back and Chelsea Clinton, for example, a few years ago was announced
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.320]   as being a board member on Expedia.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.680]   Now think about this, think about what you know of Chelsea Clinton and ask
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.840]   yourself, what does Chelsea Clinton bring to the board of Expedia?
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.040]   Now, I don't know.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.200]   I don't know what she's done.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.040]   I don't know what she studied.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.360]   Maybe she's become a tremendously competent businesswoman and is really
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.680]   amazing, but it was reportedly that reported that they're paying her $300,000
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.680]   a year to sit on the board of Expedia.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.320]   That's not an insubstantial salary for someone to earn when that person is at
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.800]   least not publicly known for being an incredibly bright businesswoman who's
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.320]   able to turn company profits around.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:52.320]   Going back prior to that Expedia announcement, Chelsea Clinton was brought
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.240]   on with a job with NBC as a special part-time correspondent and was
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.520]   reportedly paid $600,000 per year for her work there to produce some
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.240]   occasional feel good news stories.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.280]   Probably a normal compensation was, if you go back to the news stories at that
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.920]   time, normal compensation, more like a hundred to $200,000.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.400]   Well, she was paid $600,000 per year.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.080]   Last we pick on the Clintons too much, the Bushes, similar, similar things.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.880]   The daughter of former president George W.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:25.040]   Bush, Jenna Bush Hager reportedly paid $4 million for her work in the TV business.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.400]   Her sister $4 million per year for her sister, Barbara Pierce Bush, a little
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.360]   bit more private, less in the public eye, but still extremely effective
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.640]   and productive currently reportedly.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.760]   Of course, you never know how these things are, are because of the public.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.880]   There's not reporting requirements, individual private people's net worth,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.760]   but reportedly has a net worth of something like $5 million
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.720]   at this point as a young woman.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.680]   So she's been able to profit off of that.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.640]   She gives keynote speeches and famously a few years ago, headlined for planned
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.080]   parenthood at a keynote keynote speech event there.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.480]   And so I don't know what she was paid for that.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.960]   I don't know if anyone has ever to able to find out those details.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.720]   I don't know if she did a pro bono, but it's not unusual for someone in that
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.040]   position to make several tens of thousands of dollars for such an event.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.440]   And, you know, former president Obama's children are still young, but they will,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.720]   as they go through their elite college path and whatnot, they will emerge and
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.000]   they will be well taken care of for their careers.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.840]   And of course, president Trump's children, the same thing
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.720]   will happen in the coming years.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.160]   So it's extremely obvious for presidents and it applies to lesser
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.800]   degrees to other people as well.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.840]   So here's let's move past the seedy side.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.040]   Cause I have no interest in politics.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.000]   I have no interest in getting you to go into politics.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.040]   I, it is important for me to cover the show is called radical personal finance.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.320]   And yes, you could become a, a multimillionaire and assure the future
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.920]   of your children by going into politics, but you often will have to sell your soul.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.720]   Maybe there's a few people who don't sell their souls, but
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.520]   you will have to sell your soul.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.760]   It's a seedy, disgusting business.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.200]   And what does it profit a man if he gained the whole world
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.120]   and yet forfeit his own soul?
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.840]   I see nothing.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.800]   But are there lessons that you can learn from that and apply to your own life?
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.960]   And my answer is yes, because at the end of the day, developing social capital
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.720]   as one of the forms of capital to develop is not in and of itself wrong.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.080]   It's not in and of itself immoral.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.680]   In fact, it's extremely important.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:25.360]   And essentially what politicians do is simply on a large level, what you and
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.960]   I should do in our local communities.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.760]   The difference is of course, that politicians do it through the levers
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.040]   of the government, which has a monopoly on force.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.080]   You and I have to do it and should choose to do it by being those who are committed
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.880]   to nonviolence and non-coercion.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:45.640]   You and I do it through persuasion and influence rather than force.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.760]   I want to talk to you about how you can develop skills
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.760]   of networking and influence.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:56.440]   If there are crimes that are developed or that are actually committed, I don't
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.280]   know if there are or not by politicians.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.320]   Usually it's a matter of leveraging influence.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.880]   And sometimes that's a direct payment for services.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.040]   You made this payment and funneled the money through to me in some
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.960]   way that passes the smell test.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.200]   And then we find over here that this thing happened that treated you well.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.480]   And this happens every day.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.240]   All big major companies have their lobbyists on Capitol Hill.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.880]   They're constantly involved in saying, how can we tilt the laws in our favor?
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.440]   And wealthy people, et cetera, do exactly the same thing.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.480]   But from your and my perspective, the right way to do this is to think
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.760]   about how can I be of service to the people that I serve?
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.200]   How can I help them?
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.080]   And one of the ways that you can help them is by developing influence, by
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.200]   developing the way to serve people so that it creates loyalty among your
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.720]   customers and your clients so that in helping them in the long run, you'll
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.680]   be able to help yourself.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.880]   Zig Ziglar's old saw, you can have everything in life that you want.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.960]   If you just help enough, other people get what they want.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.600]   I myself am trying to get everything I want in my life by helping you
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.560]   get what you want in your life.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.960]   I'm trying to build financial freedom and impact and influence for myself
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.320]   by helping you to do that for yourself.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.280]   So at the end of the day, we're all doing about the same thing.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.240]   When most people go into networking, they think of networking in terms of
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.680]   this kind of glad-handed go into an event, you know, some kind of local
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.080]   chamber of commerce event, how are you?
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.600]   Who are you?
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.280]   Kind of a smarmy thing.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.800]   Now, it's not that that stuff isn't helpful.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.200]   Of course, smarmy-ness is not.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.760]   My experience though has been that people who are really good in that
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.280]   context aren't actually smarmy.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.880]   But rather good networking goes beyond and it goes to the point of service.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.160]   How do you serve people?
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.440]   And so if we take the lesson of saying, if I can develop influence for myself
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.320]   and for my family, that I can set the safety net under myself and my children
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:06.840]   so that if my child gets discharged from the Navy for cocaine possession,
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.920]   they're quickly ushered into a $600,000 per year job, that's a really useful
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.680]   thing as a parent to have as a backup plan if you're trying to help your child
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.200]   versus they're going to go and become a cook in a Pizza Hut kitchen.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.360]   That's going to be the difference based upon how effectively you develop
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.160]   your networking skills or even for yourself.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.800]   How can you set things up so that if you appear on the front page of a
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.240]   newspaper for some scandalous thing that you've done, and then some months
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.600]   later, you're trying to put your life back together, you need a job.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.880]   Can you pick up the phone and get yourself a job?
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.640]   Now, to give you some practical advice, I want to read you a few pages from
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.200]   the introduction of a book that influenced me deeply years ago called
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.440]   Networking with the Affluent and Their Advisors.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.040]   This book was a book written by Thomas Stanley, Dr.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.080]   Thomas Stanley, most famously the co-author of The Millionaire Next Door,
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.080]   and then associated follow on books.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.080]   But he wrote a series of books before The Millionaire Next Door
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.280]   that are very poorly known.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.800]   One was called Networking with the Affluent, one was called Selling to
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.400]   the Affluent, and one was called Marketing to the Affluent.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.880]   But when I was a young financial advisor, I was studying this topic because,
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.000]   of course, if you're a financial advisor, you want to work with the affluent.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.600]   And the workbook, and I didn't know, I wasn't a good networker.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.480]   I didn't know how to do it.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.000]   I never liked the how are you, who are you's at the cocktail parties.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.240]   It just wasn't my scene.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.360]   And I always thought there's got to be a better way.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.280]   And so this book was particularly helpful to me.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.360]   And I want to share a few pages from the introduction because it lays out
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.000]   the basic premise of the book, and there are things that you can add to your
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.960]   own life to be one who helps and serves the affluent, and there are things
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.080]   that you can do to help and serve other people that will generate
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.320]   additional influence for you.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.840]   In the book, he spends a lot of time, Stanley spends a lot of time talking
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:17:02.160]   about the things that the affluent value most and how to then engage with those.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.560]   But he lays out basically eight different types of networking to do.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:13.440]   And he covers these each in long chapters with long lists of examples, et cetera.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:19.800]   But in the first, in the introduction, he talks about the basic types of
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.760]   fate or faces he calls them of people who help the affluent and how
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.040]   that helps their own business.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:31.080]   I'm going to read you these descriptions of the eight faces of those who
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.080]   effectively network with the affluent.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.440]   And as I'm reading them, I want you to think about your life
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.680]   with those that you serve.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:43.560]   My job is to serve you, but your job is to serve your customers and think about
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.080]   how you can do these more effectively with your customers, the people that
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.720]   depend on you so that you could develop political influence in your community
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.360]   so that you could develop social capital in your community so that you could
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.880]   develop that social safety net, which will serve you and your children
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.560]   well in your time of need.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.440]   And then at the end, if you find this interesting, I think you should pick
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.520]   up a copy of Dr.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.920]   Stanley's book, in my opinion, is probably his least appreciated book.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.360]   Um, but one of the most useful, the eight faces of networking.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.080]   Networkers can influence the influential in eight ways.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.160]   This book discusses these eight faces or dimensions underlying influence networks.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.880]   The following chapters contain case studies of some of
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.760]   America's top rated networkers.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.600]   Most of these networkers employ more than one of the eight dimensions.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.080]   However, each is classified according to the major dimension of
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   influence that he or she utilizes.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.440]   The extraordinary networker described in chapter eight actually
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.120]   employs all eight dimensions.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.960]   However, his major dimension of influence is that of someone who
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.840]   saves considerable money for clients and prospective clients.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.640]   He does so by negotiating the purchase of expensive
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.480]   automobiles and homes for them.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.720]   Face one, the talent scout.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.640]   Most affluent individuals are either successful self-employed business
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.880]   owners or self-employed professionals.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.960]   They are in constant search of quality suppliers.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.040]   Now consider for a moment, the number of quality suppliers that sales and
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.080]   marketing professionals prospect, productive networkers come into contact
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.720]   with hundreds, even thousands of suppliers each year, why not act as a
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.120]   talent scout for clients and prospects?
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.440]   They will appreciate the efforts of networkers who play this role.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.760]   However, truly enlightened networkers focus their energies when playing this role.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.600]   They provide talent scout services to people who influence large
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.280]   numbers of affluent prospects.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.040]   By targeting in this way, a young sales professional recently gained the
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.520]   endorsement of a millionaire who headed an important trade association.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.640]   This sales professional, a financial consultant successfully targeted
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.440]   important opinion leaders who represented the most affluent
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.280]   industries within his trade area.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.640]   How is this accomplished?
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.560]   He established an industry advisory council that provided top notch speakers
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.880]   to these affluent affinity groups, free of charge, the council also made
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.320]   available the names of top ranked suppliers and industry experts to
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.920]   members of the trade association.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.320]   The experts he provided included leaders in such fields as advertising,
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.800]   estate planning, commercial real estate, marketing, public relations, production
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.000]   management, and materials procurement.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.600]   How was this sales professional rewarded for referring these top
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.200]   suppliers to industry leaders and other prospects and clients?
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.880]   His revenue was enhanced.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.920]   The main topic of chapter three, the suppliers felt indebted to him
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.800]   and many of them became his clients.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.280]   Within 14 months, he was no longer a six hour per day, cold
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.800]   calling low level producer.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.680]   He is now viewed as a talent scout, an investment expert by members of one of
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.920]   the most affluent affinity groups in America.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.080]   Most recently, he was asked to manage the investments of a trade association that
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.040]   represents thousands of affluent members.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.800]   Chapter two contains several important concepts regarding the way in which a
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.320]   high grade networker generated significant sales volume via the talent scout strategy.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.840]   In addition, a portion of chapter eight details the talent scout activities
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.600]   of the ace of aces of networking.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.160]   His list of talent suppliers has 80 categories.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.320]   So phase one is the talent scout.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.520]   And I'll interrupt the reading to simply say that if you can be one who helps
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.480]   other people find the people and resources that they need, you will generate for
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.200]   yourself political influence and you can do it in a nonviolent, non-coercive way.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.120]   Phase two, the revenue enhancer.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.160]   What is the most powerful method of influencing those who influence
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.880]   many other affluent prospects?
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.920]   As a general rule, it is the discussion of networking called revenue enhancement.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.840]   Ask most successful business owners, professionals, and other self-employed
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.320]   prospects this simple question.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.960]   What is your number one need?
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.600]   Most will answer revenue enhancement.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.680]   Given a choice, would these prospects prefer to patronize a supplier who
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.720]   provides only a core product or service?
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.760]   That is the basic or conventional offering or one who provides more than the core?
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.600]   Dull, normal truck dealers offer only trucks.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.440]   Unenlightened accountants offer only accounting services.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.160]   Run-of-the-mill attorneys offer only legal advice and so on.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.840]   Truly gifted suppliers, however, offer more than the core.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.280]   For instance, consider the truck dealer who goes out of his way to find
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.240]   business and customers for his clients.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.400]   Also note the business generated by Father Fred, a construction equipment
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.440]   dealer who lives by the networkers' creed.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.480]   You can't sell construction equipment to contractors who have no contracts.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.080]   Father Fred is a master of networking via the revenue enhancement mode.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.200]   This strategy accounts for a major portion of his own revenue.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   Prospects have sought him out.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.760]   Influential clients have gone out of their way to refer business to him.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.680]   Why?
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.240]   Because he enhanced their revenue.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   He is in constant contact with major contractors who employ his customers.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.160]   Most of Father Fred's customers are subcontractors.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.760]   On their behalf, he debriefs contractors about their needs for subcontractors.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.840]   Thus, Father Fred creates his own demand.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.600]   He enhances the demand for his clients' offerings.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.880]   In turn, the enhanced demand for those offerings enhances the demand for
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.440]   Father Fred's construction equipment.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.000]   There are thousands of equipment dealers in America, but there
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.720]   are only a few Father Freds.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.320]   If you needed equipment, what type of dealer would you seek?
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.800]   Revenue enhancement is not limited to the construction industry.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.400]   Look at the case of a truly enlightened auto dealer in Texas.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.640]   To target top sales professionals from the investment industry, he
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.720]   networked with a regional sales manager from a brokerage firm.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.160]   The sales manager referred his top producers to the auto dealer.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:37.960]   Why?
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.520]   Because the auto dealer enhanced the sales manager's revenue.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.640]   The auto dealer not only referred his top suppliers to the sales manager,
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.760]   he also sent the sales manager the names of people who had recently been awarded
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.160]   major construction contracts in Texas.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.120]   Almost all of these winners had bids in the over $1 million category.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.720]   How did the auto dealer obtain this information?
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.960]   He once asked a euphoric customer why the customer had just purchased
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.200]   a top of the line model.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.760]   The answer was quite simple.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.040]   I just won a major construction contract.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.360]   He then asked the customer another question.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.720]   Auto dealer.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.520]   Sir, is there any publication that lists all of the people in your business
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.240]   who won construction contracts?
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.280]   Customer.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.360]   Why, yes.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:26.080]   Read the big one section in the weekly publication called the Texas Contractor.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.120]   It lists a dozen or more big winners each week.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.680]   Not far from the city where this took place, another revenue enhancing
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.360]   networker, a young financial consultant, recently landed a $15 million account.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.400]   His client was the owner of a successful welding company.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.040]   When this financial consultant first visited the owner, what did he say?
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.280]   Two of my most important clients own hundreds of oil drilling platforms.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.480]   They're looking for a welding company to service their platforms.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.040]   I would like to put you in touch with them.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.040]   Both owners of oil drilling platforms did in fact hire the welding company.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.600]   And in turn, via the revenue enhancement strategy, the owner of the welding
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.320]   company opened a major account with the financial consultant.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.880]   In another case of revenue enhancement, a young sales professional enhanced
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.160]   the business of major suppliers to the food industry.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.280]   These suppliers included leading industry experts on such matters as advertising,
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.200]   public relations, marketing, business valuation, estate planning, production,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.480]   planning, and commercial real estate.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.320]   How did the sales professional identify these experts?
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.080]   They all published articles in the top food industry trade journals.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.760]   When the sales professional in this case first prospected owners of food
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.240]   companies, they often said, at the moment, I don't need what you're selling.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.120]   His response was quite simple.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.920]   What are your most pressing needs?
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.880]   If the prospect stated that he needed an advertising agent, the sales
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.240]   professional made a referral to the advertising agent who was
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.440]   published in the trade journal.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.000]   The advertising agent reciprocated by opening an investment account with
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.160]   the sales professional and by referring his food industry clients
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.240]   to the sales professional.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.640]   The top networker who employs a revenue enhancing strategies once stated,
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.520]   the most important thing you can do to convert a prospect into a client is to
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.000]   say, give me a stack of your business cards.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.200]   I have many clients who are likely to buy from you.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.440]   Revenue enhancing methods are simple, logical, and highly productive.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.840]   Why then do sales professionals use them so infrequently?
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.320]   Because these professionals lack empathy for the real needs of prospects.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.920]   Fortunately, that empathy can be acquired.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.040]   Revenue enhancement is the central topic of chapter three.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.320]   Phase three, the advocate.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.840]   The affluent in America typically agree with the following statement.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.640]   Although thousands of well-qualified accountants, attorneys, architects,
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.160]   financial consultants, bankers, and other types of professionals can
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.280]   provide basic services, few of these professionals have demonstrated any
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.080]   interest in supporting the causes that are really important to me.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.600]   The two service professionals described in this section are skilled in
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.280]   their respective disciplines, however, their success in generating endorsements
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.560]   from key patronage opinion leaders is explained not only by their core skills,
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.920]   but also by their advocacy of the needs and rights of their targeted audiences.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.880]   Mr.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.160]   Allen is a successful financial consultant.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.600]   He helps clients and prospective clients by providing them with quality financial
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.720]   advice and investment management services, but he also plays the role of advocate.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.320]   Take a recent situation as an example.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.400]   One of Mr.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.640]   Allen's best clients is a timber grower.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.560]   This client owns thousands of acres of high grade forest and periodically
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.120]   harvests timber from various tracts, but the client's livelihood is being threatened.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.800]   Mr.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.480]   Allen discovered this because he is a strategic reader of the editorial
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.080]   sections of both local and national newspapers.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.840]   Recently, he read a letter to the editor of his metropolitan newspaper that proposed
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.960]   banning the harvesting of timber in the state.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.080]   This completely one-sided letter was written by an advocate of woodpeckers
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.680]   rights, the letter stated that keeping woodpeckers in the forests was of more
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.520]   importance than the needs of landowners.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.480]   In a letter to the editor of the same newspaper, Mr.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   Allen advocated a more balanced approach to the issue.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.960]   He pointed out that earning a living was a basic democratic right and that
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.000]   "not even timber people are exempt from having to feed and clothe their children."
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.520]   Mr.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:14.280]   Allen mailed copies of his letter to all the timber growers and trade association
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.200]   officers listed in "Who's Who in Timber" and to selected lawmakers and clients.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.160]   He attached this note to each copy that he mailed to members of the timber industry.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.080]   "I trust the enclosed letter will help your cause.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.560]   If I can be of any further assistance to you and your colleagues, please let me know.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.320]   I'm a strong supporter of the rights of business owners.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.520]   Any comments or suggestions will be appreciated.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.200]   Please call or write me."
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.680]   Several timber growers called Mr.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.480]   Allen to thank him for his kind support.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.240]   All of the others took his telephone call immediately or returned
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.440]   the call within a day or two.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.680]   Several eventually became his clients.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   A steady stream of prospective clients has been referred to him by the timber
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.040]   growers listed in "Who's Who in Timber."
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.360]   How many other professionals who service the members of "Who's Who in Timber"
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.640]   played the role of advocate?
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.840]   According to Mr.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.000]   Allen, the answer is zero.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And only Mr.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.600]   Allen reaped the benefits that advocates receive.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.640]   He has been endorsed as an outstanding financial advisor and asset manager
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.360]   by an increasing number of industry opinion leaders.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.360]   Mr.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.880]   John is a landscaper whose case history is similar to Mr.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.360]   Allen's.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.480]   Although only in his mid twenties, Mr.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.160]   John is already an accomplished networker and marketer of his services.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.160]   As an example of his high level of networking, consider his recent role
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.200]   as an advocate of the rights and freedoms of senior citizens.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.880]   During a recent visit to his grandfather, Mr.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.720]   John learned that his grandfather was quite upset by an article that
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.280]   had appeared in the local newspaper.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.160]   The article argued that seniors were unable to operate motor vehicles
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.200]   safely and suggested that they be required to take a driver's test every year.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.760]   Yet the author of the article provided no hard statistical evidence
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.120]   to support his contentions.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.680]   On behalf of his grandfather and all the other seniors who operated
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.600]   motor vehicles in the community, Mr.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.680]   John wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.760]   The letter advocated the right of seniors to retain their driving
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.200]   privileges and provided statistical evidence documenting the ability of
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.520]   seniors to drive in a safe and prudent manner.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.920]   That evidence was gathered and disseminated to seniors by the
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.960]   state's mature citizens association.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.880]   Mr.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.680]   John sent copies of his letter to all of the senior citizens among his
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.360]   clients and closed with the letter was this note, most of my clients are seniors.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.880]   I really appreciate your business and hope that the enclosed
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.200]   letter will help your cause.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   A copy of Mr.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.880]   John's letter was placed in his firm's new business development dossier,
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.440]   also known as a promotional packet.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.960]   The letter was also published in three area based newsletters to
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.880]   which seniors subscribed Mr.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.800]   John's trade areas in the center of affluent retirement communities.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.760]   And when Mr.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.520]   John's firm submits a written proposal to the managers of these communities,
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.800]   it encloses something that none of his competitors can match.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.480]   Mr.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.080]   John's letter to the editor, which documents his role as an advocate
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.840]   of the causes of senior citizens.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.760]   Mr.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.160]   John also provides free landscaping services to two rest homes
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.040]   for underprivileged senior citizens.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.440]   This contribution is noted in his dossier.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.200]   Mr.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.480]   John is quite frank about his view of landscapers.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.160]   He will tell you that scores of qualified landscapers within his trade
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   area are skilled in the development and decorative planting of gardens and grounds.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.880]   Beyond this core service, however, only Mr.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.240]   John distinguishes himself as an advocate of his target market.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.400]   Chapter four details several examples of the advocacy role
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.240]   played by innovative networkers.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.520]   Phase four, the mentor.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.680]   Many top grade networkers play the role of mentor for clients.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.680]   But only a much smaller number have been clever enough to play that
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.880]   role for the entire membership of an affluent affinity group.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.840]   Bart Carr is one of them.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.280]   He is the mentor to the members of several dental societies.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:45.960]   Mr.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.520]   Carr is not just a financial planner.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.960]   He is also a skilled business consultant.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:55.840]   His consulting specialty is enhancing the productivity of professional practices.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.800]   How did Bart establish himself as a mentor to dentists?
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.480]   He asked the various officers of the endodontist society and other key
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.760]   informants, this all important question.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:10.600]   What do endodontists really need?
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.400]   Interestingly, Mr.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   Carr's survey of key members proved that financial planning and insurance
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.080]   services were not at the top of his target audience's list of needs.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.200]   What issues were at the top of the list?
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.760]   Two of the most important were one, how to make the
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.240]   dental practice more productive.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.800]   Two, how to value or sell the dental practice.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.000]   Mr.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.920]   Carr proposed to the leaders of the endodontist profession that he and another
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.200]   expert conduct seminars on these issues.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.680]   He persuaded the nation's leading expert on valuing and selling dental practices
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.560]   to conduct seminars with him, not by offering to sell him life or disability
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   insurance, but by offering exactly what the expert needed, an opportunity to
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.600]   address thousands of prospective clients.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:59.400]   To date, thousands of endodontists have heard their message, a message from mentors.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.680]   This is why so many endodontists have sought Mr.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.680]   Carr's advice concerning financial and insurance matters.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.520]   Would this have happened if he did not first position himself as a mentor to the
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.680]   leaders, the society, and the rank and file of the endodontist profession?
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.240]   No, is the answer he gave to this question.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.320]   But Mr.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.640]   Carr is not the only networker who has served as a mentor before receiving
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.440]   the benefits gained by mentors.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.520]   A young top producing financial consultant recently asked me to send an autographed
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.040]   copy of my book to the owner manager of a luxury automobile dealership.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.480]   I asked him why he was being so kind.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.080]   He told me that he had developed an interesting method of generating new business.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.320]   He conducts selling to the affluent seminars for selected automobile
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.160]   dealers and their sales professionals.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:47.360]   In essence, his task as a mentor is to teach clients and prospects how to fish.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.560]   At the end of each of these seminars, this financial consultant has given time to
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.800]   lecture on investment related topics.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.360]   Each time he converts a dealership owner into a client, he asks, "Do you know any
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.640]   other dealers who might benefit from my services?"
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.440]   A financial planner is even more resourceful.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.840]   He had the courage, intellect, and audacity to network with the regional sales manager
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.480]   for a manufacturer of luxury automobiles.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.160]   What was the theme of his letter?
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.800]   "According to a recent newspaper report, the public views most automobile
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.560]   salesmen as being unprofessional."
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   Copy of trade article enclosed.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.480]   People in my industry have long faced the same problem.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.880]   Along these lines, I conduct seminars on how to put
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.520]   professionalism back into selling.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.120]   I'm sure your dealers could benefit from my message.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.000]   I have been a mentor to many people who today are truly sales professionals.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.640]   Hopefully we will be able to discuss these and related issues in person.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.280]   I will call your office next week."
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.640]   The regional sales manager did not wait until next week.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.800]   He took the initiative of contacting the mentor in this case.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.600]   Why?
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.680]   Because the mentor offered to help solve a major problem
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.800]   facing him and his industry.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.880]   Yes, it is often productive for sales and marketing professionals to
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.920]   become mentors to influential people.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.440]   Most networkers are by definition influential.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.320]   So consider the value of becoming a mentor to networkers.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.440]   This is truly a worthwhile vocation.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.480]   The Dean of Networking, the Networker of Networkers, is
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.760]   Ms. Jeannie Johnson of Dallas, Texas.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.400]   A recent news release featured her contribution to this growing field.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:24.040]   "Jeannie Johnson may not have invented networking, but she perfected it.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.480]   In February of 1988, Jeannie left her own investment advisory firm and
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.320]   concentrated on networking full-time.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.840]   She started a company called CEO Network.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.040]   CEO Network's mission was to enhance the professionalism of networking as a
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.600]   potentially unlimited means of generating business.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.480]   With the capitalization provided by member dues, many new and exciting
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.240]   networking concepts were initiated.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.720]   In just three years, over $24 million in new sales were generated among
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.360]   the members of CEO Network.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.720]   Networking works.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.760]   A network group is a marvelous asset for each member.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.320]   The group commits to helping members generate clients.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.240]   Members actually become a prospecting force for each other."
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.120]   Why does the Johnson system of networking produce good results for its members?
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.160]   Because Ms.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.160]   Johnson actually custom designs each networking group.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.240]   For instance, take a moment to place yourself inside the shoes of a CPA who
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.800]   wishes to target surgeons.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.480]   Ms.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.960]   Johnson will recruit members who can help in this regard.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.920]   She will find non-competing professionals and other types of
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.840]   suppliers for a network group.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.680]   But not just any non-competing professionals and suppliers.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.840]   The members she recruits will already have many clients and
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.240]   customers who are surgeons.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:37.040]   And ideally the CPA will already have a client or contact base that he will
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.800]   share with the other members of his network.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.080]   It is Ms.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.920]   Johnson's hands-on approach that makes her networking system so productive.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.720]   Her proactive role as a mentor to affluent networkers also bears
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.280]   fruit for the Johnson system.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.200]   As a direct result of her personal efforts, many influential people go out
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.120]   of their way to refer business to her.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.080]   As an example of high caliber mentoring, consider the following case study
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.000]   of how a Johnson network operates.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.840]   The plastic surgeon in the network gave a lead regarding a vineyard owner to
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.520]   the network's commercial real estate agent.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.480]   The real estate agent helped the vineyard owner select a site for a wine shop
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.080]   with a tasting room in Dallas.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.960]   After choosing the wine shop location, the real estate agent passed the lead
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.120]   to the network's advertising agent, who in turn recommended its printer and its
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.960]   property and casualty insurance agent.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.120]   Each network member landed the vineyard owner's business.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.280]   The vineyard owner was happy dealing with vendors who knew one another
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.960]   and cared about his success.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.600]   The members of the network felt that it had put forth a collective effort
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.000]   from which all of them benefited.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.080]   All the members of this network are taught by their mentor to give first
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.840]   rather than to receive first.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:47.280]   Most people fail in their attempts to network because they violate this procedure.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.920]   Chapter five details the strategies of several mentors.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.800]   Phase five, the publicist.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.640]   Generating publicity and related endorsements for others is often more
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.400]   important than promoting oneself.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.360]   This view is part of John Gorslein's philosophy of doing business.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.520]   It is one of the major reasons that Mr.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.280]   Gorslein is regarded by many as the premier supplier of life and disability
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.840]   insurance to world-class race car drivers.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.760]   The concept of insuring high-risk athletes is a very interesting one.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.360]   It is especially interesting to the reporters who cover auto racing.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.200]   Many of them have written feature articles about Mr.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.720]   Gorslein's commitment to insuring race car drivers.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:31.240]   Such articles have appeared in Auto Week, On Track, USA Today, The Detroit
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.280]   News, The Montreal Gazette, and The New York Times.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:38.160]   In the 17 paragraphs of The New York Times devoted to telling the Gorslein's
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.760]   story, the reporter posed an interesting question.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.360]   Quote, "Who in his right mind would sell a policy to someone who makes his living
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.040]   weaving through traffic at speeds that often exceed 200 miles per hour?"
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.280]   John Gorslein is one who does.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.080]   In fact, the Rochester-based insurance broker specializes in life and
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.000]   disability coverage for racing drivers.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.360]   The key to Gorslein's success is the individual approach
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.760]   he takes to assessing risk.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:06.400]   Insurance companies customarily evaluate and rate the riskiness
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.760]   of whole categories of people.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.800]   But Gorslein has persuaded several underwriters to insure his clients
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   on a person-by-person basis.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.880]   Close quote.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.280]   But person-by-person evaluation is not the only reason for Mr.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.400]   Gorslein's success.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.920]   Many world-class race car drivers refer their peers, other colleagues, and
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.360]   up-and-coming drivers to Mr.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:26.960]   Gorslein.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.920]   Why?
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.400]   When these world-class drivers were novices, he helped them with
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.960]   more than their insurance needs.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.160]   He went out of his way to endorse them.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:40.360]   He made important referrals on their behalf to writers, reporters, sponsors,
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.360]   team owners, and race car owners.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:46.040]   In fact, several of the top race car drivers in this country will tell you
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:46.520]   that Mr.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.440]   Gorslein helped them obtain their so-called "rookie test."
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:54.160]   Passing this test is required to obtain a race car driver's license.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.040]   Mr.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.760]   Gorslein has very close ties within the car racing community.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.520]   He serves on several important boards that represent the car racing industry.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:05.960]   But perhaps most important in terms of networking, he is a key source for
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.120]   the car racing media.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.040]   He goes out of his way to supply ideas, wisdom, and case
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.640]   studies to various reporters.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.000]   In essence, many members of the press rely on him for provocative case
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.960]   studies and new ideas for their articles.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.760]   Many members of the car racing media are in Mr.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.640]   Gorslein's debt.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.000]   He always makes himself available to the press for
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.880]   interviews and debriefing sessions.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.560]   In regard to the car racing circuit, he is a cosmopolitan man.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.600]   Last year, he logged over 300,000 miles flying to car races all over the world.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   He also spends considerable time debriefing other key informants
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.080]   about current events in car racing.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.960]   Mr.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.640]   Gorslein is an information and influence conduit within the car racing industry.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:51.000]   So when he endorses a novice driver to the car racing press, sponsors, and
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.360]   other important players in the industry, that driver is likely to be
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.440]   recognized as a future superstar.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.160]   Interestingly, Mr.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.640]   Gorslein does not limit his endorsements to his clients.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.720]   In fact, he endorses any driver who he feels has exceptional talent.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.400]   His integrity in this regard is one of the most important reasons
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.240]   for his success in networking.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.480]   It took Mr.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.800]   Gorslein many years of hard work and dedication to become a distinguished
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.680]   member of the car racing community.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.120]   Do all sales and marketing professionals have to wait for years before they can
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.360]   benefit from networking via the publicist role?
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.160]   No.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.960]   Several of the successful publicists mentioned in chapter six are
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.040]   relative newcomers to networking.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.240]   Phase six, the family advisor.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.000]   Most accountants, bank credit officers, financial planners, financial
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.400]   consultants, and life insurance agents can estimate the costs that clients
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.640]   are likely to incur in providing their children with a college education.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.680]   But funding may not be the major issue in this matter.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.160]   Some children of the affluent do not generate good high school grades.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.040]   Thus they may be unable to gain admittance to the college of their choice.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.640]   Developing an investment plan for funding Johnny's college education
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.000]   makes little sense if Johnny cannot get into college.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.880]   Several innovative networkers therefore play the role of family advisor to affluent
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.920]   families by helping them get into college.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.000]   Chapter seven addresses this and other problems that the affluent family may face.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.960]   The problems include the wish of children to move back home after completing their
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.840]   undergraduate or graduate programs, the drug or alcohol dependency of
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.440]   children or other family members.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:26.000]   The wish of grandparents to move into the home of a son or daughter, the
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.280]   inability of adult children to provide for the education of their offspring.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.320]   The conflict of children or grandchildren over the allocation of the proceeds from
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.920]   the liquidation of the family business.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.920]   At the very least, networkers can help families solve these problems by
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.480]   referring them to skilled specialists, thus playing a role akin to that of the talent scout.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.840]   Influential clients will go out of their way to endorse the networkers
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.560]   who helped Johnny to get into college.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.400]   The role of family advisor is also discussed in a section of chapter eight.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.480]   Phase seven, the purchasing agent.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.600]   Even extraordinary sales, marketing, and new business development
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.000]   professionals never fully utilize their skills and inherent talent.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.520]   This statement holds especially true for the dimension of networking that relates
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.240]   to acting as a purchasing agent for clients.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:13.160]   Do you want to attract and retain an increasing number of important clients?
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.000]   Do you want to influence opinion leaders of the affluent?
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.960]   Do you want these opinion leaders to go out of their way to refer
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.920]   affluent prospective clients to you?
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.480]   If your answer to all of these questions is yes, then consider
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.400]   playing the role of purchasing agent.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.800]   If you're even moderately successful in selling, you are by
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.120]   definition an accomplished negotiator.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.840]   Selling is in essence, negotiating.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.080]   Each year you negotiate the sale of your offering with hundreds,
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.480]   perhaps thousands of clients.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.280]   Are you tired of always playing the role of seller?
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.960]   Why not reverse that role from time to time?
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.480]   Act as a buyer, working on behalf of clients, prospective clients,
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.880]   and other influential people.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.840]   What is the most distinctive role played by marketing professional, whom I
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.280]   designated as the ace of aces of networking?
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.960]   He often acts as an informal purchasing agent for clients.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.040]   See chapter eight.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.200]   Follow his lead.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.360]   How can you acquire the knowledge you need to become an astute buyer?
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.960]   You already have it.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.840]   List the tactics that your toughest clients and prospective clients
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.480]   employed when you negotiated with them as a seller.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:18.640]   Use these tactics when you make purchases for clients who are not skilled buyers.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.280]   Compare your skills and experiences with those of your clients.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.560]   Most of them lack your skills in relating to people.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.520]   And many of them don't have the time, interest, or courage needed to ask
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.880]   sellers for a so-called better deal.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.480]   Most of your clients are not seasoned buying professionals.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.240]   Yet these clients often make both personal and business purchases.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:43.480]   Many of them lose thousands of dollars each year by cutting bad deals.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.480]   Describing his own experiences with such clients, the ace of aces of
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.880]   networking notes that many of my clients find it demeaning to
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.240]   ask the seller for a discount.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.680]   This applies to the purchases of everything from expensive homes,
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.680]   luxury automobiles, commercial real estate, even businesses.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.720]   That's where I come in.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.360]   I offer my skills free of charge as an informal purchasing agent.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.680]   It's a lot easier to negotiate on behalf of a client than
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.240]   to negotiate even for yourself.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.320]   I have saved my clients thousands and thousands of dollars.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.520]   It is just part of my commitment to clients.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.840]   There is another benefit of being a purchasing agent for clients.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.920]   How difficult is it for a client to ask you to reduce your fees?
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.120]   It may be very difficult if you recently saved the, that client's
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:30.280]   $70,000 by negotiating the purchase price of a home offered at $1.1 million.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.640]   Not long ago, the ace of aces of networking cut this deal
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.800]   for an influential client.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.000]   No, the client never asked him for a discount on his fee, but he did
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.840]   refer several important prospects to him.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.160]   Whom would you like to represent you?
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.760]   A professional who provides only the very basic service or one who will
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.320]   negotiate aggressively and wisely on your behalf.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:54.000]   Chapter eight provides a profile of the best networker in the context
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.440]   of a summary of the eight faces of networking.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.400]   While this networker often acts as a purchasing agent for clients,
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.600]   he also plays the seven other roles.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.440]   Face eight, the loan broker.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.480]   Mr.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:05.760]   W.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.720]   Robert Williams is no ordinary attorney.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.880]   He is a senior partner of a highly successful law firm.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.760]   Mr.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.480]   Williams will tell you that he owes his success to providing clients
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.480]   with more than mere legal advice.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:21.000]   Take for example, some of his recent exploits in the role of loan broker.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.600]   Keep in mind that credit is one of the most important needs of affluent
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.040]   business owners and professionals.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.320]   Recently, Mr.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.120]   Williams contacted the publisher editor owner of a fledgling trade journal
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.600]   directed to owners of family businesses to propose that the journal publish
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.840]   his article on estate planning.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.760]   However, before discussing his own objective, he debriefed the publisher
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.800]   and discovered that the trade journal was suffering from growing pains.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.920]   Although the journal clearly had significant potential for
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.040]   making considerable profits, it was in dire need of a short-term credit infusion.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.520]   Two local banks had turned down the publisher's loan applications.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.240]   Another financial institution had agreed to lend him money, but he felt that the
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.760]   loan rate and the origination fees were far too high, Mr.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.360]   Williams is highly skilled negotiator and networker offered the publisher his
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.800]   assistance in obtaining a loan at a competitive rate, he said.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.960]   I often help my clients obtain competitively priced loans.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:11.800]   I do it all the time.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.200]   I work with over a dozen enlightened bank officers.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.760]   I send them a lot of business.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.160]   They owe me a lot of favors.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.280]   So they rarely turned down an application that has my endorsement.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:24.080]   If they turned down someone I recommend, I never send them any more business.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.040]   And they know I'm a man of my word.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.960]   As a result of Mr.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.560]   Williams' loan brokering activities, the publisher obtained a short-term
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.640]   loan four days after applying for it.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.800]   In fact, several financial institutions competed against one another in attempting
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.680]   to obtain the publisher as a client.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.480]   Mr.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.320]   Williams also benefited from this arrangement.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.600]   The publisher had Mr.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.720]   Williams' firm develop an estate plan for him.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.360]   Eventually the publisher also endorsed Mr.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:52.000]   Williams and the firm to all of his major suppliers, printers, office
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.200]   equipment dealers, media sales representatives, graphic designers, and so on.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   And perhaps most important, the publisher proposed that Mr.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.000]   Williams write a series of short articles about the estate planning
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   needs of owners of family businesses.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.840]   And a column responding to readers' questions about such topics as minimizing
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.800]   estate tax, transferring the family business to the next generation, and
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.280]   dealing with insurance and estate tax liabilities.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.240]   The publisher also invited Mr.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:21.880]   Williams to share his booth at his industry's National Trade Association meeting.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.160]   At that meeting, Mr.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.840]   Williams' theme once again was, "Ask the expert about your estate planning needs."
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.960]   How should Mr.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.480]   Williams have responded to the publisher's proposals?
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.400]   How would you have responded if you had been in his position?
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:37.600]   Today, more than 10,000 owners of family businesses subscribed to
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.080]   the once struggling trade journal.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.720]   Several thousand people attend the industry's National Trade Association
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.840]   meeting as a regular contributor to both the journal and the trade association
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.800]   meeting, Mr.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.880]   Williams can invite other non-competing networking professionals to get access
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.480]   members of his targeted affinity group.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.520]   In this way, he can give visibility to top-notch accountants, public relations
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.600]   experts, marketing consultants, and so on.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.640]   Mr.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.520]   Williams' networking efforts are not limited to for-profit organizations.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.400]   When he moved into a new home several years ago, Mr.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.840]   Williams also changed churches.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.560]   He contributed his talent and skills to his new church.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.480]   The minister asked him to serve on its executive committee.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   The executive committee consists of more than 150 church members, most of whom are
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.200]   successful self-employed business owners and professionals.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.720]   The church's credit problems were discussed during the first executive
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.800]   committee meeting that Mr.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.680]   Williams attended.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.800]   The church had an outstanding million dollar note.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.040]   This loan was used to complete the church's youth center.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.880]   The interest rate on the note was well above the current norm.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.480]   However, the minister informed the executive committee that the lending
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.120]   institution holding the note absolutely refused to lower the interest rate.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.720]   After the executive meeting, Mr.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.120]   Williams obtained the minister's agreement to arrange another meeting with
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.880]   the officers of the lending institution.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.320]   He accompanied the minister to this meeting.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.320]   Within 10 minutes, the church was no longer burdened with an unconscionable
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.600]   interest rate on the note.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.840]   Why did the lending institution lower its interest rate?
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.560]   Mr.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.440]   Williams explained to its officers that he had contacted several other lenders
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.040]   and that two of them were already committed to lending the church
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.800]   money at one over prime.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.840]   One of these lenders happened to be the major competitor of the lending
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.520]   institution.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.720]   Thus, Mr.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.640]   Williams' network of sensitive lenders contributed to a higher cause.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.880]   Mr.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.320]   Williams was ultimately rewarded for his efforts.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.600]   To date, more than two dozen members of his church have become clients of his
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.000]   firm.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.720]   Positive word of mouth endorsements spread very rapidly through tightly knit
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.120]   affluent affinity groups.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.080]   But what was the cornerstone of the rapid diffusion of positive
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.000]   information about Mr.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:39.480]   Williams?
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.200]   Remember that people will go out of their way to endorse you if you do
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.160]   things that go beyond the core offering.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   During a recent executive committee meeting, the minister told the members,
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.040]   "I have some important news.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.200]   We have recently been informed that the interest rate on our note has been
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.280]   substantially lowered."
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.280]   He then went on to acknowledge Mr.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.040]   Williams' efforts.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.040]   He introduced Mr.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.000]   Williams as "an estate attorney who obtains credit for noble causes and even
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.520]   clients.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.840]   It's all part of his service commitment to our church and community."
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:07.920]   Mr.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.360]   Williams' estate planning business is a very successful one, but his estate
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.000]   planning skills do not fully explain his success.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.400]   Much of his business is generated by his efforts to cultivate strong
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.720]   relationships with what he calls "enlightened credit sources."
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:25.440]   Chapter nine details the loan broker concept.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:28.840]   End of the introduction.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.960]   I hope that I have piqued your interest in Stanley's book.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.800]   It is quite excellent.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.880]   And I hope that I have piqued your interest in thinking about how you can
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.240]   more effectively serve others.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.720]   When you look through the headlines, you and I have no way of knowing and
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:50.600]   probably will never know whether somebody has a certain connection or a
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.160]   certain bit of influence and whether that is just the normal functioning of
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.840]   human life or whether there's some kind of special backroom deal.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.440]   Right?
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.320]   How would we ever know?
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:06.520]   So all we can do is presume innocence until proven guilty and try to believe
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.960]   the best about other people.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.240]   But what I've just read to you doesn't involve government politics.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.640]   It involves individuals, individuals helping and serving other people.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.400]   If you study politicians, what you'll usually find is that politicians prior,
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:26.960]   at some point prior to their move into politics, have learned and perfected or
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.640]   are in the process of perfecting these basic skills.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.160]   And what they do is they go from dealing with one affinity group that may be
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.600]   around an industry or a certain cause to going to an affinity group that usually
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.160]   involves a geographic area.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.840]   And they simply apply those same skills.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:49.000]   So whether that's the mayor of your town lobbying for your town to be successful
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.680]   as compared to other towns, whether it's a local representative of some kind or a
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:58.320]   local governor of some kind, they just simply take one affinity group.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.600]   Previously, they worked with car dealers and they just simply adjust
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.360]   that into a different direction.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:09.840]   But the basic principle for you and me to always remember is the principle of service.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.200]   I always go back to that most important statement by Jesus.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.840]   "He who would be the greatest among you must be the servant of all."
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:24.240]   If you think about that, that sets out the basic paradigm of success in this world.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:29.680]   If you want to be effective, if you want to be great, you must serve effectively.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:34.760]   So if you want your clients to respect you, you need to serve them effectively.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:39.400]   If you want your customers to appreciate you and to promote you, you must serve
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.400]   them effectively.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.000]   And if you want your constituents to vote for you and to move you forward, you have
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.600]   to serve them effectively.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.440]   You cannot forget who it is that you actually serve.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.680]   If you've never discussed the topic of networking, you've never studied it, just
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.560]   consider this.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:00.040]   If you're looking for a safety net to put underneath your family, your social safety
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:04.440]   net that you develop is a powerful tool in your arsenal.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:11.840]   If you can pick up the phone and get yourself, get your son a job making $600,000
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:19.080]   per year, you now have a powerful tool that you can use for the success and
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.160]   well-being of your family.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:26.240]   When you can do that, it really doesn't matter how much money is in your kid's
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.360]   529 account.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.160]   Really doesn't matter how much money you have.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:37.160]   So while you're developing your financial capital, develop your social capital.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.840]   And if you've never studied the topic of networking, I encourage you pick up a copy
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.400]   of Stanley's book, Networking with the Affluent.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:48.720]   Read it, consider the examples and see how you can apply them to your own life.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:53.640]   Hey parents, join the LA Kings on Saturday, November 25th for an unforgettable
