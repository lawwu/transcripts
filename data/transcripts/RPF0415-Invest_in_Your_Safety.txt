[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.800]   Flying direct with Fiji Airways.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.920]   There are all kinds of little small cheap decisions that you and I can make that on
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:47.040]   the front end don't cost a lot, but on the back end can have a huge, huge benefit.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:56.940]   And today I want to encourage you to think about safety, to invest in safety and to experience
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.920]   the benefits of safety over the long term in your own personal life.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.840]   Before we get to that, sponsor of the day today is You Need a Budget.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.840]   Guess what?
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.840]   You Need a Budget.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.800]   And the best budgeting software for you to use each and every day is YNAB.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.380]   YNAB stands for You Need a Budget.
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.720]   It's the budgeting software that I just got done closing down on my computer and finishing
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.720]   myself.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.880]   So I put my money where my mouth is on this one.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.040]   I use all of our sponsors except for Paladin.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.960]   On Paladin I don't use them because I already am set when it comes to financial advice.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.440]   But the rest of them I use.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.080]   And YNAB is one of those that I use.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.080]   Here's how it works.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.400]   It's the best budgeting software that you can use because it allows you to actively
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.480]   allocate the money that's in your checking account and tell it where to go.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.660]   Not just track it, tell it where to go.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.160]   This practice, if you put this into practice over the course of the coming days, in the
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.440]   upcoming year, this will make a huge difference in your life.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.680]   Sign up for a free 34-day trial at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/YNAB.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.160]   Sign up for the trial and take all of the free classes that they have.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.840]   YNAB will teach you how to budget and budgeting will give you the results that you need, the
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.040]   money that you need to invest.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.560]   Sponsor of the day number two today is the patrons of the show.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.520]   In recent days I've been increasing the sponsorship ads.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.560]   I don't want those of you who support the show though to think that I don't appreciate
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.560]   you.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.480]   And so I just wanted to simply invite you, if you would like to bypass the sponsorship
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.840]   and just simply say, "Joshua, I get a ton of value out of what you're doing," please
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.280]   consider becoming a patron of my show.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.120]   You can do that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.360]   That is entirely voluntary.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.260]   The content is released to you for free.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.440]   You don't have to pay for it with anything other than your time.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.880]   But if you find value in it and you would like to engage in a voluntary value for value
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.680]   transaction, please go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and sign up to support the show.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.480]   You can do it with as little as a buck a month.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.880]   You can do it with a few hundred dollars a month.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   That's up to you.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.040]   What I recommend to you is that you take the amount of money, the benefit that you've received
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.520]   from my show in the last year, take 10% of that, figure out what that would be on a monthly
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.400]   basis and send it over to me.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.640]   And in exchange for that, I will do my very best to continue giving you as much benefit
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.160]   every single day, walking with you down your journey to financial independence and financial
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   freedom.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.160]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.960]   I got a little messed up there.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   Then I messed up my music.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:48.080]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.520]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful and long life
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.520]   now while also building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.160]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.440]   And today I am your safety police.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.280]   But I think I've got justification for that to show you how a few simple decisions will
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:16.760]   make all the difference in the world.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.920]   Today's show will be very, very specific, very straight to the point.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.120]   And the point, I'll sum it up in a sentence.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.760]   And if you grasp the full meaning, you can skip the rest of the show.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.840]   It's simply this.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.040]   If you take very careful, small decisions to prioritize your personal safety and the
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.160]   safety of your family members, that has the potential to avoid a significant amount of
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160]   pain.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.740]   When we talk about finance, we could talk a lot about the concept of insurance.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.680]   And we all recognize the value of insurance, even though we don't necessarily always love
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.160]   participating in insurance programs.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.920]   The idea of insurance is there are certain things that can happen to us that are really,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.160]   really bad, that have high negative consequences.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.120]   Some of these things would be things like dying prematurely and leaving our family bereft
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.640]   of income, or perhaps getting in a car accident and having our car destroyed.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.720]   There are many types of things that are having our house burned down, many things that are
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.040]   very low probability, but the impact is very, very high.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.440]   And that is the appropriate place for insurance.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.600]   High impact, low probability events can be effectively insured against, and you generally
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.880]   should always choose to insure against those problems.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.920]   But there are many other things in life that if you just simply look at them and pay attention
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.720]   to them, there's a very low cost, but a potentially high impact.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   And I want to give you some rationalization for this financially so that you'll be more
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:52.200]   motivated to take simple steps toward insuring your health and your safety.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.400]   Basically it comes down to this.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.720]   If you're riding a bike, consider getting a helmet and wearing one.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.840]   If you're driving in your car, consider putting on a seatbelt and/or consider driving a safe
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.840]   car.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.700]   If you're going to go out and mow the lawn, put on some hearing protection.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.960]   We like to, in our modern society, we like to look at people who smoke, the increasingly
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.400]   smaller percentage of the population, the US American population that smoke cigarettes.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.680]   We like to look at them and say, "Why on earth do people smoke cigarettes?"
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.280]   In light of all of the evidence that is available of how cigarette smoking leads to cancer and
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.880]   leads to early death.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.200]   And yet so many of us continue to do simple things that could be easily avoided by paying
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.440]   attention.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.160]   Again, my favorite examples would be things like eye protection and hearing protection.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.760]   I have a friend of mine who's a retired firefighter.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.920]   That poor guy's practically half deaf and he knows it, but it's from long exposure to
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.160]   loud noises.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.300]   It's to the very best of my knowledge, I've never heard a conspiracy theory that this
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.300]   data is true.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.380]   To the very best of my knowledge, it is absolutely a proven medical fact that if you maintain
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.980]   high exposure to loud audio for an extended period of time, that will damage your hearing
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.620]   in a cumulative effect.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.740]   So therefore, if you listen to me in your earbuds at too high of a volume, that's not
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.020]   good.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.500]   If you listen to music in your ears at too high of a volume, that will damage your hearing.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.980]   Almost as surely as smoking will kill you.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:38.060]   If you systematically go out and use loud power equipment on a daily basis or on a regular
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:44.380]   basis, going out and driving around on your lawnmower or using, again, power tools or
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.420]   being in a very noisy environment and not taking care of your hearing, you will wind
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.380]   up deaf.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.820]   Now think about the cost and benefit of this.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.740]   What does it cost you to avoid that?
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.020]   Those loud noises?
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.260]   Well you can buy a set of foam earplugs to put in your ear that will dampen a lot of
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.440]   the noise for 30 cents.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.320]   You can trot down to the big box store and grab yourself a pair of over the ear earmuffs
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.260]   for about $3.95.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:22.200]   And that $3.95 investment in your hearing has the possibility to save you thousands
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.060]   of dollars of hearing aid expenses later in life.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:32.500]   It doesn't cost all that much to put on a pair of safety glasses when doing something
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.500]   that's safe.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.180]   It's easy to do.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.980]   Easy to do.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.900]   And the potential benefit of something heads for your eyes is huge in terms of your own
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.900]   personal protection.
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.800]   And yet how many of us are guilty of doing things that we know would probably be better
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.320]   like mowing the lawn or using power equipment, et cetera.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.220]   And yet we don't take the simple step of putting on safety glasses.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.380]   How many of you have ever run a chainsaw without chainsaw shaps?
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.860]   You know the Kevlar shaps that you put on that protect your legs in case the chainsaw
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.220]   goes into it?
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.020]   I think we're all guilty of that one.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.220]   It'd be so simple to spend the 60 bucks and take a moment and strap those things on.
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:20.140]   And it would potentially save a leg, potentially save a serious medical visit, potentially
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.660]   save a life.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.500]   And yet how many people do you see that take just a moment, grab the proper safety equipment
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.220]   and put it on?
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.500]   Very few of us do it.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.580]   I grew up riding my bike without a bike helmet.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.400]   It wasn't mandated for children when I was younger.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.220]   And I've generally ever since then continued that practice just because I never really
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.120]   went helmet shopping.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.180]   But a few years ago I realized how silly that was.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.980]   There's no reason not to take a moment, find a bike helmet and put it on.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.020]   Has the potential of saving my life or avoiding brain injury.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:04.300]   So simple and cheap and easy and yet how easy not to do.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:14.060]   So don't let your, for most of you, it's probably a male/female thing.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.660]   My experience is that women are usually more amenable to safety standards and usually,
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:24.820]   not always, but oftentimes it's we men who in our macho approach don't want to do that.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:30.220]   Men don't let your kind of macho aggressive arrogance keep you from doing some simple
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.660]   things that can keep your hearing, that can keep your speech, that can keep your eyesight
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.280]   around for potentially a much longer period of time.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.020]   The cost of these very simple and small changes is very, very low.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.500]   And yet the potential benefit is very, very high.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.500]   Where else are you going to get investment returns like that?
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:55.700]   A few dollars of safety gear and a potential savings of thousands or hundreds of thousands
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.980]   of dollars.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:04.820]   There's a reason why if I were hired in a large company or something like that, one
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.340]   of the first things I would do would be absolutely to make sure that all of my workers were using
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:14.260]   proper safety equipment in any circumstance or situation that they needed to, that it
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.740]   was appropriate.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.980]   Because on the aggregate, that will save me and my company a tremendous amount of money
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.820]   from liability, from accidents, et cetera.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.940]   And the only way that you avoid this is the fact that the chances of it happening to you
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.300]   as an individual are very small.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:36.340]   We know this happens consistently across a population, but we don't know who it happens
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.760]   to.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.580]   So buy the safety gear, buy the safety equipment for you, for your children.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.140]   A lot of times it costs a little bit more money to get safety gear that is comfortable
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.140]   and is stylish.
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.420]   Don't be scared to spend a little bit more money on safety gear that's comfortable and
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.540]   stylish if it means that you'll actually wear it.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.860]   Don't cheap out and get the junky thing that's hard to wear that you don't like to wear because
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.860]   then it won't do its good.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.260]   If you know, if your children, make sure that you buy them the gear that is going to be
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.300]   effective for them, if it needs, again, if it can be gotten with this little bit of style,
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.780]   make sure you do that.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.660]   And then also don't be scared to think about this in a broader sense.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.860]   I wholeheartedly recognize that this is something that with increasing age, I've become more
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.940]   aware of.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.740]   When I was younger, I didn't ever think about the safety of a vehicle.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.500]   I never even just bothered with it.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.840]   I had that same sense of invincibility that probably most of us have had.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.860]   But as I get older, the safety becomes increasingly important to me and I'm willing to spend more
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.660]   money to have a safer vehicle for my family, for my children.
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.660]   I'm willing to make sure that we make different car choices or different travel choices to
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.060]   make sure that that safety is there.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.060]   Now, you don't have to automatically assume that that means you have to buy a $50,000
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.060]   car.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.900]   Simple examples that I use, I own two minivans.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.740]   Both of them have full five stars on all of the crash safety ratings.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.020]   One of them I paid $5,500 for four years ago.
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.060]   The other one I paid $3,000 for six months ago.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:10.640]   And yet both of them, according to the objective safety ratings, are as well rated as any other
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.440]   vehicle available today.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.020]   So you don't have to spend a lot of money, but you do have to consider it.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.180]   And then finally with this, I will close.
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.020]   Consider carefully some simple things in your own personal behavior.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:34.340]   Yes, life is good to be lived with zest and with gusto, but stupidity doesn't necessarily
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.220]   have to be equated with fun.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:42.820]   There are some things that you can do that are just plain old stupid.
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.660]   There are ways that you can have fun that aren't stupid.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:53.000]   Don't ignore the value of safety.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.220]   The gear can help, but the most important thing is just the simple voice in your head
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.500]   saying what I'm about to do is stupid.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.260]   If you find yourself saying, "Here, hold my beer.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260]   Watch this," stop.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.260]   Don't do it.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.960]   Don't follow through.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:19.140]   And if you find yourself in a situation where somebody else is doing things that are unsafe,
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.220]   stand up and stop.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.460]   Be the person who takes the keys out of the ignition.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.820]   Be the person who stands up and stops.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.580]   This is hard.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.540]   A couple of months ago, my family and I went to a harvest festival that was nearby in our
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.780]   town.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.860]   And at this harvest festival, they were doing hayrides for children.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.940]   They had just a small little compact tractor and a wagon there hooked up.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:46.460]   And so we thought it'd be fun to take the children on the hayride and we got on.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:52.180]   Right at the beginning though, we were there and somebody made an announcement that we
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.180]   couldn't quite hear.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.860]   And they said something about, in hindsight, I think they said something about like, "If
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.420]   you're here for the harvest festival, get off.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.940]   Or if you're here for the church group, youth group or something that it was at, then go
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.380]   ahead and stay on."
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.220]   We weren't quite sure and so we stayed on.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:15.420]   Well, the driver quickly, the driver started to drive the hayride very aggressively, very
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.860]   much focused on creating a thrilling ride for teenagers rather than a thrilling ride
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.500]   for three-year-olds.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.780]   And as the driver turned in circles, bounced over ground, et cetera, I became increasingly
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:30.300]   concerned, but I sat there and did nothing because I didn't want to...
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.700]   I didn't know what was going on and I didn't want to mess things up.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.100]   And it got worse and worse and I sat there and did nothing.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.340]   And in hindsight, I was absolutely wrong.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.140]   I didn't want to rock the social boat.
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.720]   So I sat there.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.980]   After a while, it became worse and worse and finally, I told the guy, I said, "Stop."
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:54.460]   I got up, got my wife and kids and I jumped out of it and I said, "This is unsafe.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.640]   I'm not going to do it."
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.300]   In hindsight, I was shocked at how hard it was for me to do that.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.380]   I am the adult.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.660]   I should have been the one in the first place to say, "No, this is not appropriate."
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.980]   I shouldn't have just been looking out for me and my children.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.500]   I should have been looking out for all those other children.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.100]   And the man who was driving, I've spent many years driving boats with children on tubes
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.140]   and driving trailers and things like that.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.300]   I can have a good ride without it being unsafe and the man was unsafe.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:25.740]   In hindsight, I regret that I didn't stop the whole thing, but I didn't have the courage
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.740]   in that moment to do it.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.020]   So don't follow my negative example of not having the courage.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.940]   Follow the positive example to have the courage.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.140]   If you're a young person and you're listening and you're in the car and somebody is hot
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.180]   riding the car, make them stop, get out, go home.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.600]   Turn the keys off.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.540]   Whatever you got to do, stop the situation.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:53.500]   If you're with people and they're drunk, be the person who saves the life.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:58.900]   Because the hindsight and the problems with disaster is generally most people know, but
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.660]   they don't stand up and do something.
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.420]   I don't have anything more to say other than just recognize that investing in safety is
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.880]   a perfectly valid and legitimate thing for you to choose to do.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.780]   It's a very wise investment.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.100]   Purchase safety gear when you purchase stuff.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.260]   Purchase quality safety gear.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:28.180]   Purchase if you need sunglasses, dark safety glasses and clear safety glasses.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.580]   If you need prescription safety glasses, get them.
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.100]   If you need quality earwear that is easy to wear, get it.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.760]   When I'm out shooting, I use the nice electronic earmuffs that stop the banging noise but yet
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.500]   still allow you to talk.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.580]   That means you'll wind up wearing them more.
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.740]   Invest in personal protective equipment, whatever that is.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.980]   That was one of the things I mentioned when the budget for the accessories show.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.460]   Buy quality stuff that will protect you.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.780]   Motorcycling, for example.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.620]   If you study, in the past I've always enjoyed riding a motorcycle.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.180]   Well, is that in contradiction with the safety?
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.980]   I'll tell you what I learned in my observation.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.140]   Are motorcycles inherently unsafe?
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:11.540]   I would say that yes, motorcycles are inherently less safe than cars but I think in anything,
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.620]   if you decide, okay, there's a benefit to it, you can mitigate it.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.980]   Simple examples of how I researched it at that point in time was number one, 50% of
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.060]   motorcycle accidents involve rider error.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:28.640]   The rider outriding their own personal ability.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:34.220]   If you want to be safe on a motorcycle, focus on never outriding your ability.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.620]   That's hard for many people to do, especially the type of person who generally rides motorcycles.
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.120]   A lot of times it's young and aggressive people who try to push the envelope and you push
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.420]   the envelope on a motorcycle and you wind up going over the edge of the cliff.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.060]   I made a commitment when I was first riding.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.220]   I said, number one, I will never outride my ability.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.220]   I will make the commitment not to follow that testosterone and just to enjoy it but within
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.380]   my ability.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.460]   Number two, 50% of motorcycle accidents involve alcohol.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:05.180]   Made the commitment that and with motorcycling, unlike driving, with driving you may be able
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:11.100]   to have one or two drinks and perhaps you're slightly over the blood alcohol level in your
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.380]   state but it's not really that big a deal.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:18.420]   In motorcycling, one or two drinks will disrupt just the tiniest thing and the impact is huge.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.820]   Number three is safety gear.
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.340]   Many people don't wear safety gear.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.260]   Would a quality helmet, a quality riding suit make a huge difference?
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.860]   Budget for those things.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.060]   Then finally, number four is proper training.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.540]   With most things, proper training is essential.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.460]   Whether you're operating a piece of power equipment, renting a backhoe for the weekend,
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.380]   driving a car, riding a motorcycle, et cetera, train and there are small little things that
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.420]   can make a huge difference.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:50.580]   On a motorcycle, it's simply by knowing the most dangerous places to be.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:57.940]   The most dangerous place to be is a road with a turn lane in the middle.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.900]   Simple safety habits where you're defensive driving, covering the brakes whenever you
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.860]   see a car, these little things that you can learn with training.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.860]   If you're going to engage, my point using the motorcycle example is that if you're going
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.220]   to engage in behavior that has the potential to be more risky because you've looked at
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.280]   it and said, "Okay, this is riskier behavior.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.820]   Life is not all about sitting in a padded cocoon so that I'm perfectly safe," at least
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.580]   do your research and do your due diligence on how to control as many safety factors as
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.580]   possible.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:33.700]   I believe your family, your friends, your loved ones will thank you for that.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.220]   Your future self will thank you.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.000]   If you can avoid some of the expensive, unnecessary expenses that older people have to account
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.580]   for the indiscretions of their youth, I think that you will be happy with that.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.460]   That's all I've got for you today.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.860]   As I go, I'm going to skip the music.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.860]   I just want to encourage you.
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.380]   If you could do me a favor, please, quick personal favor, come by and complete my quick
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:57.340]   20-second demographic survey found at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.340]   There are six questions.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.340]   You can do it right on your phone.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.420]   It's just a simple, anonymous demographic survey.
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.420]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.020]   There's a place on there you can put an email address.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.660]   I don't care if you do that or not.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.660]   It's not signing you up for a list or anything.
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.700]   I think it's just for the computer to sort it.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:21.180]   If you could just do that quick thing at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey, I would be deeply indebted to you.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:38.780]   With that, stay safe and I'll be back with you tomorrow.
