[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420]   What's your biggest paid fight?
[00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.940]   I got paid over $30 million for Tank Fight, yeah.
[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.780]   Because the pay-per-view numbers, they were crazy, you know, $1.2 million sold.
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.200]   Y'all get it all at one time, right?
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.840]   Nah, it's like broken up because like the pay-per-view sales, like they got to come in.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.040]   $12 million check here, $10 million check later, $5 million.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.380]   The numbers got to come in, so.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.880]   People that want to be in your shoes for the money, for the women, for the fame,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.500]   how fulfilling is that to you when you get it?
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.020]   It's like anything in life, short dopamine doesn't last.
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.940]   The story of Solomon, he had all the women, he had everything, the riches,
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.640]   and at the end he said, this is all vanity.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.760]   And honestly, that's what it is.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.920]   It doesn't fulfill you in any real way.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.980]   It's actually going to leave you empty.
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.300]   You're going to be by yourself and searching for, you know, what really mattered in life.
