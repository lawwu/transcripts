[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and what a past couple weeks we've had in
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.440]   the stock market. October 10th and 11th, we saw what, 800 something points on the Dow
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.840]   drop and then followed by another 550 points or something. So that was like 6% to 6.5%
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.840]   drop. And then the NASDAQ dropped more as tech stocks got slaughtered. You know, it
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.720]   was interesting because on October 10th, I was wondering to myself, okay, fine. So the
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.960]   10-year bond yield went to 3.25%. People are freaking out about higher borrowing costs,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.840]   you know, slow down in investments, using a higher discount rate to calculate the future
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.240]   cash flow of companies to value them. So I was like, okay, fine. It's dropping and that
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.120]   is a surprise, surprise move to 3.25%. But then on October 11th, I was thinking, wait
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.580]   a minute. So the 10-year bond yield now declined by about eight to nine basis points down to
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:07.120]   about what, 3.15%, 3.13%. And yet the market still went down another two to two and a half
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.640]   percent. So I thought, you know what, it's time to buy. It's time to buy. And I believe,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.360]   let's see what happens. The S&P 500 will close up about 8% for the year. We're going to rally
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.680]   into the close. And this sell off was irrational. It was one of those things where just, you
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.920]   know, algorithms, computers just hitting the sell button, rushing out. And it's just a
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.680]   one way trade out and it was just irrational. So as of October 16th, 2018, we got some relief
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.880]   in tech stocks. Well, Netflix, they reported better than expected third quarter results
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.920]   of the stock is up 10% after the close. So that should help give confidence, at least
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.480]   in the tech sector. And you saw bank stocks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley report pretty
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.760]   good numbers. So overall, I am pretty confident. Well, I believe with 70% probability, we're
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.460]   going to do well into the close and end the year on a higher note. But enough about the
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.680]   markets and buying the dips. In this podcast, I want to talk about how a $5 million investment
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.200]   portfolio provides a pretty average early retirement lifestyle. There's a lot of talk
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.720]   about how you need multi millions of dollars in after tax investments to retire early.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.640]   And I showed this in my after tax investment amounts by age post and podcast, which shows
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.040]   that yes, you actually do need millions of dollars because at a safe withdrawal rate
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.480]   or a 4% rate of return, you're not generating that much income. So if you have $5 million,
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.120]   you're generating at 4% rate of return $200,000 in gross income before tax. Now, here in San
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.400]   Francisco, the Department of Housing and Urban Development say that you are quote low income
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.960]   if you have income of less than $100,000 with a family of three or four. And if you talk
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.480]   to private grade schools, and also private universities, they also provide financial
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.240]   aid if you have income of less than $100,000 per kid. And what I find really, really interesting
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.920]   in the personal finance community is that there seems to be a lack of acceptance from
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.880]   literally half the population in the United States who live in the on the coast or in
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.440]   higher cost areas of the country, that yes, you actually do need multi millions of dollars
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.200]   to be able to retire early and support a family. You know, when toddlers close their eyes,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.720]   they think other people can't see them. That's fine. That's because their logic is still
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.920]   developing. But I wouldn't expect grown adults to think the same way. And we know what happened
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.440]   the last time, you know, half of America ignored the other half of America. I mean, wasn't
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.080]   there some type of surprise presidential victory the last time this happened? Yes, there was.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.840]   So I'm hoping in this podcast in this post, that, you know, all the people and all the
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.920]   personal finance bloggers who don't live on the coast, which is a majority of them for
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.400]   some reason, actually, it's probably not some reason it's because, you know, it's easier
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.040]   to retire earlier or achieve financial independence if you live in a low cost area of the country,
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.640]   right? That's obvious. But I hope through this post and podcast that more people realize
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.880]   how the other half live, right? Let's let's try to understand everybody else. You know,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.520]   it's as if the majority of Americans are overweight, wasteful in their spending and only speak
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.120]   one language or something. I mean, surely nobody's so irrational as to purposefully
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.400]   harm their long term wealth, health and mindfulness with their one and only life. So I don't believe
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.280]   financial samurai listeners and readers are irrational. I think we all do things to better
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.600]   ourselves over time. You know, if we want to lose weight, we're going to eat healthier
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.960]   and exercise more if we're going to want to achieve financial independence before 60.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.040]   We're going to save more, invest more wisely and take some calculated risks, right? It's
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:17.160]   all logical. So I believe that you need probably at least 3 billion and probably closer to
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.360]   5 million in after tax investments if you want to retire early. The key word here is
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.240]   early. So let's say you have a 4% annual rate of return on 5 million dollars. That equals
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:37.080]   $200,000 a year in passive income. And I'm fortunate to have Jerry and Linda, a couple
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.080]   financial samurai readers share their budget. So Jerry is 43 years old and has an eight
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.080]   month old daughter and a non working spouse named Linda, who is 35 years old. They've
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.320]   lived in Los Angeles for the past 20 years. And obviously Los Angeles is a higher cost
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.120]   area of the country. Weather is good, lots of employment opportunity, property prices
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.160]   are rising and so forth. So both decided to retire early in order to spend as much time
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.680]   as possible with their daughter. After both negotiated severance packages equal to $120,000
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.680]   for Jerry and $70,000 for Linda, they have a combined net worth of roughly $5.6 million
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.440]   if you include the $600,000 in equity they have in their primary residence, which they
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.040]   bought in late 2013 for a million dollars. Their goal is to stay retired forever, and
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.080]   perhaps do some part time consulting once their daughter goes to kindergarten. Neither
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.260]   parent is doing any sort of side hustling at the moment, because they want to be very
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.840]   present with their daughters. So Jerry and Linda are kind of like my family. I've cross
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.640]   referenced all the numbers based on my family's own household expenses over the past year
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.760]   since we have an 18 month old toddler and also live in California, and San Francisco
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.720]   is actually a little bit more expensive. So if you click over to the post, you'll see
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:05.400]   a detailed expense budget on how they live off $5 million in after tax investments in
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.320]   early retirement. And I wanted to go through these numbers here. So if we look at the income,
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.640]   it's $200,000 in investment income. And the good thing about investment income is that
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:23.560]   it's taxed at a lower rate than W-2 income. So $200,000 is taxed at a 15% capital gains
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:30.080]   tax rate, versus if they had made $200,000 from a day job, they would be taxed at 24%
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:37.280]   as a married couple. After paying roughly 8% in California state income tax, which unfortunately
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.200]   doesn't have a lower capital gains tax rate, Jerry and Linda's effective federal plus state
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:50.520]   tax is only 24% versus 30% if they were W-2 employees. So this is important to know. If
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.440]   you're able to generate investment income, not only is it passive, and you have to work
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.720]   for it, it's taxed at a lower rate. So it's a much more efficient way of earning. However,
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:08.200]   due to the state and local tax deduction cap, the salt cap of $10,000, they're losing out
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.640]   on probably at least $5,000 in tax refunds they would have received before Trump's tax
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:20.880]   reform act was passed. So coastal city real estate folks, you guys will feel the hit sometime
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.760]   in 2019 when you do your 2018 taxes. Trust me on this, folks. And I think once people
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.440]   see that, there's going to be a little bit of a another leg down in the real estate market
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.680]   on the coast. So again, because Jerry and Linda want to be completely present, they've
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.920]   promised not to do any activity to generate money before their daughter goes to preschool.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.960]   And as a result, they must be disciplined and stick to their budget if they want to
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:54.640]   remain retired. All right, so after taxes, and after getting a credit from the salt refund,
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:03.760]   their net income is $154,400. So think about that, folks, they're paying $48,000 in combined
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.920]   taxes. And that's a lot, right? Because the median household income in America is about
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:18.360]   $60,000. So their taxes alone are, you know, almost equal to the median household income.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.920]   So for these folks, don't be angry at them, they're actually contributing a lot to our
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.020]   great country. And so just don't forget that next time you want to hate on people who make
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:35.420]   a lot of money or more money than you. And let's look at the expenses here. And I hope
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:42.840]   you guys click over to the chart because this, this chart is pretty interesting. So childcare,
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:50.400]   because they have a daughter, their kid expenses per year is 36,000. So 36,000, the 10 hours
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.440]   a week of childcare assistance is extremely important to them to keep their sanity. Sometimes
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.260]   they go and use this time to go on dates. Other times they use these hours to have me
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.940]   time to get away from each other, which is really, really important. Because being a
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.820]   stay at home parent is really hard. And I've gone through this for 18 months. And it is
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.900]   so much easier having a day job, even a banking job, even a strategy consulting job, any job
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.600]   you can think of is so much easier than being a full time parent, because there's never,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.140]   ever really an off switch. But it gets easier, it gets easier every month their daughter
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.460]   sleeps a little better through the night. Now they take their daughter to swim class
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:34.340]   twice a week, and gym class once a week. And other other days, they go to the local science
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.340]   museum. And they have a family membership there. And they also go to the zoo when the
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:45.760]   weather's okay. And that's like another $150 an annual family membership. And despite each
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:52.700]   being able to contribute about 11,000. So 11,000 each, the 22,000 a year total, they
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.260]   can't do more, even though they can do more, right, you can contribute 15,000 each, that
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:03.340]   won't hit your estate. And so that's total of 30,000. But they can't do more than 22,000.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.740]   If they want to maintain their lifestyle. They don't believe making their daughter a
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:12.660]   five to nine millionaire is particularly wise, given the possible lack of motivation, so
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.100]   much money might cause, although they think sending their daughter to public school in
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.860]   order to make her a millionaire upon graduation sounds pretty good. And I agree with that
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:29.620]   wholeheartedly. Because look, internet technology is making education accessible and free. So
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:35.540]   all this like pedigree stuff, you know, it's nice, look, hey, if my son got into Princeton
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:41.860]   and XYZ grade school and got a scholarship that I'd be, you know, to the moon. But I'm
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.100]   going to try not to stress about it. Because pedigree doesn't really matter anymore. It's
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:52.980]   what you do. Alright, so property about $4,800 a month, which believe it or not, for West
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:58.340]   LA is pretty reasonable. You know, they live in a modest 1500 square foot three bedroom
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.860]   two bathroom home at the edge of Santa Monica, Santa Monica is a prime neighborhood, but
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:08.920]   they're at the edge, you know, closer to the inland. Their house is valued at 1.3 million,
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.820]   or 400,000 below the median priced home in the area. And again, they bought it for a
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.420]   million dollars about five years ago. And that's about right. They've been thinking
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:23.300]   about upgrading to a house closer to 2500 square feet, because having a kid really shrinks
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:30.060]   your house by about 30%. But such a house will cost about $2 million in the neighborhood,
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:35.980]   maybe even more, but actually maybe less now that the coastal market is slowing. And so
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:42.140]   they decided not to, they read my buy utility, rent luxury strategy, borough strategy. And
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.220]   they decided to keep costs low and earn a higher rental yield in other parts of the
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:53.020]   country through real estate crowdfunding, and aristocrat dividend stocks instead. So
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:58.580]   one of the key things about early retirement is healthcare premiums. It's actually the
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.660]   thing that probably bothers me the most and that people really, really need to be aware
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:09.640]   of. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average annual premium for employer based
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:22.580]   family coverage in 2018 is $19,616, or that's $1,635 a month. And the breakdown is $14,069
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:28.780]   comes from the employer, while 5547 comes from worker contributions, right? So it's
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:34.460]   subsidized by the employer. And you the worker got to pay on average, I don't know, 450 to
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:40.520]   $450 a month. That sounds about right. I remember when I was working, I paid about $200 to $250
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:48.120]   a month in premiums, just for myself. So think about this, folks. J&L, given they no longer
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:54.240]   have jobs, they must bear the entire cost of health insurance. So we're talking $1,650
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:00.240]   a month for a gold plan. They decided with an 18, sorry, eight month old daughter, they
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.160]   decided not to mess around and maintain a gold health insurance plan. Their daughter
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.560]   not only sees a pediatrician every three months, but she also sees an ophthalmologist every
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:16.160]   three months because she has ocular albinism and strabismus. strabismus is a misalignment
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:22.920]   of the eye. Some say it's a esotropia, exotropia, a lazy eye, and they need to make sure her
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:29.280]   daughter's prescription is correct to help her eyes align properly during development.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.520]   So in the first five years of life, it's important, you know, all the wires and neurons in your
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:40.960]   brain basically are getting wired and hardwired. But there's plasticity in the brain. So especially
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.080]   in the first five years, you can kind of mold your child and the neurons to where you best
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.960]   see fit. But after about five to 10 years old, they start hardwiring and it's really
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:58.920]   hard to change. And so maybe maybe God not willing, she might require surgery, but who
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.280]   knows, hopefully glasses will help. So health insurance is clearly one of the largest and
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:09.200]   most necessary expenses early retirees must consider. And you could get Affordable Care
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:15.140]   Act subsidies if your household income is below a certain threshold. But J and L need
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:20.720]   the income to live and don't want to draw down principles so early. The next line item
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:28.080]   is food at $1,800 a month. Is that a lot? Maybe, but I don't think so. They value their
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.880]   time Jerry and Linda more than anything. As a result, they're happy to pay $5 for food
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.320]   delivery and save one to two hours of cooking in order to spend more time with their daughter.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.840]   Food is the one area where they could cut expenses by maybe $500 a month if they ever
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:49.600]   get desperate. Los Angeles consistently ranks as one of the healthiest cities in America
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.920]   and also one of the best cities for food. They've got huge variety and really healthy
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:00.000]   food selection. You know, there are vegan, vegetarian restaurants and all that. So at
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.240]   the end of the day, combine their food selection with the ubiquity of food delivery companies
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:11.040]   and they can't help but continuously order great food most of the week. They also supplement
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:17.360]   their grocery shopping with Amazon Prime about once a month as well. And so all in $1,800
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:25.000]   a month for three people. What is that? $60 a day. I don't think that's that unreasonable
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.760]   folks. You let me know. In terms of non-essential expenses, they hardly ever buy new clothing
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:38.000]   for themselves. So they're spending, you know, definitely less than $200 a month. Their $330
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.560]   a month sports club they think is well spent, you know, fitness, health, social aspect,
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.680]   it's all there and they go three times a week. And finally, they decided to stay local for
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.960]   the first two to three years of their daughter's life. They have so much of Los Angeles, Newport
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:17:00.280]   Beach, Big Bear, San Diego, left to explore that, hey, why not just explore as a family
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.680]   together? They can go to Las Vegas as well. Besides, they agree with me that extensive
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:10.000]   travel before the age of three and probably before the age of five is a waste of time
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.360]   since their daughter won't remember a thing when she's older. You know, my wife and I,
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:19.480]   we recently went to just an hour away trip to Sonoma at a friend's house. And it was
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:26.160]   an amazing, amazing place and we stayed there for six nights. And it was awesome. But man,
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:35.160]   we filled our car to the brim with food supplies, with like a crib, with a stroller, just bumpers
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.600]   for the bed guard, toys, books, you name it. And of course, obviously our stuff. So I can't
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:47.040]   imagine flying with that much luggage with our son. So in terms of, you know, budget
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:53.200]   cuts, once again, they could cut money with food, food delivery, they could spend less
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.200]   money on childcare, and they could contribute less to their daughter's five to nine plan
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.960]   that overall will save maybe 5000 to 10,000 a year. But I'm not sure and they're not sure
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.680]   the additional savings would outweigh the decline in their lifestyle. Because if you
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.760]   look at the budget, again, it's not that extravagant. I just don't see that much extravagance. They
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:20.840]   are really responsible with regards to providing whatever it is for their child's future. You
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.040]   know, they could move to a lower cost area of the country. That's obviously, you know,
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.320]   something a lot of people have suggested. A lot of people have told me, hey, Sam, why
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.280]   don't you leave San Francisco because it's so expensive. And hey, guess what, folks,
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.360]   I am planning that move. Once our son, you know, is old enough to go to preschool, or
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:44.320]   maybe kindergarten plan go to Hawaii, which is cheaper, believe it or not. But JNL, they'd
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.640]   rather stay warm all year, rather than face the brutal Midwest winters. Come on, folks,
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:55.440]   it's brutal. For four months a year. You know, life is about living 12 months a year. Further,
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:02.000]   as a Latino, and as an Asian woman, and as a daughter who is mixed race, do they prefer
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.760]   the diversity of LA that can only be matched by even more expensive places like New York
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:12.240]   City or San Francisco? I don't know if you folks, you know, who are not minorities realize
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.080]   this, but being in an environment with diversity is really, really, really important. Just
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.240]   the food, the culture, the festivals, and just feeling comfortable, you know, walking
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.280]   around, driving around. When there's more diversity, there's more acceptance. And I
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.080]   think that's a wonderful thing. So instead of these budget cuts and moving, it seems
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.440]   better to just continue sticking to their budget and earn supplemental income if they
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:41.120]   ever need or want more money. So for example, they could clearly do part time consulting,
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:47.840]   let's say 10 hours a week combined. So five hours each at $100 an hour, and earn $52,000
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.600]   a year. Why do I believe they can do that? Well, I did that. And if you look at their
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:58.200]   backgrounds, Jerry was 20 years as a management consultant. And Linda was, let's see, I don't
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.320]   know, 15 years, something like that. 13, 13 to 15 years in digital marketing. So they
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:10.400]   clearly have some expertise, and a lot of work, a lot of work is now being done for
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.320]   freelancers as freelance jobs, because it's cheaper and more flexible for companies. So
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.160]   the trend is there folks, and it's easy for them to make more money and bridge any kind
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.280]   of gap or shortfall if they have one. Every single early retiree I know eventually does
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.400]   something they love that generates some type of income. They have the energy, enthusiasm
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.280]   and expertise since they're still relatively young, right? late 30s, early 40s. And pursuing
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.380]   something you love to do while making money is the dream scenario, folks. So this pursuance
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.760]   is what early retirement allows you to do. And once you have enough passive income to
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.740]   cover your general living expenses, you will keep searching until you find what you're
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:57.800]   looking for. So please be aware that whatever you listen to or read online, try to figure
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.480]   out how much passive income that person has. Are they early retired financially independent
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.640]   because they have passive income that allows them to do what they want? Or are they really
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.480]   just transferring their career to becoming a blogger or podcaster, video, you know, YouTuber,
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.400]   and they're just they just have another job, folks. So it's really important to kind of
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:22.120]   differentiate this. But do not confuse retiring early with doing nothing. In Jerry and Linda's
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.520]   case, they are busy being full time parents, which is harder than any job in the world.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.200]   It's the most important job in the world. And in my case, I'm also trying to be a full
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:36.620]   time dad while continuously writing about personal finance. And I know despite detailing
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:42.520]   the numbers and providing context around Jerry and Linda's financial situation, I'm sure
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.240]   there will continue to be disbelievers that 5 million or more in after tax investments
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.120]   is what's required to live a comfortable but not extravagant lifestyle in a high cost location.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:58.620]   It's become a national pastime to hate the rich, no matter how hard or how long you studied
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.840]   in school, no matter how many hours you've worked, and no matter how many risks you've
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.000]   taken to provide a better life for your family. You know, when the downturn happened in, say,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.720]   the recent one, October 10th and 11th, you know, the people who are going to be winners,
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:19.920]   probably the ones going to say, Hmm, let's, let's buy something, let's buy that stock,
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.640]   or you know, the index that we've been waiting on, and then hopefully in 10 years, things
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.000]   will be higher. But the people who are going to be left behind are the ones who say, I'm
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.600]   not going to take any risk, I'm too scared, and I don't want to do any research or anything.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:39.560]   And it's just much easier to hate on people. And it's, it's normal, it's normal to not
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:46.280]   like or dislike or hate what you do not understand. So hopefully this podcast and this post will
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:54.320]   help, you know, broaden people's perspectives who don't live in high cost of area, places,
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.220]   you know, just like how more international travel and the mastery of a second language
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:04.000]   can help to create more harmony around the world. Hopefully this article and podcast
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.340]   will do the same. And finally, I just want to reiterate once again, not everybody can
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.720]   and will retire early and not everybody should retire early. If you found a job that you
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.280]   love, just keep doing it. Be blessed, thank the Lord that you found something that you'd
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.680]   be willing to do for much less or even for free. I think most people are disengaged from
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:32.840]   work. So please, please keep on building your savings, your investment portfolio, to provide
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:37.000]   yourself options in the future, just in case, you know, you suddenly say I want to do something
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.960]   else. And hopefully everybody can open their minds and appreciate this podcast and this
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.240]   post. Thanks so much, everyone.
