[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   [Music]
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.700]   Well, cultural support for homosexual relationships and for so-called gay marriage
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.600]   is very strong today, as strong as it's ever been in the United States,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.500]   and for Christians who are resolved to resist
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.800]   the incredible pressures of pop culture conformity.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.700]   We are certain to face ridicule and even various expressions of intolerance for our position.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.000]   And that leads us to today's question from a concerned dad, Jason, in Toledo, Ohio, who writes in,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800]   "Pastor John, what advice might you have for my two high school-aged daughters
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.300]   as they experience ridicule for speaking out against homosexuality?"
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.200]   What would you say to them, Pastor John?
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:55.800]   The advice I have is to give them eight biblical reasons that they should be thrilled.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.400]   [Laughs]
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.800]   Glad and rejoice that they have the grace of God working in their lives
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.600]   to stand for truth and for love the way they're standing.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.300]   And here are my eight encouragements.
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.600]   And if they feel right now, maybe they're listening, I don't know,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.300]   that it doesn't make them happy to be made fun of, I get that.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.000]   I feel that nobody likes to be made fun of in our natural capacities.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.800]   But let these eight words from God transform your emotional priorities
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.700]   so that you really are able to do this miracle.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.100]   Number one, Jesus, the Lord of the universe, promised you
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.300]   it would come to you just the same way it came to him, because you're following him.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.800]   So Matthew 10, 25, "If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul,"
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.300]   that is the devil, if they call Jesus the devil,
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.500]   "how much more will they malign, ridicule, make fun of, insult those of his household?"
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.100]   So when this happens to you, it's a confirmation.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.500]   You're in his house and you have a wonderful partner in your misery.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.700]   He's glorious.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.400]   Number two, you are in great company with apostles and prophets.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.800]   Acts 5, 41, "The apostles left the presence of the council rejoicing
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.400]   that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name."
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.100]   Boy, if you could come out of a situation where you had been shamed for the name
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.700]   and you could look at Peter and John in the face as they were rejoicing,
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.900]   you would feel such a glorious camaraderie.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.600]   It would make you glad.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.100]   Number three, you do not know if the ridicule is the last word from these people
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.900]   or if God may use your courage and your love and your devotion to truth to change them.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.100]   And I say that because in the first epistle of Peter, you seem to get that kind of change.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.500]   Chapter 3, verse 16 says, "Have a good conscience so that when you are slandered,
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   those who reviled your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame."
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.300]   So you're hoping that they will be led to be ashamed of their criticism.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.300]   And then it says in chapter 2, verse 12, "Keep your conduct among the Gentiles
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.000]   honorable so that when they speak against you," so there you've got them
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.100]   speaking against you as evildoers, "they may see your good deeds and glorify God
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.600]   on the day of visitation."
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   So it pictures something, something begins with evil speaking and ridicule and insult,
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.500]   and then they see something about you.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.000]   They see how kind you are and loving you are and faithful you are and courageous you are
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.600]   and something triggers by God's grace in their heart and they switch.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   Don't assume that the ridicule is the last word.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:14.200]   Number four, there is a special blessing from the Holy Spirit for those who bear
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.900]   the ridicule for the name of Christ and for the truth that he calls us to stand for.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:29.500]   1 Peter 4, 14, "If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.700]   because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you."
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.900]   I really believe that means there is a special anointing, a special presence,
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:51.400]   a special ministry of the Holy Spirit given to those whom he gives grace to stand like that.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:59.300]   Number five, there is a great reward coming to you because you bear reviling
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.400]   for the name of Jesus.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.800]   Chapter 5 of Matthew, verse 11, "Blessed are you when others revile you and
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.600]   persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account."
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.900]   They say things about you that are not true.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:21.600]   Verse 12, "Rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for so they
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.500]   persecuted the prophets who were before you."
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.300]   There is a great reward awaiting you that will make up ten thousandfold
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.300]   for anything you lost here.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.100]   Number six, God may be preparing you.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.000]   I say this especially to young people because these are teenagers I gather
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   and they might feel like, "Good night.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.800]   My whole world, my whole life is undone because all my friends are turning against me."
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:55.900]   So number six is God may be preparing you for some remarkably greater purpose
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.900]   in this world, greater than you can dream.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.000]   Here's where I get that.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.600]   James chapter 1, verse 2, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.800]   of various kinds."
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.300]   Why?
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.000]   Why should you count it as joy?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.200]   "For you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness."
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   What does that mean?
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.700]   It's like a muscle.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:30.000]   I mean, why do we go to the gym and pick up heavy weights that put our bicepsâ€”
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.200]   I'm holding my bicep right now, so I wish you could see my illustration.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.600]   I'm flexing it now with 10, 20, 30 pounds, whatever I could do in that arm,
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.400]   and it's making my bicep hurt just like trials make us hurt, make our faith hurt.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.600]   Why?
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:55.000]   Because that makes the bicep stronger so that when you need to lift a car
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.400]   off of your sister, you'll be able to do it.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.600]   And so it is with your faith.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.200]   When Jesus does these things to us, he lets people come at us this way,
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   he's preparing us for something.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.800]   So you young people, dream your dream of what this steadfastness and this muscular
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.500]   Christianity that you're developing might enable you to do someday.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.000]   Number seven, God is absolutely sovereign over the world, and he will accomplish
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   all his purpose.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.500]   Don't be afraid that right now you look like you're on the losing end.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.600]   You're not.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   Isaiah 46, 9, "I am God, there is no other.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.400]   I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning,
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:46.200]   and from ancient times, things not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand,
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.800]   and I will accomplish all my purpose.'"
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.200]   You do not need to be afraid that God will fail to bring about his purpose.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:00.400]   And finally, number eight, with all that authority, Jesus promises to be with you
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.700]   personally, intimately, close enough to count the hairs on your head.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.100]   "Behold, I am with you to the end of the age."
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.400]   So I say to these young people, be encouraged.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:21.800]   Do not become sullen or self-pitying or defeatist or defensive.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   Jesus said amazingly, "Rejoice and be glad."
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:34.700]   And I know that sounds virtually impossible, but let these truths sink in,
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:40.900]   and you will see that it makes sense, that joy makes sense, and the Holy Spirit
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.800]   will work it in your heart.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.500]   We really should be, we Christians, with that amazing hope,
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.800]   we should be the happiest people in the world.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.500]   Amen. Those are golden promises for students, Pastor John.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.600]   Thank you.

[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Well, what's the difference between self-love and self-esteem?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.900]   There is a difference, and John Piper will explain how to distinguish the two tomorrow.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
