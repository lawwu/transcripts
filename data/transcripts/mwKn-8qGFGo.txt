[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   are to be found in the chapter read to us, namely the first chapter of the second epistle of Peter,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   reading again the first verse.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   The first verse in the first chapter of the second epistle of Peter.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   "Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   to them that have obtained like precious faith with us
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Now here is the apostle Peter, who has become an old man,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   writing his last letter.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   And he writes it to a number of Christian people.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And he writes to them because he has heard that they're in trouble,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   that they're disturbed, that they're unhappy.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And his object in writing to them is to help them, to comfort them, and to encourage them,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   and to establish them in the faith.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Now he makes it quite clear that there were a number of reasons for this condition
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   in which these people were to be found.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   One is that they themselves had been somewhat negligent.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   They'd come into the Christian life, they were saved men and women,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   but they hadn't been applying themselves unto the teaching.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   That is why you noticed he says in the fifth verse beside this,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   "Giving all diligence, add to your faith, furnish out your faith."
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   It isn't enough merely to have faith.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   If we are to be strong and to grow in the Christian life,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   we must add to this faith, we must furnish it out with certain other qualities.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And he exhorts them to do that, and reprimands them for not doing that.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Now that was one cause of their being in difficulties and in trouble.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   But it wasn't the only one, and indeed it wasn't the chief one.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   These people had been disturbed by certain false teachings.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Now there's nothing new about heresy.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Heresy began almost as soon as the gospel.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Certain false teachers had been creeping in,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   and they had been doing a special damage by casting doubt upon the very person
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   of our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   That is why Peter says in the 16th verse,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   "We have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   They must have listened to these people.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And he reminds them how they must not only believe the testimony of the apostles,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   but also the great testimony of the Old Testament prophecies,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   which have been fulfilled and verified in the coming of the Son of God.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Now this was very disturbing.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Heresy is always disturbing.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And any doubt about the person and work of our blessed Lord and Savior
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   is always devastating in the Christian life.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   So he goes on in the second chapter in the first verse to say,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   "There were false prophets also among the people."
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   He's referring to the Jews in the Old Testament.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   "Even as there shall be false teachers among you,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   who probably shall bring indomitable heresies,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   even denying the Lord that bought them,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   and bring upon themselves swift destruction."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   These teachers were not only denying the person of the Lord,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   but especially denying his atoning death as the only way of salvation.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And as always happens when you get false teaching,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   it soon begins to reflect itself in life and living.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And so he goes on in this second chapter,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   which in many ways is one of the most terrifying chapters in the whole of the Bible,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   to warn these people against the kind of life that was being lived by these false teachers.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   When you lose grip of your doctrine,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   you'll soon lose grip of your morals, and of your conduct, and of your behavior.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So he says of these men that their lives are full of adultery,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and they cannot cease from sin, beguiling unstable souls, and so on.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And sums it all up in language such as this at the end of the chapter.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   "It had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   But it has happened unto them according to the true problem,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   that dog is turned to his own vomit again,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And so apostles spoke of false teachers.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   We've become too polite, my friends.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   These false teachers are to be exposed and to be denounced in unmistakable language.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   These men are the enemies of the cross of Christ.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And that is how this apostle deals with them and describes them.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And then in the third chapter he goes on to point out
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   how these people he knew were being disturbed because of these scoffers
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   who had arisen and were casting doubt upon the great doctrine
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   of the second coming of our Lord and Savior.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   "Here they were standing out and saying, 'Where is the promise of his coming?'
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It was all very well," he says, "for the preachers to preach about the coming of the Son of God
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   to destroy his enemies and to set up his great kingdom, but nothing's happening.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   The years are passing. Where is he?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Is this true or is this some figment of the imagination?"
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Well now, you can see that as the result of all this,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   these people were in a state of considerable unhappiness and rejection.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And it is for that reason that the apostle writes to them.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   "I don't think I need take any time this morning in showing you how opposite
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   this teaching is here in this epistle to our very state and condition at the present time.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Isn't this precisely the condition of the Christian church speaking generally at this very hour?"
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And there are many Christian people who are confused, they're unhappy.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   They don't know exactly where they stand.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   What does the apostle say to them?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Well, it's very interesting to me to notice how he puts it.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   "The great thing," he tells them immediately, "is this,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   that he's got nothing new to give them, nothing new at all.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Indeed, his diagnosis of their condition is this,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   that they are in trouble because they have forgotten what they already knew.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So all he's got to do," he tells them, "is to remind them
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   of the things that they have been tending to forget.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I want to establish this point.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   There are people today who say that in this twentieth century,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   here we are halfway through it and more, that we need a new message.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   In this post-war world, this atomic age, this scientific age,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   that we need a new message, a new gospel, and they're trying to invent one.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   What a travesty that is of the whole of Christian teaching.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   My dear friends, we need nothing new.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   All our troubles are due to the fact that we've forgotten
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   what we once knew and believed.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   All the troubles in the Christian life are ultimately due to forgetfulness
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   of the truth, the doctrine, once and forever delivered to the saints."
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Now, listen to him putting this.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   He says, "If these things be in you and abound,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   But he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and hath forgotten," he's forgotten, "that he was purged from his old sins.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Wherefore, therefore, the honor, brethren, give diligence
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   to make your calling and election sure.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   For if you do these things, you shall never fall."
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   But then, he's so concerned about this, listen to him,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   how he goes on repeating it.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   At the very essence, the whole art of teaching is repetition.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Listen to this in the twelfth verse.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   "Therefore," he says, "I will not be negligent to put you always
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   in remembrance of these things, though you know them,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and be established in the present truth."
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   He says, "You know these things.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   All I've got to do is to remind you of them,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   to put you in remembrance of them."
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   But he's not content with saying it once.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Verse 13, "Yea, I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   to stir you up by putting you in remembrance,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Moreover," here it is again, "I will endeavor that ye may be able
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   after my decease to have these things always in remembrance."
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   He says, "I'm an old man, my end has come.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I know my days are very limited.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   But while I'm here, I'm going to go on repeating these things to you,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   so that after I've gone, you'll remember them,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   and you must never forget them."
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And that is precisely the message of the Scriptures to us this morning.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   You don't need any new gospel.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   My dear friend, if you're in spiritual trouble,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   if you're unhappy, if you're ill at ease,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   if you're afraid of life and death,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   all you need is to remember again the great and glorious verities
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   of this, our grand Christian faith.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And it seems to me that the apostle really sums all this up.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   That's the thesis, that's the teaching.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   He sums it all up in this first verse.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   That's why I'm giving special attention to that.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Simon Peter, "A servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   to them that have obtained like precious faith with us
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ."
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   What is the matter with these people?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I can put it in a phrase.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Their whole trouble was due to the fact
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   that they had not realized the precious character of their faith.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Precious faith.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Now, this was a great word with the apostle Peter.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   It's his favorite word.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   There are some people, some scholars, as they're called,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   who would have us believe that Peter didn't write this second epistle.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I don't agree with them.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Peter betrays that he's the author by using this word "precious."
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   You read the first and second epistles of Peter.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Watch for this word.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   You'll find he was always using it.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   It's obviously his favorite word.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Precious faith.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Something that is beyond price, beyond computation.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Something that you can't assess.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Precious faith.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   And this is what I want to hold before you this morning.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Have you realized, my friend, the precious character of your faith?
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Have you realized that as a Christian, you are the possessor
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   of the most glorious thing in the whole universe?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Something which transcends everything else
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   and causes everything else to pale into insignificance.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Well, now, unless there may be someone here this morning
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   who doesn't quite realize the precious character of this faith,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   let us just look at it and work it out together.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   In what sense is this faith of ours
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   rightly described as being precious, priceless,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   beyond all value and computation?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Well, I think we can deal with this in a very simple manner.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   How do you assess the value of anything that is in your possession?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   We've all got various possessions at home,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   but it's probably true of all of us to say that we've got some one thing
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   which we value above everything else.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   It is our most priceless, precious possession.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   How do you decide that?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   What are the canons of judgment that you apply to anything
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   in order to assess its value?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Well, it's quite a simple procedure.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Let's work it out together.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   One of the first things, surely, we all do with regard to such a possession is this.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   How did I get it?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   How did it come into my possession?
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Where did it come from?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Most important, isn't it?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   We're all familiar with this.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And Peter makes exactly this same point.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   He's writing to those, he says,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   who have obtained light, precious faith with us.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Now, this word "obtained" is a most important and significant word.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Peter obviously selected it and used it deliberately.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   What's its meaning?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Well, the original meaning of this word translated "obtained" is this.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   It was the word that they used in connection with casting lots.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   You know, they wanted to decide who should possess a certain object.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   There were many people who wanted it.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   There were many who were making claims to it.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Now, the question was, to whom shall we give this?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And the only way to decide was to cast lots.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And that was the ancient method.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   It's still employed frequently by people to arrive at such a decision.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Two teams may be playing. Who goes in first?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Well, you decide by spinning a coin.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   So on, it's the same sort of idea.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Now, that's the word that Peter deliberately selected.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   You have obtained light, precious faith.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   What's the implication?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Well, it's very important.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   What he's saying is this, you see,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   that this is something that has come to them.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   When you get something as a result of casting lots, you don't do it.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   It is a decision taken outside you.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And the lot, as it were, decides that this should be yours.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Now, he says, that's how you've got faith.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   This is great Protestant teaching.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   This is the great Protestant doctrine
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   of salvation by grace through faith alone.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   No man makes himself a Christian.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   You don't buy faith by your works or by your activities or by anything else.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   You can't buy it. You can't purchase it.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It's always without money and without price.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   By grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   It is the gift of God.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Now, have you realized this, says Peter, that you've obtained,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   this precious, priceless thing has come to you in that way?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   It seems to me that we need to remember this.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   This year is the 450th anniversary of that great occasion
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   when Martin Luther nailed those 95 theses
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   to the door of that church in Wittenberg.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Let's not forget this.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   The 31st, the great Protestant reformation
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   as over and against the merry teaching of the Church of Rome.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   No, no, a man does nothing about his salvation.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It is the free gift of God.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And you and I but obtain it.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   It comes to us. It is given to us.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And this immediately makes it precious.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   But wait a minute. There is something still more important.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Who has given us this gift?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Now, you employ this, don't you, in ordinary life.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   What really makes certain possessions that you have
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   of exceptional value in your esteem
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   is that you have been given this thing by some particular person.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I don't know whether you get this sort of thing here,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   but often in Britain you'll read in a newspaper
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   rather a plaintive appeal.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And this is the nature of the appeal.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Burglars, thieves broke into the house
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   or into the car of certain people a day or two back.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   And they've taken a number of things.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   They've taken a lot of money.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   They've taken a lot of other possessions.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   But now this letter appears, or this appeal appears in the paper.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   And it's an appeal by the people who've been robbed
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   or the person who's been robbed to these thieves.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   And this is what the appeal says.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   It says, "Now you've taken a number of things.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   You've taken money and many other things.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   All right, I'm not worried about them.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I'm not concerned about them.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   But you know, you have taken one thing
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   which to you will be quite valueless.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   You'll get nothing for it.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   But to me, it was the most precious thing in my possession."
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Why?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Well, this thing had been given to me
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   by some loved one and by some dear one.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I remember one instance of parents making this appeal.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And this was--these were the grounds of their appeal.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   This little thing that had been taken by the thieves
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   was really, from the standpoint of money, virtually valueless.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   But it did happen to be the first gift
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   that their only son had ever given them.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   He'd been killed in the war.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   But when he was a little boy, he had saved his little money
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   and he'd gone into a shop on his own
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   and he'd bought a present for his father and mother.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And they'd kept it, of course, ever since.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   It was the most precious thing in their possession.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   It had been stolen.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   It's valueless to the thieves,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   but to the father and mother,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   it's the most precious thing in the universe.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Why?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Given them by this darling boy
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   who'd been killed in the war.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Now, that's the kind of argument the apostle is using.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   "To them that have obtained like precious faith with us,"
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   who's given it?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   "Through the righteousness of God."
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   It's God who's given it?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   My dear Christian friends, what's the matter with us?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Some of us are apologetic for the faith
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   and half ashamed of the fact that we're Christians.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Shame on us.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Don't you realize that if you're a Christian this morning,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   you're a Christian because God, the almighty God,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   has chosen to give you this gift of faith?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   It's God who's given it.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   It is the gift of God.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And you notice the apostle is very careful to point out
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   the way whereby God has contrived to give us this gift.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   This gift of faith that God has given us
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   has cost God tremendously
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   through the righteousness of God
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   and our savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   What does it mean?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Well, it means this.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I say it with reference.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   There are people who say today,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   "People who deny the atonement and the work of Christ,"
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   they say there's no difficulty.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   God is love.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   As if to say God can do this, give forgiveness,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   no trouble, no problem.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   It isn't true, my friends.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   To forgive any one of us has cost God tremendously.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   For God is not only love, he is righteousness, he is truth.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   God is holy.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And God can only give us this gift in a righteous manner.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   And there is only one way whereby it was possible.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Through the righteousness of God and our savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Peter has said all this in the first epistle.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   "Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   as silver and gold from your vain conversation
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   received by tradition from your fathers,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   but with the precious blood of Christ,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   This is what it cost God to give you faith.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   He had to avert his face from his only begotten, dearly beloved son,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   on whom he'd laid your sins, and he was punishing them.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   It cost him that.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And it cost the son of God his own precious blood.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   What a gift is this gift of faith, this thing that you've got.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   It cost the blood of the son of God when he was in the flesh.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   This is what makes this faith of ours so exceedingly precious.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   But that's not the only test that we apply in these matters, is it?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   What's the next test that you tend to apply
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   in order to determine the value or the preciousness of anything?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Well, I think you'll agree that another very common test is this one.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   The rarity.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   If a thing is rare, it always becomes more valuable.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   This is something, again, with which we are all familiar.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   A thing which is common is generally cheap.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   But if a thing becomes scarce or rare, correspondingly, it becomes valuable.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I believe I was saying here one of these last three nights
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   that of a case where a man was selling a picture in Sotheby's in London
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   and got a great price for it when it was discovered
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   that it was a painting by one of the great masters.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And that is the case.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   You get cases of that happening quite frequently.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   But let me perhaps illustrate this to you by an incident
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   which happened in my own experience some three or four years ago.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I was preaching in a place, due to preach in a place,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   on a Thursday afternoon and evening,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   and I'd had to travel a very long distance on the Wednesday night
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   from a previous engagement to get to this place for the Thursday.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And I was put to stay with some friends and had a good night's rest,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   got up in the morning and having had breakfast,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   my host and I were sitting in a room.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And suddenly I found myself looking at a cabinet in his room.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And in the cabinet I could see most beautiful china.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   And he observed that I was looking at it with interest.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   He said, "Are you interested?"
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Well, I said, "I don't know much about this sort of thing,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   but it looks very beautiful to me."
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   "Oh, come and see it," he said.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   And he took me and told me about each single piece of china in his cabinet.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Now, this happened to be what is known in our country as "Swansea China."
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And it was very beautiful.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   And then he began to tell me the value of each piece.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   There was one plate, I remember quite distinctly.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   He said, "I've already refused 1,100 pounds for that."
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Over $3,000, one plate.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And then he gave me the price of the other pieces.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Now, why is this Swansea China so valuable, so highly priced?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   The answer is perfectly simple.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   The firm that made that china only existed for three years,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   from 1815 to 1880.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Then they became bankrupt.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   The quality was too good and the price was not sufficient.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   The firm went out of existence.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   The firm that made every single known piece of Swansea China
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   only was in existence for three years.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   The result is, of course, that after the passing of 150 years
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   and breakages and so on, this has become extremely rare and scarce.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And the result is, it has become very precious and of very great price.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Now, the apostle Peter, you see, makes exactly the same point.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   The scripture makes this point everywhere.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Why is this faith of ours so precious?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   My dear friends, one of the answers is that it is so rare.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   You read in the Old Testament,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   "The word of the Lord was precious in those days.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   There was no open vision."
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   When was that?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Well, those were in the days before Samuel became a great prophet in Israel.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   A day of great degeneracy, religiously, morally, militarily, and in every other respect.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   The word of the Lord was precious in those days.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   There was no open vision.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   But when it came, oh, how they paid attention to it.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And you remember a word in the prophet Amos,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   God threatening the disobedient generation of people.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   He said, "Behold, the days come when I shall send a famine in this land,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   not a famine of eating bread or of drinking water,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord."
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   That's the most terrible thing that can ever happen to a nation or a people.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   To lack food, to lack drink is terrible, but there's something worse.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   No word from God.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Just to be left to ourselves and our own resources.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   I'm not sure that we're not experiencing something of that at the present time.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   The Lord withholding his precious word because of our rebellion and our disobedience.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Now, this you see is something that is emphasized.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Take our Lord's way of putting it.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   "Enter ye in," he says, "at the straight gate.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   For wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And many there be that go in thereat,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And few, few there be that find it."
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   That's what our Lord himself said.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And isn't that being verified today?
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   I know many Christian people who seem to be very alarmed and troubled and dejected
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   because Christian people are few in number today.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And they're frightened by this.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   The crowd, the great people, the scientists and all the rest are going the other way.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And these Christians are timorous and they're frightened.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   My dear friend, you must learn to think again.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   You ought to look at that the other way around.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Aren't you proud of the fact that you're one of the select band at a time like this?
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   How rare is true faith.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Few there be that find it.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Many there be that go in thereat the other way.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Every fool denies the gospel.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   The crowds are going to drink, drugs, bingo, gambling, everything else, godlessness.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   The crowd!
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Why? Because it's so easy.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   You just drift down the stream.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Few there be that find it.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Precious faith.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   This is what makes it precious.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   It is so rare.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   But wait, I can add to that.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   What makes it still more precious is this.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Is the character of this select company that possesses the faith.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   You see, they're not only few in number, but oh, what a wonderful people they are who do have it.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Let me explain immediately what I mean by going on with my story about my friend who entertained me.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   He showed me the contents of that cabinet, then he got another and yet another.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And he was so proud of his collection of Swansea china.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   And having shown me all the individual pieces, he pulled out a key from his pocket and went to another cabinet and opened it very carefully.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And produced the most beautiful vial, bound in vellum.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And he placed it on a little table.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And he opened it very carefully at a particular page.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And he told me, he said, this is a book which contains photographs and a brief description of every known piece of Swansea china and tells you the name of the owner.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And this was the source of his pride, you see.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   His name was in that book.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Yes, but at the particular page that he opened, this was what happened.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   On the left hand side, I saw photographs of some of the pieces I'd already seen.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And at the bottom it said, these are in the possession of Mr. So-and-so.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   On the other page, there were photographs of other pieces of Swansea china.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   These are in the possession of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   And this was the thing that really thrilled this man.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Not only were the pieces of china intrinsically of great value, not only was he proud to have his name in this great book,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   but you see, because he possessed pieces of Swansea china, he belongs to this exclusive circle that includes the Queen of England.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   This is the thing that makes it precious and valuable.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   This is the thing that thrills him.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   It's scarce, it's rare, few people have it.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   But yes, who are they?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Well, they're people like the Queen of England.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   You know, the Apostle Peter has anticipated all that, have you noticed it?
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   To them that have obtained like precious faith with us.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Who is this us?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Well, that's the apostles.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   You know, says Peter to these people, I can't quite understand you.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I can't quite understand the miserable Christians, says Peter.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   I can't understand anybody who's uncertain of the faith or not proud of it.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   I can't understand anybody who's afraid of death or afraid of persecution because you're a Christian.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   He says, don't you realize the company to which you belong?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Like precious faith with us.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   The apostles.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Who are these people?
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Well, if you read the first epistle, you'll find that Peter didn't even know who they were.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   They're described as strangers scattered abroad throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Bithynia, Galatia, and so on.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   He didn't even know them.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   They were the most ordinary people in the world.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   But, says Peter, don't you realize that because you've obtained and have received this gift of precious faith,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   you belong to the same company as my brother apostles and I.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   He says, you know, you belong to the same company as that mighty man Paul.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   In the third chapter, Peter confesses that he doesn't understand everything that Paul wrote.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   He says in his letters there are some things which are hard to be understood.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Paul was a great intellectual genius.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Peter wasn't.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And he says, I mean, I find it a little bit difficult to understand it, but you know, he says,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   because you've got faith, you belong to the same company as the mighty Paul.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Paul didn't say it himself.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Paul obtained the gift of faith in exactly the same way as you have.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   He got it, he was given it on the road to Damascus.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   He didn't earn it, he didn't win it, and you haven't.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   He's been given it as a free gift of God so have you.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   You've got like, precious faith with us.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Oh, Christian people, we ought in one sense and in a right sense and in a true sense
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   to be the proudest people in the world this morning.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Not as the Pharisees were.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   They were proud of their own deeds and actions, proud of their own knowledge, not that.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   We should be proud because we belong to this company.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Do you know to whom you belong this morning?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Are you troubled because the great people of the world are outside the church
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   and we seem to be a remnant of insignificant people?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Are you downcast because of that?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Think again.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Do you know who your company is?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   You belong to Abel.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   You belong to Noah.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   You belong to Abraham and the mighty patriarchs.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   You belong to Samuel.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   You belong to Elijah.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   You belong to David and the mighty list of prophets.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   That's your company.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   You belong to these apostles.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   You've been given exactly the same faith as these mighty men of God.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   You belong to those great martyrs and confessors of the first centuries.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   You belong, my dear friends, to the Protestant reformers,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Luther, Kelvin, Knox and the rest of them.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   You belong to the great Puritans, the great covenanters of Scotland,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   the early great Methodist fathers.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   That's your company.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   How can we be dejected?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   How can we be uncertain?
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   We have obtained like precious faith with them.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   I often like to think of this in terms of a verse of a very well-known hymn.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   You're familiar with it.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Art thou weary, art thou languid, art thou sore distressed?
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   It's the last verse I like.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Finding, following, keeping, struggling.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   That's our position, isn't it?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Is he sure to bless?
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   This is what the poor, weary saint asks, weary and languid.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Oh, it's a hard fight, we say.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Finding, following, keeping, struggling.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Is he sure to bless?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Can I rely upon the fact that he won't forget me and that he'll bless me?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Is he certain to bless me?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Can I rely upon him?
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Is he sure to bless?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   You remember the answer.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Saints, apostles, prophets, martyrs, answered.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Yes!
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Can't you hear them this morning, the saints in glory?
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Saints, apostles, prophets, martyrs.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Can't you hear the heavenly choir shouting out its eternal answer?
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And it is yes!
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Trust him.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   He will never leave you nor forsake you.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   That's what makes this so precious.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   We belong to the glorious company of the apostles.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   I mustn't keep you, my dear friends, although obviously with a theme like this I could.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   We are considering the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Let me give you just one final thought to work out for yourselves.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Why is this faith so precious?
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   The answer is because of what it does for us.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   What is faith?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Well, you know, faith, according to this definition, and I like it,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   is some kind of a golden key that God gives us
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   that enables us to unlock the door
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   that leads into God's eternal treasure house, treasure store.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   There in Christ he has treasured up for us all the treasures and the wealth
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   of his wisdom and his knowledge and everything else.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And it is endless, it is illimitable.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   It's all there.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   But you don't know anything about it and you don't partake of it,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   you don't share of it,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   unless you've got this key that opens the door and gives you admission.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   That's what faith is.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Faith is the key giving you admission to the treasure house of God.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   And what has he got for you?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Well, it's all here.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   This blessed forgiveness of which I have spoken by the precious blood of Christ,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   sins forgiven, blotted out, erased from the eternal books,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   reconciled to God, having access to God,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   able to pray to him as my Father,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   able to leave myself in his hands,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   knowing this, and it's true,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   that all things work together for good to them that love God,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   even to them who are called according to his purpose.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   It doesn't matter where I am, nor however hazardous the position.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   If I'm in God's hands I am safe.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Nothing can touch me.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   That's what I know. It is true.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   It's the teaching of the scriptures everywhere.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Not only that, did you notice this?
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   In the fourth verse, "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   What a wonderful thing it is at a time like this,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   with the corruption that we see around and about us,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   the lust, the tragedy,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   that you and I should have been taken out of it and saved from it,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   and washed and cleansed and sanctified.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   What a glorious thing it is.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   It's all by faith.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   But above and beyond that,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   "partakers of the divine nature."
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   It is faith that reveals all this to me.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Because, you see, it enables me to see
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   who the Lord Jesus Christ is and what he's done.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Peter says here, now you take my word for it,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   I was with Peter and I was with James and John on the Mount of Transfiguration,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   and we heard the word that came from heaven saying,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   But don't only take my word for it.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Believe the prophets and then the Spirit will come and seal it to you,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   and you'll know, rest in it, confide in it,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   make your calling and election sure.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And finally, this is a wonderful thing,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   "Wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   For if ye do these things, you shall never fall then.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   For so, an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   This is the most wonderful thing of all about faith.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   It enables you to die gloriously.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   An abundant entry.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   You're not merely shuffled out of life.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   You don't merely die like a dog.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   No, no.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   The gates of heaven will be flung wide open.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   An abundant entry.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Or if you prefer it in other terms,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   the great eternal heaven will be ready to receive you,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and your little bark will go in,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   and the trumpets will be sounding,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   and the angels will be singing.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   An abundant entrance
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   may be administered unto you
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   My dear friend,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   have you realized the precious character of your faith?
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Aren't you rather ashamed of your apologetic attitude?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Aren't you going to go out of this church with your head erect,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   a child of God,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   belonging to this glorious company,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   the General Assembly and the Church of the Firstborn,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   the spirits of just men made perfect?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   That's the company you belong to.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Let the world deride or pity.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   I will glory in his name,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   obtained like precious faith with us
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   through the righteousness of God
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   and of our Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Amen.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
