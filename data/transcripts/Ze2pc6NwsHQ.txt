[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.140]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.900]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.740]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.220]   Today, we're going to talk all about
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.840]   how to optimize your workspace for maximum productivity.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.780]   Indeed, that means to heighten levels of focus,
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.080]   to increase levels of creativity,
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.500]   to improve your ability to task switch.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.980]   And this could be for, say, go school or for work,
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.240]   creative endeavors, personal endeavors.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.080]   This really extends to everybody.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.240]   Most often, when we hear about how to focus
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.020]   or how to get the most out of our work sessions,
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.480]   we hear about the biology and the psychology of that.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.920]   We hear about dopamine, and we hear about serotonin,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.380]   and we hear about caffeine.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.420]   And indeed, those are topics that I've covered a lot
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.100]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740]   Today, we will touch on each of those,
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.580]   but we are mainly going to focus on
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.100]   how we arrange our physical environment,
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040]   and indeed, how we arrange ourselves
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.540]   in that physical environment
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.700]   in order to bring out the best in our neurobiology.
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.300]   That is, how to put ourselves into a heightened state
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.820]   of focus by virtue of things as simple as
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.620]   where we place our screen relative to our eyes
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.900]   at a given time of day.
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.100]   Believe it or not, there's excellent research on this,
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.900]   and there's excellent research, for instance,
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260]   on whether or not you should or should not listen to music,
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.020]   whether or not you should use things like binaural beats,
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.300]   and if so, what frequency of binaural beats.
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.820]   We are going to cover all of that.
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.080]   And by the end, you will have a checklist of things
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.200]   that you can do to optimize your workspace on any budget.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.980]   I will mention various products and apps
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.420]   that some of you might find useful
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.500]   for optimizing your workspace,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.100]   but I want to emphasize at the outset
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460]   that none of those that I mentioned
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.940]   are any products or apps
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.900]   that we have a financial relationship to.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.340]   And more importantly, you don't need them.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.140]   I'm going to explain how, for zero cost,
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.060]   you can arrange your workspace in ways
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.340]   that makes you maximally productive, maximally focused,
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.620]   and allows you to adapt your workspace
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.560]   to different environments, whether or not you're traveling,
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.140]   working with others, working alone, et cetera.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.380]   Just to give you a little hint of where we are going,
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.980]   I will mention a zero cost app
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.340]   that will deliver binaural beats at a particular frequency
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.480]   that peer-reviewed research has shown
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.880]   can enhance certain types of learning and memory.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.420]   However, peer-reviewed research also shows
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.980]   that it can diminish performance in other types of tasks.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.060]   So stay tuned, we'll go into all the details
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.220]   so that you can optimize your workspace
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.660]   for zero cost and get the most out of your efforts
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.900]   and endeavors.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.480]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.280]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.340]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.920]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.500]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.540]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.460]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.580]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.460]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.340]   that has everything you need
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.700]   and none of the things you don't.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.720]   And when we say everything you need,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.940]   the main one is salt.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.760]   Now, salt, AKA sodium, has kind of a bad rap.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.340]   We've all heard that too much salt is bad for us.
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.080]   However, if you look into the research on salt,
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.260]   and in fact, if you go to one of the highest level
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.520]   peer-reviewed scientific publications, Science Magazine,
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.780]   you can find a review article in Science some years ago
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.020]   that shows that most of what we think and understand
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.400]   about the science of salt is completely wrong.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.220]   And in fact, salt does a number of things
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.400]   that's extremely important.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.540]   For instance, our neurons,
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.820]   which signal to one another through electricity
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.260]   and through chemical signaling,
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.200]   critically rely on having enough sodium
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.340]   in order to generate what we call action potentials
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.900]   or electrical firing of neurons.
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.360]   If your sodium levels are too low,
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.340]   your neurons simply won't work.
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.160]   One of the main deficits from being dehydrated
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.540]   is lack of sodium, not just lack of water.
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.360]   Getting sufficient sodium does a number of things
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.380]   that's very important.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.860]   It can raise your blood volume.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.780]   It can help you retain water in a healthy way,
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.920]   not excess amounts.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.260]   It allows neurons to fire for sake of thinking,
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.540]   for sake of athletic performance and so on.
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.340]   Other electrolytes that are in Element
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.400]   are things like magnesium and potassium,
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.460]   which are also essential for neuronal function
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.920]   and indeed all organ function.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.460]   Element has a lot of salt, some magnesium and some potassium.
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.300]   So unless you're somebody
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.040]   who really has chronic hypertension,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   elevating your level of salt intake can often be beneficial.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.260]   You should check with your doctor,
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.600]   but indeed it can often be beneficial.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.340]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.020]   of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.580]   200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.560]   It tastes delicious.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.580]   I happen to like the raspberry or citrus flavors.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.200]   In fact, I like all of the flavors.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.780]   Put in some water.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.560]   You can make it as dense,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.760]   meaning as high concentration as you like.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.640]   So some people will put it in eight ounces of water.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.380]   I like mine in about 16 ounces of water
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.500]   and I'll drink that before and after exercise.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.460]   And I usually will have another one throughout the day,
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.880]   just sip on it as I'm doing work and so forth.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.100]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.940]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.580]   spelled drinklmnt.com/huberman

[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.000]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.300]   now referred to as AG1.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.420]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.740]   And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.340]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.140]   and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.140]   is that it helps me meet
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.220]   all of my foundational vitamin, mineral and probiotic needs.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.220]   And when people ask me,
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.100]   what's the one supplement I should take?
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.820]   If they were to only take one supplement,
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.700]   I always recommend AG1 for the simple reason
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.940]   that vitamins, the minerals and the probiotics
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.100]   support metabolic health, they support endocrine health,
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.380]   they support brain health,
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.400]   and the probiotics and prebiotics in there in particular
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.740]   support the so-called gut brain axis.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.780]   There is now a plethora of data supporting the fact
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.960]   that when we have a healthy gut microbiome,
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.460]   that is little microbes that live in our gut
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.820]   that are good for us,
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.180]   our gut signals to our brain
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.500]   and our brain signals back to our gut
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.180]   in ways that support our immune system,
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.540]   our digestion, even our mood.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.100]   They can even support healthy levels of dopamine signaling,
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.260]   an important molecule for motivation
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.760]   and high levels of mood or positive mood.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.120]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.320]   Vitamin D3K2 has been shown to be important
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.140]   for metabolic health, endocrine health,
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.000]   and K2 in particular for heart health
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.580]   and regulating appropriate amounts of calcium in your bones.

[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.140]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Theragun.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.140]   Theragun is a handheld percussive device
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.560]   that releases deep muscle tension.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.380]   I was first introduced to Theragun on a shark diving trip.
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.900]   We were way out in the Pacific filming great white sharks
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.620]   for my laboratory where we study fear.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.540]   And everyone was diving all day
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.400]   carrying what are called pelican cases,
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.180]   which aren't actual pelicans with wings,
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.540]   but cases for these cameras.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.860]   They're very heavy.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.940]   We're moving things all day.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.740]   We're working really hard.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.740]   We got really sore.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.460]   I got particularly sore from all that physical labor.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.860]   Someone brought a Theragun along.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.120]   I'd never seen one of these things before or tried one.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.300]   And I spent the rest of the trip
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.460]   trying to get as much time with the Theragun as I could,
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.700]   at least when I was on board the boat.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.820]   With Theragun, you can get what is effectively
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.700]   a deep tissue massage to any area of your body.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.340]   And you can just do that for minutes or hours
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.180]   for as long as you like.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.220]   It's really wonderful.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.660]   If you have someone else there who's willing to use
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.940]   the Theragun on hard to reach places like your back,
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.220]   that's even better.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.660]   Whether or not you want to treat muscle tension
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.060]   from working out, an injury,
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.580]   or just deal with daily stress from everyday life,
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.500]   there's really no substitute for the Theragun.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.180]   You know, professional massage is wonderful,
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.660]   but a professional massage, of course,
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.340]   involves going to a masseuse.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.980]   It's quite expensive often, et cetera.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.620]   If you're interested in getting a Theragun,
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.060]   they start at only $199.

[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.040]   Let's talk about workspace optimization.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.460]   This is a topic that's intrigued me for a very long time
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.640]   because my undergraduate advisor, my graduate advisor,
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.020]   and my postdoc advisor had many things in common,
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.760]   including being great scientists,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.900]   being kind people and terrific mentors,
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.260]   but they had another thing in common
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.800]   which always perplexed me,
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.160]   which is that their offices were a complete disaster.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.520]   They had mountains of books, mountains of papers,
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.220]   mountains of all sorts of stuff,
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.400]   and yet all of them were extremely productive
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.240]   and could remain extremely focused
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.720]   in that incredibly cluttered environment.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.380]   Now, I'm somebody who doesn't like clutter.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.080]   I find it very hard to focus in cluttered environments.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.040]   And indeed there's tremendous variation among people
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.780]   as to whether or not they can remain focused
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.160]   or whether or not they struggle to focus
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.540]   in physically cluttered environments.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.220]   There's no right or wrong to this,
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.580]   but the question we should ask ourselves is,
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.180]   why were they all able to be so focused?
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.260]   And it turns out that the reason
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.500]   they were able to be so focused
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.560]   is that they all captured one single
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.140]   and yet fundamental variable of workspace optimization.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.260]   And we'll talk about what that variable is.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.780]   In fact, we're going to talk about
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.620]   what all the variables of optimizing a workspace are.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.420]   Things like vision, things like light,
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.800]   things like noise in the room,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.380]   whether or not you listen to music or not,
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.860]   whether or not you use noise canceling headphones or not.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.880]   We're going to talk about all of that.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.020]   And we're going to do that in a way
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.660]   that you can optimize your workspace
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.680]   regardless of whether or not you are at home,
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.800]   whether or not you're on the road, et cetera.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.220]   Because the last thing I would ever want to do
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.620]   is to create a situation where you find
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.380]   the optimal workspace and then you are a slave
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.600]   to that optimal workspace.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.080]   That's just not the way the world works.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.920]   What you want to do, or my goal for you rather,
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.820]   is that you will have a short checklist of things
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.860]   that you can look to anytime you sit down to do work.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.300]   And you can think about the underlying variables
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.460]   that impact your brain and your body
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.340]   and allow your brain and body to get into the optimal state
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.180]   in order to learn, in order to be productive,
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.220]   and the need to move through your workouts
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.320]   in a very relaxed and pleasureful way
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.920]   while maintaining focus and while pursuing
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.700]   any of the number of things that you're doing.
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.860]   The first variable we want to think about
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.240]   in terms of workspace optimization is vision and light.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.360]   Now, on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.560]   devoted all to habits, I talked about the importance
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.120]   of dividing your 24 hour day into three different phases.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.320]   And for those of you that haven't heard that episode,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.380]   I'm just going to briefly summarize what I described.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.300]   From the time you wake up in the morning
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.880]   until about six or seven or eight,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.160]   sometimes nine hours later, your brain is in a unique state.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.220]   It is in a state of high levels of dopamine,
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.120]   a neuromodulator, and high levels of epinephrine,
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.820]   as well as hormones like cortisol and so forth.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.100]   Without going into the biology of those things,
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.920]   they set your brain into a state of high alertness.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.120]   And this is true whether or not you indulge
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.720]   in caffeine or not.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.560]   I know some of you say,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.440]   oh, I really don't wake up until the afternoon.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.260]   I'm much more alert and focused in the afternoon.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.400]   We will talk about that phase of the 24 hour day
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.360]   in a moment.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.120]   But that early part of the day is a time of day
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.040]   in which for sake of workspace optimization,
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.520]   being in a brightly lit environment can lend itself
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.720]   to optimal work throughout the day,
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.600]   not just during that early phase.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.440]   And so while on many episodes of this podcast,
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.900]   I've also emphasized the importance
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.620]   of getting morning sunlight in your eyes
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.500]   within 30 to 60 minutes of waking.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.560]   Not as often, but now and again,
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.500]   I will also mention that it's important
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.120]   to light your daytime environment
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.520]   as brightly as you safely can.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.240]   So if you are going to be doing work in this early,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.640]   what I call phase one portion of your day,
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.200]   you want to have as much light
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   and indeed as much overhead light shining on you
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.840]   as safely possible.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.600]   Now, of course, you don't want it so bright
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.200]   that it's glaring and you have to squint, et cetera,
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.040]   but you want as much light as is safely possible.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.000]   And you can do that a couple of simple ways.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.520]   One is if you do own or you're in an environment
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.620]   where you have overhead lights,
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.520]   turn on those overhead lights.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.780]   What's special about overhead lights for setting alertness
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.840]   is that the neurons in our eyes,
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.820]   which are called melanopsin ganglion cells,
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.160]   that's the fancy name, melanopsin ganglion cells
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.780]   are mainly enriched in the lower half of our retinas,
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.740]   in our eyes and view the upper visual field.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.720]   Those neurons send little wires
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.080]   to an area of our hypothalamus
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.680]   right above the roof of our mouth
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.280]   that creates a state of alertness.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.200]   Now, early in the day, we want to be as alert as possible.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.400]   And this phase one of our circadian cycle
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   is when we are best at doing analytic detail type work.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.740]   So we're going to go into other aspects
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.840]   of workspace optimization that are important for phase one.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.960]   But during phase one, again,
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.760]   within zero to about eight or nine hours after waking,
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.480]   bright lights in your environment,
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.600]   in particular overhead lights are going to facilitate focus.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.740]   They're going to facilitate further release
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.160]   of things like dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.920]   and healthy amounts of cortisol.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.020]   And we want that to happen early in the day
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.420]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.140]   For instance, we don't want that cortisol peak
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.020]   to happen too late in the day.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.240]   That's actually associated with depression and insomnia
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.340]   and a number of things that we just don't want.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.940]   So one of the things that I've done for my workspace
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.080]   is to make sure that when I wake up in the morning,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.620]   I do go get my sunlight.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.620]   If the sun isn't out,
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.620]   I turn on as many bright artificial lights
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.260]   as I can manage or tolerate,
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.340]   and then I go get my sunlight exposure.
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.460]   But once I set out to do some work
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.880]   that all the overhead lights in that room are on,
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.100]   as well as lights in front of me.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.180]   And that's, again, to stimulate heightened levels of focus
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.260]   and further release of these neuromodulators
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.100]   that I mentioned before,
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.920]   dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.260]   Now, the way that one could do that
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.380]   could be a very low cost way of having, for instance,
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.520]   a desk lamp and those overhead lights.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.500]   If you're somebody that wants to take this
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.500]   to the next level, you can purchase a ring light,
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.180]   which is, I think those are mainly made
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.920]   for people doing selfie-type videos,
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.780]   for Instagram posts and things of that sort.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.820]   Ring lights can be pretty cost-effective,
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.940]   and yet they're very bright,
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.840]   and they have the sort of bright blue light
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.960]   that is going to optimally stimulate
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.900]   those melanopsin ganglion cells.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.160]   So some people I know will have a blue light
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.700]   or a bright LED on their desk in front of them.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.780]   And indeed, I have one of these.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.480]   I don't use a ring light, I use a light pad.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.420]   The particular light pad I use, I bought on Amazon.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.260]   I can mention the brand,
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.300]   but again, I have no financial affiliation to them.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.340]   This is the Artograph light pad.
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.060]   It's designed for drawing, and it says on it, "930 lux."
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.160]   Lux is just a measure of brightness.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.060]   So I place that on the desk in front of me,
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.620]   and I turn it on essentially
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.380]   throughout this phase one of the day.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.440]   Even if I walk away from the desk, I tend to keep it on.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.940]   It doesn't consume that much energy.
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.040]   And in that way, I'm constantly being bombarded with photons
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.020]   that keep my levels of alertness up,
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.260]   because the early part of the day
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.700]   is when I do the majority of that focused work.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.200]   Again, you don't need the light pad.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.100]   You can use a ring light,
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.340]   or you can simply use any kind of other lights
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.520]   that you might happen to have, artificial lights.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.120]   For those of you that can place your desk near a window,
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.840]   and even better to open the window,
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.340]   that would be really fantastic.
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.300]   I don't have access to that.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.860]   Why would I say open the window?
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.160]   Well, it turns out that sunlight
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.900]   is going to be the best stimulus
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.020]   for waking up your brain and body
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.600]   through this melanopsin to hypothalamus system.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.100]   And by looking at sunlight through a window,
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.280]   it's 50, five, zero times less effective
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.980]   than if that window were to be open,
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.860]   mostly because those windows filter out
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.560]   a lot of the wavelengths of blue light
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.980]   that are essential for stimulating the eyes
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.700]   and this wake-up signal.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.460]   So all of this rests on the premise
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.160]   that we need to be alert in order to do our work,
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.360]   in particular, focused work.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.300]   And I've talked about before in the habits episode,
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.880]   and I'm saying again now, that first phase of the day,
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.600]   that first seven or eight or nine hours of the day
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.580]   is really the time in which our neurochemistry is primed
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.560]   for getting the most amount of focused,
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.100]   kind of challenging work done
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.340]   where a lot of precision and detail is required.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.820]   So you want to brightly light your work environment
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.500]   during that first phase.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.400]   Again, from the time you wake up, try and get sunlight,
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.900]   but then even if you're going to get exercise
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.740]   or do other things,
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.100]   you want to get as much bright light in your eyes
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.260]   as you safely can,
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.920]   and then you want to light your work environment.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.580]   Now in the afternoon, starting at about nine
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.240]   and continuing until about 16 hours after waking,
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.240]   you want to start dimming the lights in that environment.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.780]   Now you don't want to make it dark
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.900]   because you don't want to get sleepy
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.140]   at two o'clock in the afternoon
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.460]   unless you're going to take a brief nap,
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.960]   which I do and is perfectly fine
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.660]   as long as it doesn't interfere with your nighttime sleep.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.860]   But the idea is that in this so-called phase two
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.520]   of the 24 hour cycle,
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.960]   from about nine to 16 hours after waking,
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.860]   you want to bring the level of lights down a bit.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.900]   And when I say down, I literally mean down.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.660]   Having lights that are in front of you is fine,
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.840]   but overhead lights at that time are not going to be optimal
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.720]   for the sorts of neurochemical states
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.120]   that your brain wants to be in.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.080]   The states that I'm referring to
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.480]   are a shift from the dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.220]   that's highest early in the day,
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.600]   to increases in things like serotonin
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.120]   and other neuromodulators that put your brain
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.000]   into a state that's better for creative endeavors
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.900]   or for more abstract thinking.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.740]   Now, as we'll soon see,
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.040]   there are other things you can do
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.640]   to improve creative thinking and abstract thinking.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.660]   And in fact, there are things you can do
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.940]   to improve analytic thinking.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.080]   We will talk about those.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.460]   Things that are distinct from light,
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.260]   but right now we're just focusing on light.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.980]   So what I recommend doing and what I personally do
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.780]   is I will turn off overhead lights in the afternoon.
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.200]   It's not completely dim, it's not completely dark,
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.040]   but I will start to reduce the amount of overhead light
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.780]   and just simply keep the light pad on
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.420]   and whatever other lamps I happen to be using.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.340]   Now, one thing we haven't talked about is screen brightness.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.940]   This is highly individual.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.280]   People have different retinal sensitivities.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.660]   What I mean by that is everybody differs
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.200]   in terms of how bright they can tolerate
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.480]   their visual environment and their screen.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.160]   And whether or not you are sensitive to light or not
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.420]   will depend on a lot of factors.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.500]   Some of it is eye color.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.540]   Indeed, people with darker color eyes
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.940]   generally can tolerate more bright light than others.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.260]   I have green eyes.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.500]   I am very, very sensitive to light.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.340]   If I'm outdoors at a cafe or something
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.400]   and the table has any kind of reflective properties
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.780]   and it's a sunny day,
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.380]   I can barely see the person across the table for me
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.300]   unless I'm wearing sunglasses.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.080]   Some people, other members of my family, for instance,
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.100]   have dark brown eyes and can just sit there
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.260]   and have a conversation
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.600]   without the need for sunglasses at all.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.320]   So there's tremendous variation there.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.420]   One or the other isn't healthy or advantageous necessarily.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.740]   Just understand that you never want to be in an environment
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.320]   where it's painful to maintain
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.920]   looking at whatever it is that you're looking at.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.160]   If something's painful to look at,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.420]   it could be damaging to your eyes.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.420]   So you do want to protect your eyes.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.300]   Now, in this second phase of the day,
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.900]   since most of us are working indoors,
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.740]   but even if you're working outdoors,
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.580]   you want to try and get the amount of light reduced overall,
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.340]   but in particular that overhead light.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.260]   And you also want to start reducing the amount of blue light
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.620]   that you're being exposed to.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.660]   So somewhere around four or 5 p.m.,
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.620]   which for me is about 12 hours after I've been awake
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.500]   or 14 hours after I've been awake,
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.420]   I will turn off that light pad
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.020]   and start to transition the lights in my environment
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.060]   to more yellows and reds.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.220]   Now, I can't always do this.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.060]   I have friends that actually have converted
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.980]   their entire homes from blue light early in the day
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.180]   to red light late in the day.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.740]   That's really cool and fantastic.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.140]   I haven't done that.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.780]   There's a cost to doing that.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.140]   And it is optimal in terms of optimizing productivity
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.060]   and sleep and so forth,
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.380]   but it's not feasible for a lot of people.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.060]   But what I do is I simply switch to using yellow lamps.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.680]   I will turn off that LED in the later afternoon again
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.180]   around four or 5 p.m.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.880]   And I tend to wake up around 6 a.m. or so.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.900]   I'll turn those off.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.180]   And what I'll try and do also
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.600]   is I'll try and dim the screen that I'm working on
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.300]   so that I can still manage to see everything
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.380]   that I need to see,
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.460]   but it's quite a bit dimmer than it was early in the day.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.980]   So that's phase two of the day,
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.020]   and that's how we want to think about light.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.500]   And then I'll just mention,
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.980]   because I know there are people
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.660]   who are working in the middle of the night,
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.500]   there's phase three,
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.820]   which is about 17 to 24 hours after waking.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.540]   And I realized that for shift workers
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.620]   or for people that are pulling all-nighters
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.100]   or for students, oftentimes you need to be awake
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.100]   and studying in the middle of the night.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.580]   I myself am somebody who for years
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.980]   would pull anywhere from five to 10 all-nighters per year.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.820]   I still pull an all-nighter now and again
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.340]   because of deadlines and so forth.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.220]   I don't recommend it.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.280]   If you can avoid it, great,
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.820]   but many people just simply have to do this
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.100]   for sake of shift work
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.620]   or because of impending deadlines or procrastination
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.140]   or all of the above.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.220]   If you are going to be doing work
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.020]   in that third phase of your circadian cycle,
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.900]   you really want to limit the amount of bright light
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.480]   that you're getting in your eyes
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.080]   to just the amount that allows you to do the work
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.920]   that you're doing.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.600]   Because if you get light in your eyes
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.260]   that's any brighter than that,
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.980]   you're going to severely deplete your melatonin levels.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.580]   You're going to severely shift your circadian clock
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.380]   and it's effectively like traveling to another time zone.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.540]   So if you stay up from 3 a.m. until 6 a.m.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.720]   or 2 a.m. until 4 a.m. working on a term paper
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.660]   or something of that sort,
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.580]   and you're getting bright light in your eyes,
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.440]   you are effectively flying six hours
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.580]   to a different time zone
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.540]   or at least that's what your body registers it as.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.680]   And it can really throw your sleep and your metabolism
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.120]   and a number of other things out of whack.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.220]   Now there's an exception to this,
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.120]   which is if you really want to be awake,
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.500]   it can often be beneficial
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.080]   to flipping on all the lights in the room
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.480]   and keeping them really bright.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.640]   One of the hardest things to do
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.600]   is to stay up all night studying
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.640]   when you're in a dim environment.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.580]   So you have to determine the trade-off
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.020]   between whether or not you want to shift your clock
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.840]   or whether or not you want to get the work done.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.280]   And I would say the ideal situation is to sleep at night
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.880]   and to do your work during the day and in the afternoon.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.560]   But if you do have to be awake in the middle of the night,
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.740]   do understand that you want to dim those lights overall.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.480]   You would not want to use that LED.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.160]   You would not want to have overhead lights on
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.320]   unless you're really struggling to stay awake,
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.220]   in which case you want to get
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.960]   as many bright lights on as possible.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.680]   So there are a couple of tricks to all-nighters.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.320]   I don't really want people pulling all-nighters
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.520]   unless they have to,
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.600]   but there are a few things that you can do
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.440]   without taking stimulants in order to stay up all night
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.560]   that can be beneficial that maximize on your biology.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.800]   One of them that's a little less commonly known
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.480]   is you can drink 32 ounces of water
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.600]   and commit to not going to the bathroom
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.440]   for 90 minutes at least.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.840]   It turns out that there's a circuit
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.260]   that goes from your bladder,
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.000]   literally neurons that go from your bladder
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.240]   to your brainstem.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.680]   And when you have to urinate, it makes you very alert,
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.120]   as many of you have probably experienced.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.140]   This is actually what wakes us up
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.180]   in the middle of the night
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.400]   when we have to use the bathroom,
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.040]   is this circuit for alertness that goes from full bladder.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.760]   It's signaled by the bladder being full to the brainstem.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.800]   And this is the circuit that is disrupted
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.680]   in kids that have bedwetting issues.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.560]   And there are a number of cognitive behavioral approaches
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.160]   to that, sometimes bedwetting in very young kids
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.280]   is because the circuit hasn't developed yet.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.080]   Most adults fortunately are not bedwetting,
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.920]   but you can increase the amount of alertness in your system
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.360]   and remain awake in the middle of the night
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.040]   by drinking a little bit more water than you normally would,
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.780]   and then refraining from going to the restroom.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.480]   That certainly will lend itself to alertness.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.580]   You know how difficult it is to fall asleep
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.760]   when you have to use the restroom, for instance.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.640]   So that's one tool.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.040]   The other thing is, again, to flip on
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.640]   as many bright lights in the environment as possible.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.160]   And then of course, people will rely on stimulants
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.680]   like caffeine or even more aggressive stimulants.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.080]   That's not something I necessarily recommend.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.820]   You'll each have to determine that for you.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.320]   But if you do in fact have to use all nighters
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.240]   for any reason, you can maximize
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.380]   this bladder to brain approach and the bright light approach.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.920]   Okay, so that more or less covers
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.360]   how bright to keep your overall environment
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.740]   and how bright to keep your screen.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.500]   If you really want to get nerdy about this,
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.580]   there is a free app called Light Meter,
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.120]   where you can start measuring how many lux,
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.600]   how many photons are in a given environment.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.380]   It's actually measuring reflectance of photons and so on.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.720]   If you can look up what a lux meter does, if you like.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.320]   I don't necessarily recommend doing that.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.800]   I don't want to set a critical threshold by which,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.540]   for instance, we say once your environment
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.940]   is more than 1500 lux, then it's too bright
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.660]   or not bright enough, et cetera.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.560]   Everyone has different retinal sensitivities.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.680]   Everyone will find that different levels of brightness
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.220]   will cause them to be alert.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.520]   Different levels of dimness, if you will, in the room
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.160]   will cause them to feel sleepy.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.980]   You really want to just modulate across the 24 hour cycle
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.560]   where it's very bright.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.360]   As bright as it safely can be early in the day
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.960]   so that you are alert, you can do your focus detailed work
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.040]   in that first phase.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.800]   And then in the afternoon, as you move into
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.080]   more creative type works or abstract thinking
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.340]   or working with other people in kind of a brainstorming mode
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.840]   that you would shift to dimmer lights, yellow lights,
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.040]   eliminate the blue lights as much as possible.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.740]   Now that's light, but there's another aspect of vision
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.960]   that has been shown to be critically important
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.400]   for how alert we are going to be
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.360]   and how well we can maintain that alertness.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.760]   And that has to do with where our visual focus is
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.160]   in a given environment.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.660]   So I'm not talking about overall brightness.
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.440]   What I'm referring to now is simply where you place
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.460]   your phone or your tablet or computer screen or book,
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.520]   whatever it is that you happen to be looking at.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.100]   There's a very underappreciated and yet incredible aspect
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.580]   of our neurology that has to do with the relationship
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.180]   between where we look and our level of alertness.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.840]   And it works in a very logical way.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.980]   We have clusters of neurons in our brainstem
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.940]   and those clusters of neurons control our eyelid muscles
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.420]   and they control our eye movements up and down
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.260]   into the sides.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.380]   And indeed, if you were to look at an eyeball,
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.440]   I've looked at a lot of eyeballs in my lab
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.460]   and I teach neuroanatomy, so we do this from time to time,
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.620]   we would see that there are six muscles attached
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.960]   to your eyeball.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.800]   Now, four of them are located at the top, the bottom
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.380]   and the two sides of your eyeball.
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.700]   So we're at the 12 o'clock, six o'clock, three o'clock
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.580]   and nine o'clock of your eyeball.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.460]   And those muscles can move your eye in the socket
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.140]   from side to side and up and down.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.540]   And then we also have some muscles that can actually
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.580]   pull the eyeballs at angles, okay?
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.620]   So we have different muscles that can move the eyes
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.740]   at different angles as well.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.140]   And that's why we can look up into the side
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.940]   or down into the side, not just from side to side
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.180]   or up or down.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.520]   Now, the neurons that control those muscles
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.660]   have a very interesting feature,
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.500]   which is that when we are looking down toward the ground
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.300]   or anywhere below basically the central region of our face,
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.140]   the neurons that control that eye movement
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.740]   are intimately related to areas of the brainstem
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.980]   that release certain types of neuromodulators
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.340]   and neurotransmitters.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.600]   And they activate areas of the brain that are associated
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.780]   with calm and indeed even with sleepiness.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.780]   And there's an active inhibition or prevention of neurons
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.660]   that increase alertness.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.360]   Now, the opposite is also true.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.920]   We have neurons that place our eyes into an upward gaze
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.940]   above the sort of level of our nose and up above our forehead
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.360]   literally looking up while keeping the head stationary.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.140]   Or if you tilt your head back and you look up,
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.980]   these neurons are still active.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.840]   Those neurons don't just control the position of the eyes
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.400]   and cause them to move up.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.160]   They also trigger the activation of brain circuits
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.560]   that are associated with alertness.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.160]   Now, this is a fundamental feature
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.480]   of the way that our eyes and brain are wired together
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.280]   and how they relate to what we call autonomic arousal.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.360]   And there are a bunch of details there.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.640]   We will actually have a guest in a few weeks
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.440]   who has learned to exploit these neurons
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.480]   and the fact that they control these different states
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.640]   of calm or alertness in order to generate hypnotic states,
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.900]   to place people into very atypical states
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.900]   in which they are both very alert and very calm.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.620]   Save that for a future episode.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.820]   But the important thing to understand
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:23.140]   is when you are looking down below the level of your nose,
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.100]   you are essentially decelerating your alertness.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.960]   You're reducing your amount of alertness.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.180]   It might be subtle, but it's happening.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.660]   Whereas when you look straight ahead
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.860]   or in particular when you look up,
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.180]   you're increasing your level of alertness.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.240]   Now, this has some obvious implications.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.420]   When we get sleepy, our eyelids tend to close
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.020]   and we tend to nod down.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.860]   When we're wide awake, we tend to be wide-eyed.
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.500]   We don't tend to blink as often.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.300]   And we tend to be chin up
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.300]   and kind of on vigilance and alertness.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.380]   So this has a evolutionary
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.940]   or at least an adaptive component to it.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.300]   This can be exploited and indeed it's been researched
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.100]   in terms of how it can be used
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.980]   to optimize work environments.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.360]   Contrary to what most people do,
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.180]   which is to look down at their laptop, tablet, or phone,
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.420]   if you want to be alert
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.180]   and you want to maintain the maximum amount of focus
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.460]   for whatever it is that you're reading or doing,
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.020]   you want that screen or whatever it is
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.260]   that you're looking at to at least be at eye level
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.900]   and ideally slightly above it.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.660]   Now, I haven't seen many workspaces
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.300]   that take advantage of this very hardwired
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.680]   neurobiological fact.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.240]   So what should you do with this information?
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.520]   Well, if you're somebody who sits down to do work
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.660]   and start to feel sleepy or simply unfocused,
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.960]   unable to attend to whatever it is that you're doing,
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.340]   I highly recommend that you take your laptop or tablet.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.620]   I do hope that most people
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.500]   aren't doing serious work on their phones
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.120]   because it's such a small visual window
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.260]   and we can talk about why that's an issue later.
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.820]   And the idea would be to place that screen of your tablet
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.760]   or your laptop or other computer
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.820]   and try and get it elevated at least to nose level,
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.020]   your nose level, or even higher.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.060]   And I realize that can be complicated to do.
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.820]   I've long just used a stack of books
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.140]   or I'll sometimes take a box
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.840]   and turn it upside down and set it there.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   I do use a mixed standing seated desk.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.980]   I'll talk about that in a few minutes.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.300]   There are a number of different ways that you could do this.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.820]   You could wall mount a monitor.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.560]   I think many people are working with laptops.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.420]   It's a little bit harder to do that with a laptop.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.740]   Some people though will configure a second screen.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.200]   You have to decide what's right for you and your budget.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.000]   But again, in addition to having a brightly lit room
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.040]   to be able to focus and attend
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.400]   to whatever it is you're working on,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.600]   you want to have that screen position high
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.640]   in your visual environment.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.780]   Now you wouldn't want it on the ceiling necessarily.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.280]   Oh, that would be pretty cool.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.240]   But you do want it above you.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.160]   Now there are a couple of solutions to this
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.160]   that don't involve a wall mount
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.980]   or stacking books or boxes.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.080]   For instance, you could be one of those people
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.120]   that likes to lie in bed or on the sofa
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.840]   and get your screen up above you
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.580]   by putting pillows on your knees.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.420]   I used to actually do a lot of my writing and work
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.260]   in the middle of the night.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.940]   I don't do this anymore and I don't recommend it,
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.600]   but I used to do a lot of work from bed.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.760]   Now I no longer bring electronics for work into the bedroom.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.440]   I just really try and keep the bedroom for sleeping
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.500]   or whatever else.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.340]   But in terms of lying down on the couch,
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.140]   it is somewhat easier to get that screen up above you.
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.900]   You can kind of slide underneath that screen and get typing.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.180]   But there's a problem with that.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.440]   And we'll talk about this a little bit more in a moment,
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.740]   but it turns out that your posture,
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.760]   literally the position of your body relative to gravity
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.640]   also has important implications for how alert you are.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.660]   So ideally you would be standing or seated.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.420]   I would say the ideal would be standing,
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.200]   second best would be seated.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.800]   And your screen will be either directly in front of you
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.080]   or slightly above you.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.660]   Or if you wanted to get really fancy,
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.160]   you could create a situation where it was above you
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.720]   and slightly tilted toward you
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.340]   so that you actually had to maintain
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.920]   kind of proper neck posture.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.380]   This accomplishes a number of things.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.960]   In addition to making you more alert,
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.300]   you also get away from the so-called text neck.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.880]   People are starting to look more like Cs nowadays,
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.840]   the shape of the letter C,
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.780]   because we're constantly looking down.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.640]   I do every once in a while see somebody who's texting
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.240]   in public with it at eye level.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.040]   It always looks a little odd that they're doing that,
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.140]   but I always admire their posture at the same time.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.220]   So we shouldn't give them a hard time.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.980]   So this is another feature that you can arrange
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.740]   into your physical workspace.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.880]   Again, whether or not you're seated
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.320]   or you're standing throughout the day,
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.320]   try and get that screen elevated.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.240]   Now, with reference to posture,
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.420]   there are beautiful data illustrating that
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.560]   when we are standing up,
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.920]   those same neurons in our brainstem, locus coeruleus neurons,
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.520]   which release, I should mention,
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.760]   things like norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.520]   those neurons become active when we are standing.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.320]   They become even more active when we are ambulatory,
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.160]   when we are moving.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.520]   And we will talk about treadmilling and cycling at your desk
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.200]   and so forth in a little bit.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   But when you sit, they become a little less active.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.220]   And when you lie down and indeed,
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.040]   anytime that you start to get your feet up above your waist
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.200]   or your head tilted back,
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.880]   those neurons fire less and neurons in your brain
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.680]   that are involved in calming and indeed putting you to sleep
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.980]   start increasing their level of firing.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.600]   It's a really beautiful system.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.760]   So beautiful, in fact, that there are studies that show
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.540]   that as you adjust the angle of the body back,
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.500]   you actually get a sort of dose dependent increase
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.420]   in sleepiness and calmness
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.860]   and a dose dependent decrease in alertness.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.100]   And so as we were all told to sit up straight
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.080]   or even better to stand up straight.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.080]   And now I'm also telling you to get that visual thing
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.760]   that you're attending to screen or otherwise
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   up in front of you or ideally above you.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.640]   Those things combine to generate maximum alertness.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.080]   So you can think about how you might work this
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.280]   into various aspects of your homework environment
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.980]   or office work environment.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.360]   But as I described this,
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.040]   many of you are probably thinking what I'm thinking,
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.960]   which is gosh, most of what we do
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.300]   is in complete opposite direction
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.280]   to all of this neurobiologically grounded advice.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.160]   Most of us are looking down at our laptop while seated
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.080]   or we are lying down, which is going to make us more sleepy,
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.200]   or we are positioning our computers in front of us,
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.040]   but we really aren't in an environment that's bright enough
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.380]   and so on and so forth.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.380]   So as you can tell, we're starting to layer in
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.860]   the various things that you can do.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.960]   First, brightness in the room.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.580]   Second, get that screen up
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.980]   and try and put yourself into a posture for work
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.740]   that lends itself or promotes alertness.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.280]   If indeed you want to be alert for that work.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.620]   If your goal is to take a nap,
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.780]   get your feet elevated about 10 to 15 degrees
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.620]   above your head,
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.660]   maybe put a pillow underneath it, lie down and take a nap.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.880]   But that's not what we're talking about today.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.840]   We're talking about workspace optimization.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.600]   And I suppose you could also exploit that all-nighter trick
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.980]   that I talked about earlier.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.240]   I actually did this when I was an undergraduate.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.440]   I was a little bit masochistic in this way.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.980]   I would drink coffee and water at fairly high volume.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.980]   I wasn't, you know, forced drinking or anything like that,
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.060]   but I actually wouldn't allow myself to get up
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.800]   and use the bathroom except on a timer.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.360]   So I think the longest I ever went was three and a half
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.460]   hours. It was kind of excruciating.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.140]   I actually don't think that's necessarily a healthy advice,
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.520]   but again, you can use slight,
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.900]   I mentioned slight over consumption of fluids
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.560]   in order to generate alertness.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.580]   That was just me really trying to get as much work done
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.420]   as I could.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.040]   It was a very demanding class schedule.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.260]   And it was just the only way that I could get work done.
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.080]   If I was getting up every few minutes to use the restroom,
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.760]   I found it hard to re-engage in that work and maintain
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.380]   focus, which is what I just want to briefly mention now,
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.960]   I talked about this in the episode on focus,
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.320]   but one thing that is completely unreasonable and that you
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:31.380]   should never ask yourself to do is to sit down or stand up
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.140]   and immediately focus on something,
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.720]   unless you're stressed about what you're looking at,
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.280]   or you're very, very excited by it.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.780]   If you're very stressed about some sort of information or a
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.480]   deadline, or you're very, very excited about something,
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.040]   you'll find that you can focus instantly just within a
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:45.880]   moment.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.840]   And that's because of the deployment of neurochemicals like
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.960]   dopamine and norepinephrine that bring about our levels of
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.040]   alertness. However, most of us,
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.500]   including myself will go to begin a workout and we'll find
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.640]   that our mind doesn't quite engage at the level of depth and
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.000]   focus that we would like right off the bat.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.360]   I've timed this and other studies have timed this in a more
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.780]   rigorous way. Mine is just what we call anec data,
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.040]   but so I've timed it for myself,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.340]   but there are studies that have looked at this and the data
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.160]   point to the fact that even at our most heightened levels of
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.200]   focus,
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.220]   most people can only maintain focus before switching tasks
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.900]   for about three minutes,
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.500]   which is depressingly short period of time. However,
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.940]   you can extend that period of time.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.100]   And I've talked about that in the episode on focus,
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:27.940]   but more importantly,
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.900]   when you sit down to start a workout of any kind,
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:35.180]   any kind expect that it would take about six minutes for
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.440]   you to engage these neural circuits.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.380]   You wouldn't expect yourself to walk into the gym and do a PR
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.900]   lift or start running and do your best sprint,
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.700]   or just head out the door without warming up at all.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.500]   You know, a little walk, jog at first, or, you know,
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.200]   a few warmups sets. I mean, that's, we expect that.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.460]   We are not surprised that we need that.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.360]   And yet we sort of expect that our brain should be able to
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.200]   lock on and do work in a very focused way immediately.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.520]   And that's just a ridiculous assumption.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.620]   It's an unfair assumption, I should say.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.660]   So assume that it will take about six minutes to engage in
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.420]   your workout and that those neurochemical systems will take
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.720]   some time to rev up and engage.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.600]   The other things that I'm describing about lighting and
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.800]   screen positioning and posture,
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.080]   those will also help maximize your focus and will limit that
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.000]   ramp up time into a focus state.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.700]   And I think what you'll find is that as you maximize your
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.360]   workspace, the time, the latency, as we say,
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.520]   to get into that focus will start to shorten.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.340]   It'll especially start to shorten if you use tools to limit
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.580]   distraction, we will talk about distraction,
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.040]   but things like freedom, which is an app,
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.320]   a free app that allows you to lock yourself out of the
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.000]   internet or turning off your phone, for instance,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.440]   but even if you're doing work on your phone or that involves
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.320]   your phone or the internet, as many of us,
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.640]   including myself do expect there to be a ramp up time for
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.720]   you to focus.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.100]   There's another aspect of our vision.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.800]   That's absolutely critical for optimizing our workspace.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.760]   And that has to do with this really interesting feature of
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.520]   our visual pathways in that it has two major channels.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.040]   Those two major channels have names,
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.400]   although you don't have to remember the names.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.600]   The first one is the so-called parvo cellular channel,
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.840]   which is involved in looking at things at specific points in
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.080]   space and at high resolution or detail.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.140]   And then there's the so-called magna cellular channel that's
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:21.400]   involved in looking at big swaths of visual space and at
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.360]   lower resolution.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.200]   So you can think of the parvo cellular system as kind of a
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.840]   high pixel density.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.080]   Think about your most modern smartphone,
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.480]   the recent smartphone with the best, best camera,
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.640]   and think about the magna cellular system as being lower
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.240]   resolution, kind of an older smartphone, lower pixels,
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.080]   et cetera.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:38.920]   You might ask,
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.040]   why would you want a system that's low resolution?
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.160]   Well, the low resolution system is better at things like
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.600]   detecting motion and not so much at detail and vice versa.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.080]   Now, again, you don't have to remember the names.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.400]   What you do have to remember however,
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.200]   is that you're going to create the maximum amount of
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.260]   alertness in your system.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.420]   The maximum amount of ability to focus when your system is in
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.120]   that parvo cellular mode,
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.960]   when you're bringing your eyes to a common point,
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.840]   what we call a vergence eye movement, V E R G E N C E.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.560]   I've said this before on the podcast and people said,
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.560]   virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye movement,
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.800]   as in convergence,
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.520]   bringing your eyes to a single point in space will create a
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.200]   narrower aperture of a visual window, meaning your,
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.360]   your visual world actually shrinks, at least perceptually.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.940]   Whereas when you relax your eyes and dilate your gaze,
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.320]   you can do this now by whatever environment you're in,
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.140]   trying to see without moving your head off to the side,
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.820]   above, below you, as broadly as possible.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.760]   Maybe you can dilate your gaze so much that you can see
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.280]   yourself, your body in that visual environment.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.000]   And you'll notice that your resolution of vision isn't
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   nearly as high as when you do that vergence eye movement,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.080]   vergence eye movements are incredibly powerful for creating
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.960]   heightened states of alertness and focus.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.260]   And indeed they create heightened states of cognition of
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.100]   thinking.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.600]   And that's because your brain follows your vision in terms
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.760]   of focus.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.560]   When we say I can't focus what we often are experiencing is
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:05.560]   an ability and inability, excuse me, to not focus visually.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.680]   Whereas when we are in a very focused state,
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.640]   we are in a state often where we can focus visually.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.840]   Now we can also do this with our auditory system or to
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.680]   touch, et cetera.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.720]   But right now we're just talking about the visual system.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.380]   Now, in terms of workspace optimization,
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.960]   what this means is we never really want to be looking at a
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.400]   square or rectangle or target area for our work.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.720]   That is too far beyond our ears.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.060]   How far is too far?
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.600]   Really you want to try and keep the blinders on,
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.240]   or I should say the invisible blinders.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.080]   So that whatever you're looking at falls within the region of
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.560]   visual space in front of you,
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.000]   that is present if you were to cup your hands and put them
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.160]   right next to your eyes.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.600]   Now, this is a rough estimation, but I'm doing this now,
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.840]   for those of you that are watching on YouTube,
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.800]   I'm doing this now,
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.020]   I'm trying to simulate like a horse with blinders on.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:48.880]   For those of you that are listening,
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.520]   just imagine me looking silly with my hands cup near my
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.880]   eyes, but if we are to, for instance,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.880]   look at a screen that's very, very big,
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.960]   and we're too close to it,
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.440]   or even if we're standing back from it,
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.920]   it's going to be hard for us to attend to everything within
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.320]   that screen space.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.720]   So this is actually support for the idea of using a phone or
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.520]   a tablet or a laptop.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.880]   Some, my laptop is about 15 inches in diameter.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.400]   I think is the one that I have some are 13, some are 17.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.040]   Some of you like to use big monitors,
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.920]   make sure that whatever it is that you're looking at,
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.480]   if you want to remain focused,
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.360]   it doesn't extend too far beyond where your eyes are.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.320]   There's the size of your head that is.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.880]   So just think blinders on a horse.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.960]   And actually that's the reason they put blinders on a horse
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.960]   so that they're not looking off into the periphery.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.440]   Horses, unlike humans, don't have the same shaped pupil.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.360]   They don't have a visual system that's organized in quite
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.180]   the same way.
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:44.040]   They mostly see in panorama in Magnocellular vision.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.160]   And so those blinders are designed to keep their visual
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.200]   focus straight ahead.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.020]   So they physically restrict it.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:53.900]   Now, some people will actually go to lengths to further
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.700]   restrict their visual focus.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.040]   They will do things like putting on a hoodie or wearing a
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.940]   hat, for instance, to restrict their visual window.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.540]   And indeed that works quite well.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.280]   But as we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.580]   when you really restrict your visual window down to a very,
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:12.060]   very narrow portion of visual space,
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.940]   that actually changes the types of information that you are
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.460]   best at processing.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.300]   And we'll talk about that in terms of something that's
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.780]   called the cathedral effect in a few moments.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.320]   But for now, here's the principle.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.580]   Make sure that whatever you're looking at is directly in
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.580]   front of you and doesn't extend too far out to the side.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:32.940]   Once you get out to say six or 12 or certainly 18 inches on
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.120]   either side of your eyes, you are dilating your gaze.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.780]   By definition, you're dilating your gaze.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.380]   It's completely subconscious and it becomes very hard to
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.700]   maintain attention.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.120]   Now, the caveat to this is that if you are going to look at
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.020]   a narrow space, a narrow window for any period of time,
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.460]   whether or not it's a book or a laptop or a tablet or a
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.780]   phone,
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.940]   those virgins eye movements not only create alertness,
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.440]   but they also require energy and they also can fatigue the
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.900]   eyes because there's a process called accommodation whereby
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.820]   the shape of your eye literally has to change so that the
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.300]   lens can move so that you can focus at that location.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.100]   Accommodation is an incredible process,
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.380]   but it is a demanding one.
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.860]   And that's the reason that your eyes get tired when you
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.620]   focus on something for too long.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.460]   So here's a principle extracted from the ophthalmology and
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.940]   neuroscience literature that you can adopt for every 45
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.720]   minutes in which you are focusing on something like a phone
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.400]   or a tablet or a book page or your computer,
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:33.780]   you want to get into Magneseller panoramic vision for at
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.260]   least five minutes.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.640]   And the way that I suggest to do this is actually to take a
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.060]   walk. Ideally outside,
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.340]   we're going to talk about ambulation about movement and
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.760]   about how that can maintain alertness throughout the day.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.940]   So for every 45 minutes or so try and get five minutes of
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.260]   relaxing your eyes.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.980]   This is something that's not often done,
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.340]   especially in today's homeschooling and where people are
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.700]   where kids are going to school by zoom and adults are
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.060]   working by zoom. This is a serious problem.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.160]   People are getting eye fatigue, they're getting headaches.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.620]   Indeed. Some people are getting migraines.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.420]   They're having all sorts of issues, neck pain,
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.220]   much of that, if not all of that,
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.360]   in some cases can be alleviated by this 45 to five rule for
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.300]   every 45 minutes of focused work that you do get five
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.200]   minutes where you get outside.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.220]   Or if you have to be indoors where you can dilate your gaze.
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.900]   Now, some of you may be saying, well,
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.360]   that spits in the face of your 90 minute rule.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.200]   You're trying to,
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.100]   you've told us before that we should focus for 90 minutes.
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.440]   I would still want you to take breaks within those 90
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.280]   minutes.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.740]   If you're looking at a narrow piece of visual world,
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.380]   meaning at a phone or a laptop or so forth.
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.260]   And again, the best way to do this would be to go outside,
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.700]   just relax your eyes, look off into the distance,
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.280]   looking at a horizon will automatically trigger this
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.780]   panoramic gaze, which is very relaxing to the eyes,
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.900]   and will allow you to go back into a focused work bout.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:53.180]   The one thing you absolutely do not want to do is to go
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.940]   outside and check your phone,
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.720]   because if you're outside checking your phone or you're
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.800]   taking a break and checking your phone,
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.320]   you're still in that vergence eye movement. Okay?
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.560]   So this is very,
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.920]   very important because vergence eye movements increase focus
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.880]   and attention,
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.400]   and you can exploit that to increase focus and attention
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.300]   when you want to,
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:14.020]   but you absolutely need to relax the system again for every
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.520]   45 minutes in which you've been in that focused mode,
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:20.240]   you want to get at least five minutes of panoramic vision.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.980]   If you can take a 15 minute walk, even better.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.160]   Next I'd like to talk about an aspect of workspace
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.840]   optimization that can actually bias whether or not our brain
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.160]   and nervous system are better suited for detailed analytic
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.040]   work or more abstract work.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:36.880]   In fact,
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.560]   there's a way that you can arrange your work environment,
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.820]   or I should say there's a way that you can place yourself
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.760]   into certain environments that will allow abstract thinking,
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:51.100]   creative thinking, and indeed expansive thinking to emerge.
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.620]   There are other environments that you can put yourself in
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:56.960]   that will make your brain shift towards more analytic work
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.080]   toward more detailed and precise types of work.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.320]   Now, I just briefly want to mention something that was
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.360]   covered again on the habits episode that I did a few weeks
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.340]   ago, but again,
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.640]   you don't need to see that episode in order to digest this
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.800]   information.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.840]   It goes back to this issue of three phases within the
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.900]   circadian 24 hour cycle phase one,
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.600]   which as I mentioned is about zero to eight hours after
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.800]   waking phase two, nine to 16 hours after waking in phase
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.600]   three, 17 to 24 hours after waking phase one,
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:30.600]   being ideal for analytic precise detailed types of work
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.760]   phase two,
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.320]   better suited for most people for creative kind of abstract
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.440]   thinking, expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.880]   There are some exceptions to that,
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.300]   but most people follow that pattern because of the different
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.380]   neuromodulators and hormones and so forth that are released
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.880]   into the brain and body at those different phases.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:54.560]   What I'm about to tell you is a way in which you can use
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.320]   your physical environment to further shift your brain and
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.800]   nervous system into a mode that's either prime for analytic
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.020]   or abstract and creative thinking.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.020]   What I'm about to describe is called the cathedral effect.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:10.800]   The cathedral effect has been discussed well, really,
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.320]   for many, many decades, maybe even hundreds of years,
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.740]   but formally has been discussed since the early 2000s in
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.440]   which it seemed that people who were in high ceilinged
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.680]   environments, hence the phrase cathedral,
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.320]   would shift their thinking and their ideas to more abstract
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.360]   and creative lofty type thinking.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.860]   So literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking,
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   higher aspirations that this was observed in terms of the
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.900]   language that they use,
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.600]   but also the sorts of ideas that they would generate.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:45.380]   And conversely that people that were in lower ceilinged
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:50.380]   environments would be more oriented toward using language
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:53.760]   that was more restricted, literally more detailed,
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.600]   analytic about things in their immediate space.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.160]   Now, this seems kind of wild on the one hand,
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.020]   but actually if we go back to our understanding of the
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.680]   neurobiology of the visual system and the way that our
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.360]   brains and bodies evolved in different environments,
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.000]   it actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.780]   We don't have time to go into a long lecture about
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.320]   evolutionary neurobiology,
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.940]   but we have to remember that our nervous system has a number
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.040]   of features that are adapted to different environments.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.940]   And indeed we are able to go from big open prairies or
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:26.520]   mountain tops or large cathedrals or concert halls into small
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.360]   environments and everything scales with it, right?
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.320]   When we're outdoors in a big expansive space,
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.760]   our vision tends to go long.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.520]   We tend to be in panoramic, magnocellular vision.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.280]   Our hearing tends to extend long.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.200]   Even if we're having a conversation with somebody,
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.400]   we tend to also be attending somewhat to the, you know,
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.960]   the screech of hawks off in the distance or to the rush of a
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.440]   river. Whereas when we were in small spaces, everything,
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.880]   our vision, our hearing, and indeed,
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.920]   even our physical movements become more restrained.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.160]   Even if we can still extend our hands out as far as we want.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.120]   What do I mean by that?
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.080]   Let's say you're in an elevator.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.440]   That's a small space compared to outside on a field.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.040]   This has been measured over and over again.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.920]   People's the size or the amplitude of people's spontaneous
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.680]   movements actually scales down in smaller environments,
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.600]   even if they aren't completely restricted from extending
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.960]   their limbs all the way. Whereas when we were outdoors,
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.840]   we feel a natural impulse to move further away from our,
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.400]   our body, our torso with our limbs.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.220]   This is just feels like more appropriate behavior.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.120]   And when I say appropriate,
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.740]   I don't mean in any kind of social context necessarily.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.080]   There's actually a reason for this,
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.560]   the visual system and the so-called vestibular motor system
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.200]   are intimately linked.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.960]   And I can just tell you briefly one way in which you can test
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.600]   this and observe this and even use this.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.400]   It's a little off topic from today's episode,
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.400]   but let's say you have a certain amount of flexibility.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.520]   You can extend your arms off like wings is what I'm doing
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.920]   for those either listening, not watching,
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.560]   off to your sides with arms straight.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.200]   And you have, you reach a maximum positioning of
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.140]   flexibility.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:03.160]   You can do a quick experiment where you sit still,
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.720]   you would bring your arms in for a moment.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.040]   You can put them on your knees if you like,
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.240]   or in front of you.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:11.200]   And you can move your eyes very far off into the periphery
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.040]   of your visual field.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.480]   So you actually, I'm going to do this now.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.320]   It looks kind of silly,
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.000]   but moving my eyes without moving my head off into the
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.320]   periphery, all the way to the right,
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.440]   then all the way to the left, all the way up,
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.480]   all the way down, but especially all the way to the left,
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:27.360]   almost looking over my shoulder without turning my head all
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.600]   the way to my right.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.320]   And you will find that you actually can extend your arms
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.080]   further back subsequent to that.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.360]   And that's not magic,
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.160]   but it has to do with the ways in which your cerebellum,
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.680]   which actually means mini brain and your eyes,
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.000]   your visual system are connected and the way in which your
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.740]   cerebellum controls some of the spindles and other aspects
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.680]   of the neuromuscular architecture of your nervous system,
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.040]   'cause your nerves control your muscles and allow those
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.540]   muscles to move further out.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.280]   So for those of you that lack flexibility,
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.480]   you can actually exploit your visual system for this.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.280]   Now that's again, a bit of a tangent,
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.560]   but it's a fun one that relates back to this so-called
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.200]   cathedral effect.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.340]   The cathedral effect is a way in which our thinking becomes
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.460]   more restricted and restrained in tighter, smaller,
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.640]   more confined visual environments.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.420]   Or if the ceiling is higher,
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:19.040]   we are in expansive space with a lot of distance above us or
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.900]   space above us and out to the sides,
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:21.880]   maybe even out on a field,
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.960]   our thinking goes into these more broad,
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:29.920]   abstract and loftier future thinking in particular.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.480]   This has actually been measured.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.600]   There's a really nice paper.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.840]   I will post a link to this.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.280]   The authors are Joan Myers Levy and Rui,
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.040]   and then in parentheses, Juliet Zoo.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.080]   I'm going to assume that they go by Juliet.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.480]   The title of the paper is the influence of ceiling height,
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.800]   the effect of priming on the type of processing that people
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.640]   use.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.220]   And I won't go into all the details of this paper,
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:51.640]   but what's really cool about this paper is they looked with
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.460]   very rigorous statistics and they have a fair number of
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:55.300]   subjects.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.640]   And everything about this paper looks solid to me at the
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:02.600]   difference in cognitive processing and abstract thinking and
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.680]   detailed analytic work that people are able to perform in
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.780]   environments that have a 10 foot ceiling versus an eight
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.400]   foot ceiling, which is not that much of a difference.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.960]   It's just two, two foot difference there.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:18.220]   And what they found were significant effects whereby high
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:22.160]   ceilings activate concepts related to abstraction.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.560]   Whereas low ceilings prime confinement related concepts,
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.740]   but are promote the kind of detailed thinking that,
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.720]   that lends itself well to sort of spreadsheet type work or
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.180]   accounting type work.
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:36.020]   Whereas abstract creative work was supported by these higher
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.380]   ceilings and the way they analyze this was really
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.220]   interesting.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:40.760]   Again, we don't have time to go into all the details,
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.640]   but they ask people to sort of generate word sets related to
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.920]   particular topics like sports.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:48.760]   And, you know,
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.020]   so people will talk about soccer, football, baseball, golf,
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.680]   et cetera, and talk about some of the equipment and other
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.520]   things.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.680]   And then they had a kind of a challenge,
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.960]   a cognitive challenge whereby people had to link different
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:02.120]   concepts along different dimensions so that you depart from
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.800]   the dimension of sport and you start thinking about sports
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.640]   that involve teams or sports that involve a ball, et cetera.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.300]   And so in the same conditions you can accept for the fact
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.040]   that the ceiling height is different eight feet or 10 feet.
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.980]   What one finds is that the kinds of language and the kinds
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:19.600]   of associations that people start to create are vastly
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.240]   different and they they're actually two experiments in this
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.920]   study. You're welcome to go look at it.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.180]   So it wasn't just about sports.
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:27.640]   There were some other things that were analyzed as well.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.740]   And in the references of this paper,
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:33.040]   it also points to other examples now of the cathedral effect,
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.520]   which I find very interesting because as a vision scientist
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.340]   and someone who spends his life thinking about,
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.960]   and indeed talking about the nervous system,
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:44.600]   we know that our cognition follows our vision for low vision
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.860]   or blind people that will follow their,
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.080]   mostly their hearing and to some extent their touch.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.040]   But for most people who are sighted as most people are
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:56.600]   sighted, our cognition follows our visual environment.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.640]   So what does this mean for workspace optimization?
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.100]   Well, most of us have a fixed ceiling level in our,
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.040]   in our home,
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.440]   but you might have rooms in which the ceiling is higher and
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.720]   rooms in which the ceiling is lower.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.560]   If that were the case,
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.980]   I recommend if you want to do creative work during phase two,
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.840]   the nine to 16 hours of your circadian cycle,
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.160]   nine to 16 hours after waking,
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.200]   that is that you do that in the high ceiling room,
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.960]   or maybe even outdoors out on a deck or on a patio,
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.400]   because the highest ceiling of course is the sky.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.560]   Whereas if you're going to do detailed analytic work in,
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.680]   I would suggest doing that during phase one of the day.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.680]   But even if you're going to do it during phase two of the
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.060]   day, for whatever reason,
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.100]   scheduling or other sorts of constraints that you do that in
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.620]   the lower ceiling environment.
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.220]   Now, if you are interested in controlling your,
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.520]   the height of your visual world,
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.480]   but you don't have control over your,
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.720]   the ceiling height of the environment that you're in,
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.080]   there is another way to do that.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.720]   And I used to observe this in the cafes and around Stanford
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.480]   in the Bay area, where you would see somebody who,
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.240]   despite the weather would be in a hoodie,
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.960]   maybe with a baseball cap or other form of hat,
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.700]   or some sort of blinder above their eyebrows,
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.160]   which is actually another way of just lowering the ceiling
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.760]   height very, very low and restricting your visual field.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.840]   Not unlike blinders that we talked about before,
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.080]   that one would put on a horse or one would put on them
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.560]   themselves by restricting their visual angle of focus to
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.440]   directly in front of them,
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.960]   but not too far out beyond the sides of their head.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.120]   So these cathedral effects I think can be leveraged toward
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.360]   doing particular types of work best.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.380]   And again, the lower the ceiling or the lower your visual
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:27.120]   environment, the more that one tends to do,
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:32.120]   or I should say, performs detailed analytic work accurately.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.520]   And the more that one's thinking is oriented towards
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.480]   detailed sort of correct answer type work.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.560]   Whereas when the ceiling is higher or there's no ceiling,
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:46.120]   the more that the brain and the rest of the processing that
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:49.520]   we call cognitive processing is related to abstract
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.160]   reasoning, brainstorming,
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:55.240]   and indeed can pull from broader swaths of memory resources,
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.420]   because really what abstract reasoning is,
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.680]   is it's taking existing elements and maneuvering them or
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.520]   arranging them into novel ways.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.320]   So you can think about like notes on a piano playing a
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.800]   particular song, learning scales, that's very analytic.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.640]   There's a,
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.680]   there's a correct answer that you're trying to arrive at or
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:14.440]   generate, whereas writing music or writing poetry or
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:19.120]   generating new material of any kind involves taking existing
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:19.960]   elements, right?
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.080]   You're not going to use words that you don't have committed
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.920]   to your memory or that you're not aware of and arranging
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.080]   them in novel ways.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.440]   So I think the cathedral effect can be leveraged.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.280]   And again,
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.960]   you don't need to move into a different home or build a
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.800]   slanted roof and work at one side of the room at one part of
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.160]   the day and the other side of the room at the other.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.600]   Although, Hey, if that's the way you,
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.160]   you want to swing it, that's great.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.020]   Most of us don't have that flexibility,
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:44.520]   but it's very clear that the height of the ceiling of the
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.120]   visual environment that we're in has a profound effect on the
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:50.400]   types of cognitive processes that we are able to engage.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.220]   Now I'd like to shift our attention to the auditory
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:56.120]   environment or the noise in the room or the music in the
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.240]   room or the music or noise in the headphones,
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.660]   because it turns out that there is a lot of quality
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:05.920]   scientific data out there that speaks to whether or not
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:10.280]   listening to particular sounds can enhance our cognition.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:11.800]   And indeed the answer is yes,
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.840]   but there are very particular types of things to listen to
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.860]   under very particular types of conditions that allow one to
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:19.120]   do that.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:19.960]   First off,
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.480]   I want to say that people vary tremendously in the extent to
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.800]   which they can tolerate background noise for work.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.040]   In fact,
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.180]   individuals will vary tremendously from one day to the next,
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.740]   or even within the same day and the extent to which they can
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:35.680]   tolerate background noise.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.040]   I've experienced this myself.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.220]   There've been times in which I've been working at home and I
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:40.940]   felt like for whatever reason,
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.800]   I just could not engage in focus.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:47.720]   And what worked to generate more focus for me was to go to a
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.240]   cafe or to a library or someplace where there's actually
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.480]   more commotion, more people moving about,
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.120]   maybe even more noise, maybe even music in the room.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.400]   And we have to all be in touch with when we want more
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.880]   background noise or when we want less background noise,
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.760]   there is no hard and fast rule.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:07.760]   If you look across the literature for studies that involve
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:12.260]   complete silence or white noise or binaural beats or music or
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.960]   classical music or rock and roll,
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:17.880]   you can find results to support any type of environment as
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.600]   being more beneficial.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.320]   However, as we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.960]   there are a few types of environments to really avoid and a
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:27.720]   few types of sounds that really can enhance the cognition
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.720]   and your ability to focus in your workspace environment
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.540]   across the board that really seemed to work for all people.
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:36.040]   Let's talk about background noise to avoid.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.960]   And here we're talking about background noise to avoid
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.600]   because it actually can cause some pretty severe deficits in
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.780]   cognition.
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:46.680]   There's a paper, first author, Jordan Love, cool name.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.320]   Last author, Alexander Francis.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:53.060]   The title of the paper has to do with psychophysiological
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.920]   responses to potentially annoying heating ventilation and
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.580]   air conditioning noise during mentally demanding work,
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.700]   which is a mouthful, but basically what this paper identifies
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:06.380]   is a large data set in which workplace and environmental
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.460]   noise, mostly the humming of air conditioners,
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.100]   that's very loud or the humming of heaters.
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:11.500]   That's very loud and ongoing,
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:15.380]   just incessant doesn't let up can really increase mental
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:18.940]   fatigue and can vastly decrease cognitive performance.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.300]   And if you're interested in looking at the cognitive
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:25.140]   performance data that authors are Banbury and Berry 2005,
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.760]   that paper is the one that supports the fact that cognitive
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.720]   performance is worse when there's just the hum of an air
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.080]   conditioner in the background or the hum of a heater and
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.800]   otherwise complete silence.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.140]   There's also evidence,
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.340]   which I discussed on the episode about hearing,
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.280]   which is that in young children,
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.000]   white noise can cause some impairments in the development of
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.600]   the auditory system.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.080]   Now I don't want parents to freak out.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.840]   And if you were exposed to white noise as a,
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.220]   as a sleep aid as a child, which I know many of you were,
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.840]   don't freak out, but it turns out that white noise,
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:57.840]   especially if it's loud,
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.720]   white noise can cause some disruption in the auditory maps,
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:04.020]   the representation of different frequencies of sound in the
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:07.040]   brain that can lead to some deficits in auditory and even
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.280]   language processing.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.760]   So we really have to be careful about long-term exposure,
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:15.800]   extended exposure to white noise or an air conditioning
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:17.240]   noise. That's really at a high level.
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.160]   I wouldn't worry if it's in the background and it's shutting
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:23.720]   off and turning on again as the thermostat kicks off and on,
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:28.680]   but really trying to avoid work in loud fan-filled or
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:32.420]   ventilation generating or heat generating environments,
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.360]   because it really can cause damage to the auditory system
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.200]   long-term.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.280]   And as we described,
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.800]   it can impair cognitive performance and overall increased
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.960]   fatigue. I think we've all experienced that when you're in a
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.120]   room and there's some ongoing background noise and all of a
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.320]   sudden it stops and you just feel this enormous relief.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.520]   And the reason for this is that our auditory system has a
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:55.120]   parallel to our visual system in our visual system,
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.200]   that light entering the eyes,
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.280]   triggers the activation of those melanopsin cells,
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.280]   which triggers activation of the hypothalamus,
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.920]   a particular area of the hypothalamus,
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.280]   which generates alertness generates the release,
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:08.360]   even of cortisol, a stress hormone in the auditory system,
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.960]   when there's ongoing sound,
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.900]   your auditory system hears that even if you're not paying
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.740]   attention to it,
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.840]   if you're paying attention to something else,
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.000]   it still registers those little hair cells,
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.040]   as they're called in your inner ear are fluttering.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.600]   The eardrum is beating and in concert to that sound
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.520]   frequency.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.380]   And there's a brainstem mechanism that generates alertness
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.320]   and a kind of vigilance.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.720]   So when you have a sound that's ongoing in the background,
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.600]   it shuts off all of a sudden you experience that piece,
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.840]   which is the turning off of those brainstem circuits that
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.520]   are associated with vigilance, the locus coeruleus,
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.620]   which we talked about earlier,
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.960]   which release epinephrine and norepinephrine and generate
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.180]   that heightened state of alertness in your brain and body.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.760]   Those neurons then can turn off and you experience that as
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.620]   relaxation.
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:51.220]   So does that mean that we shouldn't listen to white noise or
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.480]   pink noise or brown noise while we're working?
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.660]   Certainly a lot of people do.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.760]   In fact, if you want to know what white noise,
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.380]   pink noise and brown noise are,
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.560]   they're just different constellations of auditory frequencies
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.400]   that are played together.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.920]   Most of us think of white noise as the shh on a screen,
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.680]   you know, all the black and white pixels going all around,
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.140]   like they call it visual snow,
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:17.420]   but pink noise has certain sound frequencies notched out,
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.580]   taken out, brown noise has others.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.040]   It has different frequencies that are,
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.600]   that are included at higher amplitude, et cetera.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.900]   You can look this stuff up on YouTube.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.340]   If you want, you just put brown noise.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:27.560]   None of it sounds terrific.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.460]   It doesn't sound like music.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.560]   It's literally just noise,
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.140]   mixed frequencies and no particular arrangement.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.900]   There is some evidence that playing white noise in the
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.840]   background or on headphones or pink noise or brown noise can
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.520]   facilitate cognition,
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.840]   but it's mainly through an increase in this overall
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.360]   alertness as a consequence of areas like locus coeruleus and
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.720]   other brainstem areas that are associated with autonomic
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.360]   arousal from that noise.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.280]   So it's a lot like the air conditioner effect.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.560]   And I think done in a restricted way,
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.280]   meaning not for hours and hours,
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.440]   but maybe if your focus is waning and you're having a hard
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.800]   time engaging in work,
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.040]   you might put on some brown noise or white noise or pink
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.200]   noise and work that way for 45 minutes or so before you go to
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.740]   your panoramic vision walk and get some sunlight,
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.360]   that should be fine.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.480]   There's really no reason to suspect, however,
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.240]   that those particular patterns of noise are going to
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.520]   optimize particular mental functions.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:23.360]   So what I'd like to turn to next are particular patterns of
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.200]   sounds that indeed have been shown in peer reviewed studies
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.080]   to optimize certain types of mental processing,
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.700]   because you can incorporate these into your optimized
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:34.560]   workspace environment through headphones or through
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.600]   speakers, whatever mechanism that you want in order to get
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.600]   more out of your work efforts.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.600]   If you were to search for apps or go online and try and find
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.600]   sounds that can improve thinking or change your emotions,
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.800]   you're generally going to find three types.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.880]   One are called isochronic tones.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.020]   These are tones usually of a common frequency.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.620]   So it might be a beep and then a pause and then beep of the
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:04.000]   same frequency and then beep forgive my terrible beeping.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.640]   I don't know what good beeping would sound like,
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.320]   but contrast isochronic tones with monaural beats.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.400]   Monaural beats would be repetitive,
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.920]   almost percussive like beats delivered to just one ear,
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.480]   tune tune tune tune, this kind of thing, okay?
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.760]   You can find apps that can deliver monaural beats.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.200]   You can find also apps that deliver so-called binaural beats.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.880]   You can also find YouTube scripts that or channels that will
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.660]   deliver binaural beats, binaural beats as the name suggests,
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.080]   are beats delivered to the two ears.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.880]   One pattern of kind of percussive beat to one ear and a
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.400]   different pattern that's,
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.560]   or at least a pattern that's out of phase,
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.200]   that's not synchronized delivered to the other ear.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.160]   So on one ear, you hear, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:48.080]   And then the other ear, you've got, tune tune tune.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.540]   And what happens is because of the way that the auditory
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:54.720]   system converges in the brainstem and generates what are
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.240]   called intraoral time differences.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.400]   I'll explain what that means in a moment.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.320]   Intraoral time differences,
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.480]   the difference between the two patterns of beats that are
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.240]   heard by the each of the two different ears leads to a third
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.280]   pattern that the brain and trains to and kind of maps onto
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.360]   and generates particular types of brain waves, okay?
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.560]   So without going into a lot of detail,
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.040]   intro all time differences are the ways in which if you were
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.380]   to hear something off to your right,
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.200]   like I just snapped my finger just to the right of my right
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:30.200]   ear, that a signal arrives in my right ear before that's
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.440]   sound signal, those sound waves arrive in my left ear.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.680]   So there's an intraoral between ears time difference,
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:41.540]   and there's a brainstem area in which signals from one ear
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.320]   and signals from the other ear converge.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.280]   And there's literally a math done by your nervous system
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.000]   that says this signal arrived before the other signal.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.420]   And the difference between those signals is the intraoral
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.260]   time difference.
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:55.520]   So if I were to snap my fingers on both sides,
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.560]   on my left end, on my right side at the exact same time,
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.120]   and they arrive at the same time,
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.600]   the intro all time difference is zero.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.660]   Whereas if one goes first on the right and then the left,
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:05.860]   I'm terrible at snapping on the left.
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.700]   It's a weak snap, but it was there.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.860]   Then there's a delay in the intro all time difference
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.140]   has a particular value.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:11.980]   Okay, you get it.
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:13.800]   It's almost ridiculously simple.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.800]   Binaural beats have been generated in ways that create a
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.380]   particular pattern of intro all time differences that then
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:26.620]   cascades up to the rest of the brain and puts the forebrain
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.740]   and other areas of the brain that are involved in cognition
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.880]   and action into a particular rhythm.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.300]   And some of the rhythms were waves of brain activity are
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:37.120]   ones that you may have heard of things like alpha waves or
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.280]   theta waves or gamma waves.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.580]   Now I don't like to get too attached to particular brain
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.720]   waves as excellent for particular kinds of thinking.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.780]   This is something that was really popular in the nineties
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:51.120]   and two thousands when ways of measuring brain activity
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.920]   noninvasively with electrodes on the outside enabled people
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.920]   to identify the indeed alpha brain waves are associated with
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.800]   alertness states and some are other brain waves that are
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:05.220]   kind of larger amplitude, slow waves, like, you know,
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.760]   delta waves are associated with kind of sleepiness or
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.920]   relaxation.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.760]   But in general,
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.960]   the way that the brain works is that different brain waves
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.880]   are generated in different structures at different times.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.120]   And those combine to give us a sense of happiness or give us
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.340]   a sense of focus or give us a sense of creativity.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.260]   Nonetheless,
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:25.680]   if you look across the board at the studies of binaural
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.860]   beats and you ask what sorts of binaural beats appear to be
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:33.440]   useful for people to enhance their brain function for
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.960]   particular kinds of tasks,
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.720]   we arrive at some very interesting answers.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.640]   So we'll review what those are now.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:43.040]   The frequency of binaural beats that appears to bring about
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:47.520]   improved cognitive functioning at the level of memory,
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.660]   improved reaction times and improved verbal recall
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:55.380]   seems to be 40 Hertz.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.480]   Now, is it exactly 40 Hertz?
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.420]   We don't know,
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:01.880]   but if one wants to look up a great reference on this,
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:06.880]   they reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al, 2017,
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.160]   describes in here, I'm quoting.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.000]   So this is a direct quote.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.720]   "The present findings are in line with those of a recent
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.100]   study, which also found faster reaction times and
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.320]   participants that listen to binaural beats of 40 Hertz."
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.240]   And you can find many examples of this in the literature
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:24.640]   where binaural beats of about 40 Hertz or exactly 40 Hertz
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.200]   in some cases, somehow brought the brain into a state that
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.460]   made it optimal for learning, for memory,
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:32.780]   and for certain types of recall,
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.380]   including verbal recall, math, learning, et cetera.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.340]   So for those of you that are interested in binaural beats,
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.320]   there are a number of free apps out there.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.660]   I'm not going to recommend any in particular,
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:45.020]   just have to search for one that you happen to like.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.760]   One thing that you will find is that many of those apps
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:53.760]   super impose binaural beats onto raindrops or ocean sounds,
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.660]   or that rather they superimpose ocean sounds and raindrops
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:57.980]   onto the binaural beats.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:01.100]   That does not appear to be as effective as pure binaural
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.500]   beats.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.620]   There has been an exploration of lower frequency binaural
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.140]   beats. So for instance, seven Hertz,
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.260]   which is theta binaural beats done for 30 minutes with an
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.480]   overlay of rain sound or rain sounds only that's been
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.580]   analyzed and believe it or not,
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.460]   that showed immediate recall memory was significantly
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.740]   decreased. Okay?
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:23.520]   So that's a negative effect of binaural beats on memory.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.060]   So the idea that binaural beats are just great for us across
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.500]   the board, I think is wrong.
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.700]   It does appear that the higher frequency binaural beats as
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.140]   one moves up toward 40 Hertz are going to be the most
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.600]   beneficial.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.180]   There are instances in which for instance,
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.660]   15 Hertz binaural beats increased response accuracy on a
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.460]   spatial verbal memory task.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:46.380]   This is a complicated working memory task.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.860]   Working memory is the kind of memory of remembering a phone
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:51.780]   number. So if I say for instance,
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:55.540]   4932931 and you have to remember that number,
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:58.380]   keeping it online is what we call your working memory.
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:00.260]   It's likely that you would forget that two or three days
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.100]   later,
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.680]   you can get improvements in working memory with 15 Hertz
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.220]   binaural beats.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.260]   Whereas the other control conditions,
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.020]   five Hertz and 10 Hertz binaural beats,
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.260]   all decreased accuracy of working memory.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.100]   However,
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.420]   when I look at the literature and I examined a number of
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.980]   different studies,
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:21.500]   what I always seem to come back to was that 40 Hertz or so
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:25.980]   plus or minus five Hertz seem to be optimal for generating
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:28.780]   improvements in cognition and math performance.
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:32.380]   And even in various types of memory recall and even in
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.860]   musical performance, you might wonder, well,
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.340]   how can people do musical performance?
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:36.980]   They're listening to binaural beats.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.820]   Here's another surprise.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:41.700]   Many of the studies that I looked at didn't have people
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.260]   listening to binaural beats while they were doing the tasks,
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.420]   the memory task or the music learning, et cetera.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.820]   They would do it beforehand for 30 minutes.
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:51.340]   There were instances in which people were listening to
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:53.100]   binaural beats during the task.
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.860]   But if you decide to employ binaural beats,
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.100]   I recommend this 40 Hertz as a great place to start.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.740]   I don't recommend doing it for all of your work bouts.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:03.340]   I think there's a good reason to believe that you could
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.780]   attenuate to it, but if you are going to try it,
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:06.780]   you might try it both ways.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.060]   You might try listening to binaural beats for about 30
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.700]   minutes while doing something else,
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.900]   and then maybe eating lunch or something of that sort or
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:15.660]   taking a walk and then going into the work bout.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:18.620]   Because remember the moment that you start listening to
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.460]   these binaural beats,
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.980]   the brain doesn't immediately switch into a particular
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.580]   pattern of oscillation or brainwaves.
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.420]   It takes some time.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.740]   Neural circuits, again, take time to engage.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.320]   The only neural circuits that are going to engage instantly
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.040]   are going to the ones that are of a sort of reflexive sort,
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.920]   like you step on a sharp object and you have to retract
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.760]   your limb,
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.920]   or you suddenly are stressed by a distressing text message,
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.280]   or you're suddenly delighted about a delightful text message.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.880]   But when it comes to shifting your whole brain state toward
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.760]   optimizing work, it takes a little bit of time.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:51.340]   So again, 40 Hertz binaural beats, many, many apps,
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:53.220]   many YouTube scripts out there,
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.260]   probably other resources for binaural beats,
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.220]   hopefully zero costs.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.620]   So you can access those without any need to shell out any
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:00.460]   money.
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.580]   If you find one that you particularly like,
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.780]   maybe put it in the comment section so other people can find
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:06.100]   it at YouTube would be the best place to do that.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.740]   Feel free to put a link or just a description that will be
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.020]   wonderful.
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.760]   And again,
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.960]   you don't need to listen to binaural beats at the exact same
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:14.920]   time that you're doing the work.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.920]   Although that could also enhance your productivity.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.040]   Some of you out there might be craving a little bit more
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.140]   mechanism by which binaural beats can influence things like
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:25.360]   focus or reduced reaction time.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.380]   This has actually been explored.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:32.000]   This 40 Hertz binaural beats pattern seems to have an effect
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.340]   on what's called striatal dopamine.
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:36.560]   We have dopamine as a neuromodulator, of course,
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.520]   involved in many things in motivation.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.960]   It's actually involved in adaptation to light in the retina,
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.800]   something that most people don't know,
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.480]   but it's involved in movement, which is why people with
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.020]   Parkinson's who have a depletion of dopamine neurons
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:50.080]   actually have movement deficits and so on.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.120]   But striatal dopamine is closely related to motivation and
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:59.120]   focus and 40 Hertz binaural beats appears to increase
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.360]   striatal dopamine release.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.780]   And this has actually been measured indirectly by what we
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.760]   call spontaneous blink rate.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.360]   Now I've been accused on various Instagram posts and even on
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:12.620]   this podcast of being a non blinker, let's call it,
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.140]   or a minimal blinker.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:18.680]   And as an important aside, there is no evidence whatsoever
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.800]   that people that don't blink very much are sociopaths or lie.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:25.400]   Also, you will hear that people who blink a lot are
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.220]   sociopaths and are lying.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:29.660]   There is absolutely no evidence that blink frequency
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.680]   correlates with anything except alertness.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.840]   Now, longer blinks are associated with less alertness.
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.680]   As we get tired,
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.880]   we tend to blink longer and longer until we take the long
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.180]   blink that is sleep.
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:42.760]   I guess the long blink would be death,
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.320]   but the long ish blink would be sleep.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.800]   But it turns out that the more firing of striatal dopamine
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:54.200]   neurons that's occurring, the more frequently we blink.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.840]   And so it is associated with a resetting of our visual
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.320]   window. That's what happens when we blink.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.740]   And there's a whole relationship between blinking and time
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.460]   perception that we covered in the episode on time
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.440]   perception.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.280]   But here's the bottom line for sake of this discussion.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.220]   40 Hertz binaural beats appears to increase spontaneous
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.800]   blink rates because it increases dopamine transmission in
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.280]   the brainstem and in the striatum in several locations,
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.120]   in fact.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.680]   And so the way in which these binaural beats set a rhythm in
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.080]   the brain recruits dopamine release,
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.680]   that dopamine release leads to heightened levels of
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.720]   motivation and focus. Why motivation and focus?
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.560]   Well,
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.040]   dopamine is actually the substrate by which epinephrine is
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:33.880]   made dopamine.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.280]   The molecule is actually converted into epinephrine
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.960]   adrenaline, and they work together like close cousins,
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.860]   dopamine and epinephrine in order to put us on a path of
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:42.700]   movement,
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:45.680]   or if we are doing work of mental movement toward a goal.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.020]   So that's a little bit of mechanistic meat to explain at
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:52.420]   least part of the reason why 40 Hertz binaural beats can
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:53.740]   enhance our focus,
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:56.120]   reduce our reaction times and improve indeed learning and
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:56.960]   memory.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.220]   Next I'd like to talk about the role of movement in
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:02.960]   optimizing our workspace and whether or not standing,
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.500]   sitting, lying down, treadmilling, or even believe it or not,
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:10.520]   cycling can enhance our work output and performance.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.360]   Before we do that,
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.160]   I want to touch on two aspects of optimizing workspace that
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.040]   will come up at some point in your work or school life.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.660]   Alas, there isn't a lot of science around this,
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:23.800]   but I think they are worth mentioning.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.240]   And I think I can offer a little bit of advice in terms of
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.520]   how to navigate these in a way that would be beneficial to
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.000]   you. The first one is interruptions. You know,
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.160]   if you go online and you ask about, you know,
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.320]   how to avoid interruptions, people will say, okay, well,
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.720]   if you have kids at home, or even if you don't or at work,
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.320]   you'll have a light, like a recording,
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.860]   like with recording is on we're we're busy now,
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.640]   or have a sign on the door that says bother only in the case
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.380]   of emergency or fine to knock or don't knock at all.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:51.220]   I've used a different policy throughout the years.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.060]   I am somebody who works pretty hard to control my time and
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:58.500]   focus. But of course, as a laboratory director,
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.620]   I have people coming by and who want to talk about things.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:04.120]   And of course we have phones and we have computers and
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.080]   people's opportunity to reach us.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.720]   Interruptions really are deadly to our ability to generate
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.560]   focus.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.880]   And it's not just about the distraction that occurs of say a
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.860]   minute or two minutes or five minutes when we were
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:17.700]   interrupted.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.400]   It's also about the additional time to get those brain
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.720]   circuits re-engaged to a mode of focus.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.520]   So it's really kind of a double whammy.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.980]   Now, none of us,
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:29.680]   including myself want to be harsh or cruel or shut off from
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.520]   the world.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.900]   And oftentimes interruptions bring incredible insights and
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:36.060]   people are providing support and very useful things that are
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.800]   essential to my workday and presumably to your workday and
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.420]   school day as well.
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:44.020]   But there's a simple method that I learned from my graduate
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:45.900]   advisor that works very, very well.
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.580]   Again, no peer review data support it.
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.400]   This is just my experience,
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:52.500]   but this is somebody who had immense powers of focus,
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.540]   had a very, very demanding life, a long commute to children,
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.380]   extensive laboratory, et cetera.
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:01.680]   And what she would do was if I came by and asked a question,
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.860]   or if anyone came by and asked a question,
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.340]   she would acknowledge their presence but would not shift her
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:07.460]   body toward them.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:10.480]   So she purposely did not position her computer facing the
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.220]   door, which I think is a deadly,
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:16.660]   or I should say deadly to focus a way of positioning your
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:17.500]   workspace.
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:18.900]   So her computer was facing the wall.
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:21.340]   The door was perpendicular to that.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.980]   And I would come by and I say, I have a question.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.000]   And she would say, yes.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.200]   So she would acknowledge my presence,
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.680]   but she wouldn't actually orient her body toward me,
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.120]   which told me that this conversation was not going to last
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:30.960]   very long.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.660]   And no matter how long I stood there, what I asked,
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:34.000]   she would never orient toward me,
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.700]   which generally kept these conversations very, very short.
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.060]   We had other designated meetings where we would be face to
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.600]   face the other approach, which I confess colleagues of mine
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.460]   have used before, not necessarily at Stanford,
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:49.660]   but elsewhere is to simply say no to everything that's
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.420]   somebody requests or comes by.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.880]   So if someone would knock on the door,
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.080]   they would just shout no through the door.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.980]   Or if someone would say, can I bother you for a second?
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.540]   They would say no, or someone say,
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:16:59.500]   I have something I want to tell you.
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.420]   They would just say no.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:02.140]   And they would just continue doing this until the person
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:02.980]   went away.
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:04.060]   That was actually very effective.
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.940]   These were some of the most productive people I know,
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:09.680]   not always the kindest people,
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.300]   but some of them were very kind.
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.180]   The other approach that I've seen, and actually,
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:17.260]   this is an approach that was used by someone who has been a
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.740]   guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:22.320]   someone who's immensely productive, was that he,
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.140]   so I'm constraining who this might be by saying he,
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.620]   he actually,
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:30.220]   despite having the option to have a very large office,
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:35.060]   would place himself in a workspace that was literally a coat
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:39.260]   closet cleared out with a desk, small lamp, completely dark.
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:42.660]   So this violates everything that I've talked about before,
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:45.020]   or prior to this, everything about high ceilings,
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.980]   bright light, et cetera, and would work,
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:51.000]   still works underneath a desk lamp in a completely dark
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.020]   closet, minimal ventilation.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.460]   This is my definition of hell and yet is one of the most
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:58.100]   productive people on the planet.
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.740]   Also very, very hard to find.
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.260]   I actually know where his closet is.
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.380]   It turns out he has several of them that he migrates from
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.380]   in order to avoid distractions.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.020]   So I mentioned these as kind of extremes.
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:09.660]   I think that most of us exist on the other extreme.
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.500]   And that's why I mention it,
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:14.500]   which is that most of us like some social engagement and
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.420]   kind of welcome, or at least set our work environment
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.140]   in a way that welcomes interruption.
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:21.180]   And we have to be very, very careful about this.
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:22.900]   Now in the digital realm,
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:25.900]   I already mentioned a few of the things that we can do
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:28.740]   as practical tools to limit interruptions.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:30.300]   One is to use the program freedom.
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:32.620]   The other would be to simply turn off the wifi.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:34.740]   If you do need to be online and navigating,
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.260]   you're doing research of any kind,
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.660]   that's not going to be possible.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.060]   Turning off one's phone.
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:41.900]   I've at times put my phone on airplane mode.
[01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:43.700]   If that didn't work, I've locked it in a safe.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.420]   I've done that. I've left it in the car outside.
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.340]   It all depends on one's levels of self-discipline,
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:49.940]   which as you probably know from your own experience,
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.340]   tends to kind of wax and wane.
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:54.200]   Sometimes we are better at avoiding these distractions
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:55.040]   than others.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.740]   So if you find yourself in a place where it's very hard to
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.220]   reduce those distractions,
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:01.620]   you may need to go to more elaborate lengths.
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:04.780]   I will say that a graduate student in my lab
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:06.860]   who was immensely productive and focused
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:09.160]   had the habit of coming in each day.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.020]   She would take her phone.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.980]   I don't know if she turned it on, off or not.
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:14.860]   And she would just place it in a door, excuse me,
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:18.720]   in a drawer and would then go start doing experiments.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.740]   We do experiments all day at 10 courses,
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.980]   engage in discussions avidly with the rest of us,
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.220]   and then would take her phone out
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:26.020]   at the end of the day and leave.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:29.820]   And I don't think that behavior was not correlated
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.660]   with her immense productivity.
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:35.820]   I think the ability to untether ourselves from the phone
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:38.300]   is going to be the way in which many of us
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.380]   are either going to succeed or fail in our various pursuits.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.440]   I'm somebody who engages with the phone on a regular basis
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.340]   throughout the day for various reasons,
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.460]   but I do try and have large swaths of the day
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:50.080]   in which it's either on airplane mode
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.260]   or it's completely physically separated from me.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:53.860]   And when I mean large swaths,
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.780]   I might do every other hour with the phone on airplane mode
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:58.720]   or even a two or three hour bout
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:01.620]   where I just am simply not engaged with the phone at all.
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:04.360]   So is it better to sit or is it better to stand
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.320]   when doing work,
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.820]   at least as it relates to focus and productivity?
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.060]   And the answer is both.
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:13.540]   There've been a number of systematic studies exploring
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.620]   what are called sit-stand desks.
[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:18.760]   So these are desks that can be set to a height
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:22.220]   that makes standing the best practice,
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:24.300]   and then they can be lowered to a height
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:26.480]   that makes sitting the best practice
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.500]   or the easiest practice, I should say.
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:33.460]   And it turns out that just sitting is terrible for us, okay?
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:36.080]   And there's an enormous number of studies out there
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:39.860]   that point to the fact that people who sit for five or six
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:43.340]   or seven hours a day doing work have all sorts of issues
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:46.640]   related to sleep, neck pain, cognition suffers,
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.220]   the number of cardiovascular effects, even digestion.
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:52.460]   There may even actually be some almost pressure effects
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:54.380]   on the pelvic floor and things of that sort,
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:56.780]   depending on the chairs that one uses,
[01:20:56.780 --> 01:21:01.180]   but that people who stand are in a slightly better situation
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:04.140]   where many of those health metrics improve,
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.140]   but that people that do a combination of sitting
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:07.940]   and standing at the same desk throughout the day
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:09.800]   or move from one desk to another,
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.600]   if they don't have a combination sit-stand desk,
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.660]   that's going to be best.
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:16.100]   The good news is it's very easy to convert a sit desk
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:16.940]   into a stand desk.
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:17.980]   You can just stack some boxes.
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:19.900]   I've done this at times or stack books.
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:21.400]   There are also some pedestals and things
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.020]   that you can purchase if that's your preference
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.780]   in order to set your computer at a particular height.
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.280]   And of course, there are desks that have motors
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.420]   and there are ones that have cranks
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:31.020]   and there are all sorts of variations,
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.420]   both in terms of the types and whether or not
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.180]   they have motors, as well as the cost to these things.
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:37.580]   So they can go from very low cost,
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:41.440]   like placing boxes or books to create a standing desk
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.660]   to very high cost in some cases.
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.980]   Now, what's interesting,
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:47.780]   if you look at the scientific literature,
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:51.620]   is that people who decreased their sitting time
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.540]   by about half each day.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:55.700]   So they took, let's say they were working
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:57.360]   for seven hours a day,
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.600]   three and a half hours of that day, they decide to stand.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:02.100]   And it's not even clear that it matters
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.160]   that they do all those three hours in one bout
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.960]   or they divide that up into shorter bouts of a half an hour
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.220]   and then sit for half an hour, et cetera,
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:09.700]   alternating back and forth,
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.580]   showed incredibly significant effects
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.860]   on reduced neck and shoulder pain,
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:16.260]   increase in subjective health,
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:18.780]   vitality in work-related environments,
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:20.100]   and perhaps most importantly,
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.660]   for sake of today's discussion,
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:25.380]   improvement in cognitive conditioning
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:27.940]   and the ability to embrace new tasks
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:29.840]   and cognitive performance.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:32.000]   There are several studies that if one wanted to explore,
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.180]   they could explore this in more detail.
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:36.520]   I'll put a link to this as well.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.700]   The article that I'm referring to is called
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.760]   Effect of Workplace Sit-Stand Desk Intervention
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.420]   on Health and Productivity.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:46.140]   And I like this paper because many of the papers out there
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:49.660]   focus on the effects of sit-stand desks on health
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.420]   in trying to get people to burn more calories,
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:54.100]   improve their posture, relieve neck pain,
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:56.940]   slumped over, et cetera, but not on productivity.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:57.900]   And this particular paper
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.460]   focuses also on the metrics of productivity.
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:01.460]   It has its own study
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.660]   and also references a number of important studies.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:04.860]   What does this mean for you and me?
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.900]   Well, I've long used a standing desk
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:08.540]   or some variation thereof.
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.220]   What this means is that we should probably spend
[01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:12.380]   about half of our work time standing
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:14.420]   and about half of it sitting,
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:16.800]   but not all sitting or not all standing.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.980]   If you had to do all one or the other,
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:21.220]   standing is going to be better than sitting.
[01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:23.060]   What happens if we just stand?
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:26.380]   Well, that can also generate some postural issues
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.780]   in terms of stabilization and fatigue.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:31.840]   I have a good friend who's in the movement
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.780]   and physical rehabilitation and physiology space.
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:36.580]   His name is Kelly Starrett.
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:39.220]   He's very impressive in all those domains.
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.840]   And he always says, we weren't designed to sit all day,
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.660]   but we also weren't designed to stand all day.
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:44.500]   And I think that's true.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.060]   If we were to look back at our species
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:48.980]   over tens or hundreds or thousands of years,
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.140]   we would find that indeed we did sit down.
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:52.020]   We did lie down.
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.100]   It wasn't that we were standing all day long.
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:57.420]   That said, most everybody, at least in the US,
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:01.340]   is not getting sufficient cardiovascular exercise
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.660]   or movement throughout the day.
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:05.200]   And standing at one's desk can improve
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.580]   some of those health metrics
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.580]   and again can improve productivity,
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.940]   probably because of those postural effects
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:12.340]   that I talked about earlier,
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.620]   that when we lie down,
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:16.880]   there tends to be less alertness in our brainstem,
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:17.720]   if you will.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.380]   There's less activation of those brainstem circuits
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.440]   involved in alertness.
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.620]   And indeed that circuits that involve
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:26.100]   a kind of a calming effect on the body get activated.
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:30.220]   And as we become upright, standing or sitting,
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.740]   but especially standing,
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:34.500]   then those brainstem circuits for alertness kick on,
[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.480]   which are going to make it easier to remain focused.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.220]   If you are going to start standing
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:40.420]   for half of your work time,
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:42.420]   you will notice that it takes a few days to adapt.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:44.880]   You'll notice a lot of shifting from side to side.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.300]   Definitely want to wear comfortable shoes.
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:48.060]   Some people will do this on a wooden floor.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:50.240]   Other people feel uncomfortable unless they're on carpet.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.660]   You have to figure out what works for you,
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.700]   but it can take a little bit of time to adapt.
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:54.740]   I have to say after now,
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:58.500]   about 10 years of working at a sit-stand desk,
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.740]   I find I can't sit for too long before I want to stand.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.440]   And my standing bouts can be anywhere
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.620]   from 30 minutes to two hours,
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:06.000]   although two hours would be a little bit long.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.420]   And then I catch myself kind of leaning
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:08.920]   on the desk off to the side.
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.580]   So again, the idea is to stand,
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:13.040]   but not be leaning on the desk.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.460]   Obviously, if you're typing or you're writing,
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:15.700]   there'll be some leaning involved,
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:17.760]   but that's what the literature support.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.920]   There is also a literature on whether or not
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.740]   physical movement under your desk, meaning treadmilling,
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:26.680]   or in fact, there are now bicycles
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.260]   that allow people to pedal.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:30.020]   It's kind of a unicycle like thing,
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.300]   although not a unicycle under the desk,
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.840]   can be beneficial for workplace performance.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.920]   So let's take a look at what those data say.
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.260]   The study that I'm referring to has a first author,
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:44.040]   Frodsham, F-R-O-D-S-H-A-M, Frodsham et al.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.300]   This is a research article published in PLOS One.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.060]   And the title of the article is,
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:52.500]   "Does type of active workstation matter?
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.500]   A randomized comparison of cognitive
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:57.060]   and typing performance between rest, cycling,
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:59.100]   and treadmill active workstations."
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:00.380]   It's amazing that people do this science.
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:01.720]   I think it's great.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.060]   Where else would we get peer reviewed data
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:05.920]   on these types of questions?
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.980]   First things first, there were no significant differences
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.140]   between cycling or treadmill workstations
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:13.380]   on any cognitive or typing outcomes.
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:15.780]   So it does not seem to matter
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:18.260]   whether or not people are treadmilling under the desk.
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:20.180]   So these would be stationary treadmills.
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:22.800]   It's like a little conveyor that people are walking on,
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.060]   sometimes very slowly.
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:25.540]   I'm guessing some people walk more quickly.
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:27.560]   The New Yorker's probably treadmill quicker.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:30.140]   The Californian's probably treadmill a little slower.
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:33.220]   I'm a Californian, so I can make that quote unquote joke.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.860]   But nonetheless, there were no significant differences
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:37.460]   between that and a cycling station
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:40.740]   where people are sitting and pedaling as they type away
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:43.260]   or as they work or as they're on phone calls, et cetera.
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.380]   So it really doesn't seem to matter.
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:47.380]   So if you're going to embrace these active workstations,
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:51.240]   as they're called, just decide what you would prefer to use.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.280]   It doesn't seem to matter in terms of outcomes.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.280]   Now, this study involved looking at 137 young adults.
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:03.480]   They had multiple sessions where they,
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.340]   at first, completed cognitive and typing tests.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:07.540]   These tests have different names,
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:09.700]   and you're welcome to look those up if you like,
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.160]   as well as flanker tasks.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.840]   So these are tasks of attention and things of that sort.
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.280]   And then they either engaged in treadmill or cycling,
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.020]   and then there was a comparison.
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.040]   And the statistics were run.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.600]   And basically what they found was
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.360]   there was a statistically significant improvement
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.840]   in attention and cognitive control scores
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.560]   during any kind of active session
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:32.400]   as opposed to just a mere seated session.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.280]   Okay, so they compared seated to cycling to treadmilling.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.600]   However, verbal memory scores actually got worse
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.680]   during active sessions.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.280]   So I'll repeat that.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.000]   Treadmilling or the cycling workstations
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.600]   improved attention and cognitive control scores
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:52.600]   as compared to people that were just seated and working.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:55.520]   However, verbal memory scores got worse
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.600]   during the active sessions.
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.780]   And again, just to repeat,
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:59.240]   there was no difference between cycling
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.800]   and treadmill workstations.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:01.720]   So this is interesting.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.380]   It suggests that, as the authors say,
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:06.920]   that active workstations, whether walking or cycling,
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:09.060]   are not only useful to improve caloric output
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:12.160]   and physical activity, circulation, and so on,
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:15.400]   but particularly when completing tasks like cognitive tasks
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.520]   or tasks that require focus
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.800]   that do not require verbal memory recall.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:23.040]   Now, why verbal memory recall was negatively impacted,
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.040]   we don't know.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:25.920]   Could be because people were breathing a little bit harder.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:28.280]   Could be that there's something about walking and talking
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.860]   that seems incompatible in the nervous system,
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:32.000]   although I'm not aware of that.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.760]   I know a number of people who can walk and talk
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:34.960]   at the same time.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.720]   But if you are going to explore these treadmills
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.480]   or you're going to explore these cycling stations,
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.740]   you probably wouldn't want to do that
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.640]   for highly verbal work,
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.400]   maybe more for mathematical work or for analytic work
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.680]   or even creative work,
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:49.800]   but anything that involves very precise
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.860]   or detailed verbal recall,
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:56.120]   sitting or standing seems to be the better option.
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.740]   And if you're wondering why cycling or treadmilling
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:02.920]   would enhance various aspects of cognition,
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.560]   we can speculate.
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.000]   I've talked before about this,
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.040]   but anytime we are generating forward movement
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.760]   through our own actions, our own efforts,
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.120]   typically if we are outside, we're not on a treadmill
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.120]   or we're on a bicycle or we're running
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.360]   or even on a motorcycle or in a car,
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.960]   we have what's called optic flow.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:25.120]   And that optic flow is known to quiet certain areas
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.080]   of the brain that are associated with vigilance
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:27.920]   and indeed fear.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.660]   This is the basis of things like EMDR,
[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:33.320]   eye movement to sensitization reprocessing.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:37.220]   However, the mere act of engaging what are called
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.640]   our central pattern generators,
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.400]   the neurons in our brainstem and in our spinal cord
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.760]   that engage repetitive movements
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:46.060]   also can reduce some of the areas of the brain
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.820]   that are associated with anxiety and vigilance.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:49.560]   So one pure speculation,
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.600]   but nonetheless grounded speculation
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.680]   would be that treadmilling or cycling at a desk
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.800]   would reduce anxiety that would allow performance
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:57.740]   to improve.
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:00.740]   The other, what I think is more likely explanation
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:02.880]   is that anytime we are in ambulation,
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.460]   we recruit the release of neuromodulators
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:08.120]   like epinephrine, dopamine, and things of that sort
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.660]   that further increase overall levels of alertness.
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:12.280]   I think that's the more likely explanation
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.620]   because it's hard to imagine how just a reduction
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:17.680]   in anxiety could lead to these improvements
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.540]   in cognition in a direct way.
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:22.300]   Whereas the subjects in the study I just mentioned
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:26.360]   on average experienced an increase in cognitive performance
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.920]   merely by movement, okay?
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:30.380]   And this does not include any optic flow
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:31.360]   because it's stationary,
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.280]   the treadmill or the cycle is stationary.
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:35.320]   And so we can rule out that optic flow.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:39.200]   And that points to the idea that when we are in movement,
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.260]   we recruit neuromodulators associated
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:43.160]   with the so-called reticular activating system,
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.000]   the striatal system and so forth
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.820]   that would place the brain into some pattern.
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:50.120]   We don't know, we only can speculate some pattern,
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.760]   perhaps it's gamma waves or some other wave pattern
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:55.560]   that would engage heightened levels of focus and attention.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:59.500]   Nonetheless, treadmilling, cycling at a desk
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:00.960]   does improve cognition.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.580]   So we've been discussing workspace optimization
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:06.460]   with the understanding that you're not always going to work
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.060]   in the same place every day.
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:11.060]   What I've tried to do is give you a set
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:13.700]   of high potency tools that can improve your focus
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:16.680]   in cognition and to place that within a framework
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:18.200]   for particular kinds of work.
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.300]   Let's just review some of the basic elements
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.640]   of what we've covered today.
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.240]   First of all, in the first part of your day,
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.320]   that zero to nine hours after waking,
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:28.440]   you want bright lights, especially overhead lights,
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.800]   as bright as you can keep them
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.300]   without feeling uncomfortable
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:33.760]   or certainly not without feeling any pain in your eyes
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.280]   or elsewhere in your body.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.880]   Bright lights make for the maximum state of alertness.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:42.480]   In addition, try and place whatever it is
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.440]   that you're focusing on directly in front of you,
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:45.920]   but not have it extend too far out
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:47.640]   to either side of your eyes.
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.320]   Try and generate a fairly restricted visual window
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.460]   as we call it.
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:54.860]   And if you can try and place whatever it is
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:57.540]   you're focusing on, at least at nose level or above.
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:59.560]   That might take some engineering
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:01.640]   or some ingenuity and creativity
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.860]   in order to figure out how to do that,
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:04.980]   but that's going to be most beneficial.
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:07.620]   Try and avoid reclining, try and avoid sitting,
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:11.020]   try and stand for at least half of your workday.
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:11.940]   That's a good goal.
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:14.480]   And it may take some time to work up to that goal.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.940]   In addition, if you're going to use sound
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:19.980]   as a stimulus for increasing focus and alertness,
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:22.720]   try and avoid exposure to white noise, pink noise,
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:25.360]   or brown noise for extended periods of time
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:26.920]   for more than an hour or so.
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.880]   That might actually be damaging to the auditory system.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.360]   And at the very least is kind of stressful,
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.480]   even though you might not notice it,
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.540]   it's kind of a background level of anxiety and stress
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:37.160]   that is not going to serve you well.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.120]   Rather, if you're going to pursue
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.200]   particular types of sound frequencies,
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.760]   consider using 40 Hertz binaural beats,
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:47.560]   not monaural beats, but 40 Hertz binaural beats
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.860]   done during a particular work bout
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:53.180]   or for 30 minutes prior to that work bout.
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:55.980]   I would not rely on binaural beats all the time every day.
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:58.460]   I think that could cause them to lose their potency
[01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.800]   just because of the way the auditory system attenuates.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:02.500]   And actually you've experienced that attenuation.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.240]   The mere fact that you can go into an environment
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.800]   where there's an air conditioner blowing,
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.000]   blowing, blowing, and then it stops
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.100]   and you feel that relaxation,
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:10.440]   but you weren't thinking about the air conditioner before,
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:11.760]   tells you that your auditory system
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.180]   had kind of attenuated to it,
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.320]   and yet it was still impacting your system.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:18.620]   You were sensing it, we would say, but not perceiving it.
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:20.600]   There are other things that you can do
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.480]   to improve your workspace optimization,
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.880]   such as standing for half the day, as I mentioned before,
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:28.760]   but if you're interested in this
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.040]   or you feel like it suits you to treadmill,
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.520]   find a stationary treadmill that you can walk on.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.240]   I've never tried this before, maybe after this episode,
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:38.280]   given what I've read in the peer-reviewed research,
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.840]   and it's pretty compelling,
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:42.200]   that treadmilling seems like an interesting way
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.780]   to increase alertness and cognitive performance.
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:47.720]   I'm not sure that I would do the cycling method
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.580]   'cause I can't imagine just cycling and typing
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:51.500]   at the same time, that sort of feels like,
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.880]   I actually can do the rub your tummy pat,
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:54.900]   top of your head kind of thing,
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:56.700]   but it still feels like a little bit
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:34:01.040]   of a sort of a cognitive motor collision for me,
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.120]   for whatever reason, but that's just my bias.
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.420]   I do know how to ride a bicycle,
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:06.500]   but anyway, you pick your preference.
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:07.780]   Some other things that you could do
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:10.600]   in order to improve your workplace performance
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.060]   would be to consider the cathedral effect.
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:15.220]   If you're going to do analytic work
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:17.180]   for any part of the day, phase one or phase two,
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:20.080]   as I described them, but really in any time of day,
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.400]   that detailed analytic work
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.260]   for which there is a correct answer,
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.340]   learning scales of music, learning mathematics,
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:27.180]   trying to figure out the solution to a problem
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.680]   where there is indeed a solution.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:31.060]   It could be an interpersonal problem as well.
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:32.580]   Then try and get into an environment
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.100]   with a relatively low ceiling.
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:36.060]   If you don't have access to a low ceiling environment,
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:39.020]   you might consider using a brimmed hat or even a hoodie,
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.000]   or even just facing down,
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.460]   or even putting your hand above your eyes, as you will,
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:46.420]   at the level of your eyebrows.
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:47.620]   In other words, lower the ceiling.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:49.620]   That's the basis of the cathedral effects
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:52.400]   on analytic performance.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.820]   In contrast, if you're interested in doing brainstorming,
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:59.100]   creative work, you're writing new things,
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.300]   you're creating new things of any kind, artwork,
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:02.820]   consider getting into a high ceiling
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:04.900]   or no ceiling environment.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:06.440]   Or if you're wearing a brimmed hat
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.920]   or you're wearing a hoodie, maybe peel that back.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:12.020]   Again, the data within the peer-reviewed literature
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:14.900]   are there to support these sorts of practices.
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.700]   And if you'd like to start layering these protocols,
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.420]   by all means, please do that.
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:20.900]   There's no reason why you couldn't do one
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:22.940]   or just two of these protocols.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:24.340]   There's no reason why, for instance,
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:25.860]   you couldn't use binaural beats
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.200]   and try and get into a low ceiling environment
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.740]   to do detailed work a couple of times a week,
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.980]   but you could also employ all of these.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:35.320]   Now, of course, there are an enormous number of other things
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:38.580]   that you can do to improve work performance and productivity.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:40.560]   And I've talked about those in previous episodes,
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.740]   in particular, in the episode on focus
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:44.580]   and the episode on motivation.
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:46.540]   There are supplements you can take
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.220]   that can increase dopamine, for instance.
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:51.620]   There are tools that you can use to increase your focus.
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.940]   For instance, focusing your visual attention
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:56.700]   on one location for 30 to 60 seconds
[01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:58.740]   prior to entering a focused work bout.
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:00.560]   This has been shown again and again
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.200]   through work from Emily Belcetis at NYU.
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.660]   In the episode on focus, I cited a number of studies
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:06.900]   where this has actually been tested
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:08.820]   and deployed in various schools,
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:11.060]   having kids do a focus task
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:12.660]   where they look at a particular visual target
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:15.180]   for 30 to 60 seconds, then doing some mathematics
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:17.180]   and seeing pretty impressive improvement
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:18.380]   in focus and attention,
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:20.460]   even in people that have attention deficit
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.820]   hyperactivity disorder and so on.
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:26.300]   So there's no reason why you can't and shouldn't combine
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:29.500]   the sort of practical workspace optimization solutions
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:30.740]   that we talked about today
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:33.560]   with the kind of neural optimization solutions
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.540]   that we talked about in the episode on focus
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.720]   and the episode on ADHD and the episode on motivation.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.380]   By all means, layer those together.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:43.380]   That's how you're going to achieve the optimal focus bouts.
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:44.620]   That's how you're going to achieve
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:47.540]   the optimal creativity bouts.
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:48.940]   I do want to acknowledge again,
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:51.520]   the fact that I realize people are showing up
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.020]   to this challenge of workspace optimization
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.900]   with different budgets, with different constraints.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.080]   Some people have kids at homes.
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:58.500]   There are a lot of interruptions.
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:36:59.600]   Some people do not.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.380]   Nonetheless, I hope that the information
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:05.500]   I was able to provide today will allow you to make subtle
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.620]   or maybe even drastic rearrangements
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:09.200]   in your workspace environment.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.320]   There's one other point related to that
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.440]   that I did not cover and that I'd like to cover
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:16.120]   just briefly, which is that there's nothing to say
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.520]   that you have to always work
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.860]   in the same location all the time.
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:22.720]   You can move from house to cafe, if that works for you.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.400]   You can move from office to home.
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:27.360]   You can also move from different locations within your home.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.020]   I have a brief anecdote about this.
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:31.200]   I used to attend a lot of scientific meetings
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:33.560]   when a lot of scientific meetings were in person,
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.660]   and there were always a few individuals
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:36.980]   that seemed to stay engaged
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:39.180]   throughout these very long meetings.
[01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:40.780]   We're talking seven, eight-hour days,
[01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:41.980]   sometimes evening sessions,
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:44.860]   and sometimes these meetings would go on
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:47.500]   for four or five or even six days.
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.500]   These were long meetings.
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.820]   And the quality of talks varied tremendously.
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:52.560]   And I always noticed the individuals
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.920]   that managed to stay engaged and awake
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:57.380]   for the entire meeting.
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:00.520]   And I noticed that people that could maintain
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:03.720]   high levels of alertness in this one conference room
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.540]   had a habit of moving to a different seat
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:09.180]   after each session, sometimes even between talks.
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:10.540]   And I actually discussed this
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:11.860]   with one of my colleagues who was doing this.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:12.840]   I said, "Is this conscious?
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:14.700]   Are you always moving from place to place?"
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:16.420]   And they said, "Yeah, if I just stay in one place
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:18.420]   and I just look from this one particular visual angle
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:20.620]   at the screen, I find after one or two talks,
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:23.140]   regardless of how interesting the talks are,
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.680]   that I start to kind of drift.
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:26.280]   My mind isn't as engaged and indeed,
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.420]   sometimes can fall asleep."
[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:30.540]   And so I started this practice of moving from space to space
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:32.500]   or I should say seat to seat within an auditorium,
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:33.580]   and it works quite well.
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.880]   And I think it works quite well because, again,
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:38.580]   of the relationship between our visual system
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:41.300]   driving the majority of our cognition,
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.780]   our visual system drives our thinking,
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:45.920]   and that novel visual environments
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.020]   are going to lend themselves
[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.300]   to heightened levels of alertness.
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:51.540]   You don't want things to be so novel and scary
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.740]   or threatening or anxiety provoking or loud
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.740]   that they draw your attention away from your work.
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:57.620]   But I think this is part of the reason why
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:01.420]   turning on music or moving to an office or a cafe
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:03.360]   or an outdoor environment from an indoor environment
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.180]   or vice versa, maybe even within a single day,
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:08.980]   can bring about more heightened levels of productivity.
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:11.340]   I'd also like to acknowledge that what I covered today
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:14.180]   is most certainly not exhaustive
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.740]   for all the types of workspace optimization tools
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:18.300]   that one could create.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.580]   For that reason, I'd love for you to suggest
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:23.340]   any of your workspace optimization tools
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:24.480]   that you found useful.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:26.540]   Please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:27.360]   That would be the best place,
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.940]   then other people can see them.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:32.180]   Also read through those and perhaps in a future episode,
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:34.000]   I'll call about some of the ones that I've tried
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.840]   on the basis of your suggestions.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.100]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:50.860]   that you'd like us to host on the "Huberman Lab Podcast."
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:52.400]   And in general, you can ask questions.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.480]   We do eventually read all the comments
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.160]   and they do influence our future content.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:59.860]   Please also subscribe on Apple and/or Spotify.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:01.220]   And on Apple, you have the opportunity
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.540]   to leave us up to a five-star review.
[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:05.240]   Please also check out the sponsors mentioned
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:07.180]   at the beginning of this podcast episode.
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:09.520]   That's the best way to support the podcast.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.600]   We also have a Patreon.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.020]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:14.760]   And there you can support the podcast
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.480]   at any level that you like.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.760]   We also have an Instagram and a Twitter account.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.400]   It's Huberman Lab, and there I teach neuroscience
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.280]   and neuroscience-related tools.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:26.400]   Oftentimes that information and those tools overlap
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.380]   with themes on the podcast, but sometimes they are distinct
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:31.520]   from themes and topics covered on the podcast.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:34.240]   So please follow us on Instagram and Twitter.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:36.360]   This episode, we didn't talk too much about supplements,
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:39.160]   but on many previous episodes of the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.040]   we talk about supplementation.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.100]   And while supplementation isn't required
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:44.180]   or great for everybody,
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:47.640]   some people do derive tremendous benefit from supplements.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:50.160]   We talk about supplements for focus, for sleep,
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:52.620]   for creativity, all sorts of things.
[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:54.200]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.400]   you can go to Thorne,
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:59.420]   that's t-h-o-r-n-e.com/u/huberman.
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.060]   There you can see the supplements that I take.
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:03.140]   You can get 20% off those supplements.
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:05.340]   And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:06.660]   through that portal, Thorne,
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:10.300]   t-h-o-r-n-e.com/u/huberman,
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:13.140]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:14.300]   that Thorne makes.
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:15.960]   The reason we partner with Thorne
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.580]   is because one of the major issues
[01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:18.780]   in the supplement industry
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:20.620]   is that many of the supplements out there
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:23.500]   don't contain sufficient quantity,
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.680]   or they contain too much of a given supplement
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:29.000]   and the quality of the ingredients can vary tremendously.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.320]   With Thorne supplements,
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.520]   there is immense stringency
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.440]   in terms of the quality of the ingredients
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:35.820]   and the precision of the amounts of those ingredients
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:37.780]   that they include in each product.
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:40.440]   Once again, thank you for joining me for this discussion
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.600]   about the science and peer-reviewed literature
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.240]   on workspace optimization.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:46.520]   I hope some, if not all, of the tools
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.960]   will be beneficial for you.
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:50.680]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:55.840]   (upbeat music)
