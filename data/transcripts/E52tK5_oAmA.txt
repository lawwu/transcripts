[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the portion of Scripture which we read at the beginning,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   namely in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, and reading again from verse 35 to verse 39.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Verses 35 to 39 in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Again, the next day after, John stood and two of his disciples, and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   "Behold the Lamb of God." And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Then Jesus turned and saw them following, and saith unto them, "What seek ye?" They said unto him, "Rabbi,"
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   which is to say, being interpreted, "Master, where dwellest thou?" He saith unto them, "Come and see."
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Now here we come to a new section of this first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Those who attend here regularly will know that for many weeks and months we've been considering together
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   that great doctrine of the baptism with the Holy Ghost, to which we are introduced in verses 26 and 33 in particular
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   of this first chapter of this Gospel. But now we go forward to a new section.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   This first chapter of John's Gospel is, as has always been agreed and pointed out,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   one of the most amazing chapters in the whole of the Bible.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Yet it can be divided up quite simply, it seems to me, into these various sections.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   For instance, there's the prologue in the first 18 verses.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   There John makes that tremendous statement concerning the person of our blessed Lord and Savior,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   in a sense quite unique and incomparable. He suddenly presents the whole case, the whole picture,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and in doing so makes it clear that the great object and purpose behind the Incarnation
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   was that we should be made the sons of God and have the right and the authority
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   to be and to become the sons of God.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   There it is, I say, in that most amazing manner.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   You may remember, many of you, how we spent months in looking at that all-inclusive statement in the 16th verse.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Here it is. This is the essence of Christianity, of His fullness, His fullness,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   of that fullness of all we receive, and grace upon grace.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   That's Christianity. That's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Well, John there, I say, in the prologue, simply puts it all before us and says, "That's it."
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   But, of course, that's not sufficient.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   All these Gospels, in a sense, are but synopses.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   John himself tells us in chapter 20 that these are mere selections.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   He says if all the things that Jesus did and said were recorded,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   he said the world wouldn't be big enough to contain the books that would have to be written.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   We must never forget that, that we always here are confronting a kind of synopsis
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   of this amazing and extraordinary thing.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Well, but there it is in the prologue.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Then the evangelist's method, you notice and remember, is this.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Having stated it all, he now, as it were, goes back and supports this,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   or shows how evidence and testimony and witness have been born to this great
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   and tremendous comprehensive statement.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And he starts, you recall, with the witness of John the Baptist.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And John bears his witness. He is the first witness.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   He was the forerunner even, so he's naturally and inevitably the first witness.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And he makes his profound statement in his teaching, which we shall consider in a moment.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And it all leads up, as we've seen, to that great statement about the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   "And I knew him not," says John. "You're not alone in your ignorance.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I didn't fully comprehend. I didn't really know him.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   But he that sent me to baptize with water, God, said unto me,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   'Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.'"
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   That's the thing. Look to him, says John.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And so he bears his great witness to that.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And we've been considering together what that blessing of the baptism with the Holy Spirit really means.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Well now then, so far we've really been looking at the great doctrinal statement
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   which is made here in this first chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   That's quite a characteristic manner and habit with the New Testament writers.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   They suddenly burst upon us and say it all.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Then they go back and begin to take it bit by bit
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   in order that we shall see something of the component parts that go to the making up
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   of this whole, this composite, great and glorious picture.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And that's precisely what the evangelist does here.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Here is what Christianity is.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   This is the possibility.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You see it at its height as it were in the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   That's the thing that brings to us experimentally
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   the realization of what we are told here.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   In other words, no man knows much about this fullness of his with which we can be filled
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and of which we receive grace upon grace apart from the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   You can be a Christian, yes, and you can see something of its glory
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   but the only people who know anything about his fullness
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   are those, as we've seen, who are baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And this should therefore be the great and the grand objective
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   in front of every Christian believer.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I again would put it to you in this manner.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   The first question that anyone claiming to be a Christian must ask himself or herself is this.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Have I received of his fullness?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And am I receiving grace upon grace?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   That is essential Christianity.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Therefore we start by asking that question.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And then we can go on and put it like this.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   If we are in trouble about that question
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   or if we are doubtful whether we know much about that fullness
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   or if looking at the possibilities
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and the results of the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   we say, "Well, I can't say that I am there.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I can't say I've got that, but that's what I'd like.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   That's what I desire. How can I get there?"
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Well now, I want to try to put it to you that in what follows now
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   the apostle comes down to our level at that point
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   and begins to show us and to tell us something, it in or it of,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   the way in which this does become a practical possibility
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   in the life of every one of us.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   That's the point of transition I suggest here at the beginning of the 35th verse.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   All so far has been statement of the doctrine, the possibility.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   This is what he's come to do and to bring and to make possible.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Now then, all right, there it is, there's the mountain top.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   But we are down here, we are down in the plains
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and often in the bogs and troubled.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   What's the use of talking to us about that mountain top?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Is it possible for anybody from down here to get up there?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Well, it is.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And the whole point of the gospel in a sense is to tell us how that can happen.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And of course, it's a part of the purpose of the teaching of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Again, you see it historically in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   You then go back to the epistles and you get the final exposition of it all.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   That's what makes this New Testament such an amazing book.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   One great central theme put before us in differing ways.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Well, now then, let's see how the evangelist puts all this before us here.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   He does it like this.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Having painted the great picture,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   he says, now then, how did this actually come into practice?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   How did all that possibility lead to the Christian church?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And his answer is, listen, he says, I'll give you some examples and illustrations.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And in the remainder of this chapter, from verse 35 to the last verse, verse 51,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I suggest to you that you've got five pictures, which I trust, God willing,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   we can consider together beginning this morning and continue during the next four Sundays.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Here are practical pictures showing us, men and women, like passions, with ourselves,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   ordinary people, fishermen, and others,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   showing us how eventually these men became apostles,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   became filled with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and proceeded to do some of the extraordinary things recorded in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   That's precisely what he does here.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Now, this is history, and that's the glory, again, of the New Testament in its teaching.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   You not only get these great, objective, didactic statements,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   but you get the practical illustrations.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And the essence of understanding the Christian life and the essence of preaching
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   is to keep these two things always together.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   It's not something far and remote, it's something essentially practical.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   He came in order that we might receive of his fullness, and grace upon grace.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Very well, I say it is history, but at the same time it is teaching.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And I hope to be able to show you in these five illustrations here
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   the great principles that govern this matter always.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Now, the principles are always the same.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   You find them here in this form.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Here it's in a sense prophetic, it's looking forward to what is going to happen.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   But it's exactly the same that you find being worked out in the book of Acts,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   and the same that is expounded in the various epistles of the New Testament.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And I want to hold before you some of these great principles that have taught us here.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And this morning we look at this first picture.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   John the Baptist is again standing.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And this time he's accompanied by two of his disciples.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And they stand there, and as they do so, they see the Lord Jesus Christ walking away from them.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And John, looking at him as he walked, said, "Behold the Lamb of God."
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Now, we are told that one of these two disciples was a man called Andrew,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   and the other, it's generally agreed, was none other than John himself who wrote this gospel.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   John's characteristic as a writer is he always keeps his name out.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   He doesn't mention himself.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   He keeps himself, as it were, in the background.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   He often refers to himself as that disciple whom Jesus loved.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   He doesn't parade his name.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   He keeps it back, out of sight.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   But it's generally agreed that this other disciple was John the Evangelist.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Now, these two men were disciples of John the Baptist.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   They were obviously men who were concerned about their souls and about their religious life.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And when this extraordinary phenomenon of John the Baptist burst upon the scene,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   when they heard, as everybody began to hear, that there was this extraordinary man out in the wilderness,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   clad with a camel hair shirt and a leather girdle, who ate nothing but locusts and wild honey,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   and who preached in a most prophetic and extraordinary manner,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   such as had not been heard for 400 years since the days of Malachi,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   they went out and they listened to him and they became his disciples.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And here they are, standing with him, two of them,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   and they hear what he says as he sees Jesus of Nazareth walking away from them.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Now, all I'm going to show you is this.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   How does one pass from being a disciple and a follower and a student of John the Baptist
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   to become an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   That's the question.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Or, if you like, how does one move from this position of being a man who is concerned and who has repented,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   how does one pass from that to receiving of his fullness, to being baptized with the Holy Ghost,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   and attaining unto the stature of the Christian men as he is portrayed and delineated in the various New Testament epistles?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And all I'm going to do this morning is to take you through the simple steps that are put before us here.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And I do want to emphasize that word "simple."
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It is we who always make the complications.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   The thing itself is essentially simple.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   We talk about these things, we read books, men write books,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   and the whole thing seems so complex and difficult and complicated.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   In reality, it isn't.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And that's why we should thank God for these cameos, these pictures that we have here and there in these gospels in particular.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   And here is one this morning.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   These two men, look at them.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   What are the steps?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   What does one have to do in order to get from John to Jesus,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   from baptism with water to baptism with the Holy Ghost,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   from emptiness to fullness?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Well, now, here are the simple steps.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   The first is this.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   We must accept the teaching and the testimony of John the Baptist.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Now, that is an absence.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   There's no discussion here.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   This is basic.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   This is quite fundamental.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   John the Baptist, as I said just now, is the forerunner.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And he always points to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   That's his great message.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Indeed, you can sum up the message of John the Baptist in the one word that he kept on using.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   It's this word, "Behold."
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   John is a kind of finger post.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   He's a pointer.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   He says, "Behold, I'm nothing, I'm nobody.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I indeed baptize with water.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   But he shall baptize with the Holy Ghost.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   I am not worthy to undo the lecher to his shoe.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   He must increase, I must decrease."
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   That's John.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   John's message, I say, is summarized in this one word, "Look."
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   "Behold, there he is."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   John's always pointing away from himself to this other.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   And I say there is no hope whatsoever.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Unless we pay great heed to the teaching and the instruction of John the Baptist.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I've got to pause with this because we're not only aware in our own experiences, many of us,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   but anybody who has any knowledge whatsoever of the history of the church
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   and who's ever read any of the biographies of the people of God throughout the running centuries
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   will know the importance of all this.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   The moment you become concerned about this fullness, this life with God,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   you will find that there are many plausible teachings which offer themselves to you.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Take the whole question of mysticism.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It's designed to do this very thing.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   There are many aberrations from the Christian faith, various things that have become cults.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   They do exactly the same thing.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   They're all out to bring you to this position.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   But that's why this is so basic.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Very often you will find that the various forms of mystical teaching
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   bypass the teaching of John the Baptist altogether.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   They're not interested in it.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   They're not concerned about it.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   They've got a shortcut.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   But the New Testament makes this quite foundational.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And apart from this there is nothing at all.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   We must start with John the Baptist.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   He's the forerunner.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   He's the pointer.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   He's the indicator.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And he all along keeps on saying this, "Behold!"
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   And why does he do that?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Why does he point to him?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Well, he's summarized his teaching in the 34th verse.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   He's addressing his company here, and he says,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   "I saw and bear record that this is the Son of God."
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Here it is.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Everything points to this person.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   There is nothing apart from him.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   There is no true knowledge of God apart from this person.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Christianity is an exclusive gospel.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   It not only admits no rival, it admits no assistants.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   It doesn't need any.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   "In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Our faith is an exclusive faith.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And we assert that a man is either a Christian or he's not a Christian.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   I'm putting it like that because of what again is gaining a great deal of currency at the present time.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I was reading a statement by a man very popular in ecumenical circles the other day
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   in which he says, "You mustn't say of anybody that he's not a Christian.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   There's no such thing as a non-Christian."
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Thus you see the gospel and the teaching of John the Baptist are being denied at the present time.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Oh yes, you are either Christian or non-Christian.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Any attempt to claim that you have a knowledge of God apart from this person is a lie.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   It's not the truth.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Didn't our Lord himself say, "John keeps on putting it before us."
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   "By them the way and the truth and the life, no man cometh to the Father, but by me."
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Why did John ever write his gospel?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Why does he burst out like this in the prologue?
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   The point is he's saying this is the only way.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And therefore you've got to start with this.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   So he produces this witness testimony of John the Baptist at the very beginning.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   And he says, "Listen, behold, look, there he is.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Who is he? Son of God."
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Now I mustn't keep you with this this morning.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   We've already been considering all that really in the prologue.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   I'm just summarizing the teaching of this gospel up to this point.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   But there it is, my friends.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   You either believe that he is the only begotten Son of God or you don't.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   The great question still is what think ye of Christ?
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Who is this Jesus?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Is he only a man?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Is he just the greatest religious teacher?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Is he just the greatest mystic of all times?
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Is he just the one who went further than anybody else before or after him
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   in this appreciation of the life of God?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   What is he?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Is he Son of God?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Is the incarnation true or isn't it?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   And the testimony of John the Baptist is that he is the Son of God.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   We beheld his glory.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   The glory is of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   My dear friend, if you are in any trouble about the person of Christ,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   don't seek any mystical experience.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Don't seek any knowledge of God.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   You can't get it.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   It's all in him and in him alone.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   "It pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   It is in him that God has treasured and has stored
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   all the riches of his grace and of his knowledge.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   I saw and bear record that this is the Son of God."
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Very well.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   The second great strand in John's teaching, you remember,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   is the thing that is repeated twice over in this first chapter.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   You have it in verse 29 and you have it again in this 36th verse.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Verse 29, "The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   'Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.'"
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   He repeats it.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   "Behold the Lamb of God."
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   What a phrase.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   What a pregnant statement.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   The Lamb of God.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   What's it mean?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Oh, this is God's own Lamb.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Salvation is not by the lambs of the burnt offerings of the Old Testament,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   not the lamb that was slain and offered morning and evening
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   in the tabernacle and then in the temple.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   No, no, these are all shadows.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   These are all adambrosions.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   These are all foreshadowings.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   But God has provided his own Lamb and his Lamb is his own Son.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   The Son of God is the Lamb.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And here, of course, is the great doctrine of the atonement
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   that our sins were laid upon this innocent Lamb.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   The high priest puts his hands upon the head of the offering,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   metaphorically transferring sins to him, and the Lamb is slain.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   And his blood is the blood of the atonement that is presented to God.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Atonement is essential and he is our substitute.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   By his stripes we are healed.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   By whose stripes we are healed.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Lamb of God.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Oh, the fulfillment of Isaiah 53,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   led as a lamb to the slaughter.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Here it is.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   There is no knowledge of God,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   there is no receiving of that eternal fullness,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   except we go via the atonement, via Calvary, via the cross,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   via the death, burial, resurrection,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   via the offering of the blood of the Son of God
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   before the heavenly and eternal altar.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   This, according to the evangelists, is an absolute essential.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   So I put it again like this.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   There are many people who are troubled about their Christian life
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   and about their spiritual experience.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   They say, "I want this, I'd give anything."
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   But I find in talking to them so often
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   that what they really need is a little instruction
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   about the way of salvation.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   They have never seen that the Son of God had to die,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   not imputing their trespasses unto them
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   because he'd imputed them to him.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   My friend, have you listened to John the Baptist?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Son of God, Lamb of God.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Do you know your sins were laid upon him
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and that you are forgiven solely because he received your punishment?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   That's basic.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   John has indicated this as he points to him saying,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   "Behold the Lamb of God."
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And then the third strand or element in his teaching
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   was of course the one with which we've been dealing at such length,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   I say nothing about that this morning.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   We've dealt with it, I believe, in an exhaustive manner.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Let me sum up the teaching of John the Baptist then by putting it like this.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   "Look," says John, "listen.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I'm the end of an era. He's the beginning of an era.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   I'm the last of the line of prophets.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   He is the bringer in of the new and the heavenly
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   and the everlasting and the eternal."
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   "Now," says John, "the time has come. I've finished. He's beginning.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Look at him. There he is. Behold the Lamb of God."
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Now all I'm saying this morning is that this is the very first step.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   This is the absolute foundation.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   This is the irreducible minimum.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I'm not interested in a man who doesn't believe in Jesus as the Son of God.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   He's not a Christian. He can't be.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   It's a denial of the term, a denial of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Likewise, a man who doesn't realize that he is forgiven
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   because the Lamb of God was slain is not a Christian.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   He's a Pharisee.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And likewise, I say that it is essential that a man realizes
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   that apart from this baptism with the Holy Ghost,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   he will never know the thrill and the abandon
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and the loyalty and the rejoicing with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Christ came to baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   And there John summarizes it all up and says, "There he is."
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Now then, what happens?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Here are the simple steps that follow.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   What we are told about these men is this,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Why did they do that?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Well, the answer is, of course, because they believed what John the Baptist was saying.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   It really comes to that.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   They said to themselves, "If what our teacher is saying is true,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   we leave him and we go after this other.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   This is the one, therefore."
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   And he's been talking about a baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   That's the thing we stand in need of, so we'll go after him.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And I would put this as a principle this morning in this form,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   that the first thing we all have to learn in respect to this great matter
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   is as simple as this, that you apply to him himself.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   The point comes when you leave the teachers, the instructors, the guides, the signposts,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   and you go after him.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   You apply to him himself.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Is this point of transition clear, my friends?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   To me, it's one of the most important things a man ever discovers in the Christian life.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   You can spend a lifetime without realizing it with the teachers,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   without any direct dealings with him.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   You can spend your lifetime reading your Bible, even,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   reading good books, books of devotion,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   listening to sermons, addresses, lectures,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   but you've never gone after him.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   You've never gone to him himself.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   You've stayed with the teachers.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   You've had the indirect knowledge always.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   You've been living, perhaps, on the faith of your forefathers.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   You've been living on a tradition.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   All you believe is absolutely right,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   but you've stayed there and you've never gone to him himself.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   These two men, they have the wisdom to see it.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   They leave John, they walk after him.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And this, I say, is a very vital step,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   that realizing what John the Baptist says is true
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   and realizing something of the possibilities of grace,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   we feel we want it and we are determined to get it,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   so we leave our teachers and we go to him himself,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   seeking Jesus himself directly.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Now then, let me encourage you to do so,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   and I do it in this way.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   A wonderful story we are looking at this morning.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Do you know what's going to happen to you if you do what I'm saying?
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   If you really have seen this and have listened to the message of John the Baptist
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   and have accepted it and believed it and the desire is there kindling within you
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   to know of this blessed fullness and to receive of it,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   and you're leaving him and you're going after Jesus,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   you're seeking him himself directly,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   do you know what's going to happen to you?
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Listen to this, here's the first thing.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   "Then Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them, 'What seek ye?'"
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   You see, this is what happened.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   At this point, the Lord Jesus Christ was walking away from them.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   They were looking at his back.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   On the previous occasion, Jesus was coming to them.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   This time, he's walking away from them,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and there he is with his back to them, and John says to these two men,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   "Behold the Lamb of God!"
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And they went after him.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   "And he suddenly turned round and looked upon them."
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Now, this, I say, is history.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Yes, but it isn't only history.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   This is teaching.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   This is what he still does.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   This is all that is true of him.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   What he was, he is and always will be.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   He cannot change, and as he dealt with these two,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   he deals with anybody this morning who has accepted the testimony of John the Baptist
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   and has gone after him.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   "Go after him," I say, "this is what you'll find.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   He'll turn round and he'll greet you."
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   What does that mean?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Well, this is the glory of it and the comfort of it.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   He knows all about you.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   He knows that you're walking after him.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   He knows the desire of your heart.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   He knows exactly what you're thinking.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   He's got his back turned to you.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Does it make any difference?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   He's omniscient. He sees everything.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   He knows all.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Is there anything under him this morning that is so wonderful and exhilarating as this thought
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   that you and I, humble nonentities as we are in this world, are known to him?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   And the moment you start taking steps in his direction,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   he knows and he turns round and he welcomes you.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   If this were not true,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   there'd be no point in preaching.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   The business of preaching is to tell men and women this.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   He knows all, yes, but still more important, you see, is this.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   He turns round to encourage them, to welcome them,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   to show his loving interest in them.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   This is what we are told about him, you see,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   and this is what makes him the saviour, the blessed saviour that he is.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   We are told of him, "The bruised reed he will not break,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   and the smoking flecks he will not quench."
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   You see, we tend to think he's only interested in some great conflagration,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   some shining saint there on the top of the mountain,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   that he's not interested, but he is.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   He doesn't quench the smoking flecks.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   To the eye of mortal men, there's nothing there at all.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   But he sees the little flicker, the smoke coming out of this fleck.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   What the world ignores, he is aware of and he is pleased with it.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   He doesn't bruise the broken reed and the smoking flecks, he will not quench.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   But he encourages it.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   He's out to fend it into a flame.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   He likes any spark, any indication, and the moment you show it,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   he'll turn, he'll respond, he'll encourage you,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   he'll come with all his love and mercy and compassion.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   John James, in his epistle, has exactly the same thought.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   He puts it in these words.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   And if there is anybody discouraged in this congregation this morning, listen to this.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   "Draw nigh unto God, and he will draw nigh unto you."
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   You go after Christ, he'll turn round and he'll come to meet you.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   He'll welcome you, he'll smile upon you, he'll receive you.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   "Draw nigh unto God, and he will draw nigh unto you."
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   It's the most amazing and astounding thing a man can ever be told.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   If there is but the glimmer of a desire in your heart this morning,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   for this fullness and this knowledge of God, go after him, go to him, my friend,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   and he'll turn round and he'll welcome you.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   But, wait a minute, he'll put a question to you.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   "Jesus turned and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye?"
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Now, you notice he doesn't say, "Who seek ye?"
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   He says, "What seek ye?"
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   And again, this is very vital and essential teaching.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   He does welcome you, and he does thus receive you and encourage you,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   but at the same time he makes it perfectly plain and clear
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   that it's got to happen in his way and in his way only.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   And the first thing he's always concerned about is our motive.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Why are we going after him?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   He turns to receive these two men and says, "What are you after?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   What are you seeking? What's your motive? Why are you following me?"
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   He does this because he knows us so well and because he knows
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   that it cannot be taken for granted always
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   that our motives in following him are always good and are always true.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   You see, here was a new movement and here was a new teacher,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   and he knew mankind.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   People are very ready to leave the old and to go to the new.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   They'd heard John the Baptist. "Who's this?"
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Off they go, curiosity, excitement, like the people at Athens,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   always hoping to hear or to find some new thing.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And they're like that in London, the latest craze.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Off they go in every realm and department of life, the novel, the new.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Off they rush. Our Lord knows that, so he puts a searching question,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   "What are you after?"
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   And then he knows how people are always interested in something
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   that makes a great promise or gives a great offer,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   excitement and thrill, experiences.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   I've been going into that in dealing with the doctrine of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Here it is again. Our Lord puts it in a question, "What do you want?
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Are you just out for thrills and experiences and excitements?
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Are you just out to have certain powers?
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Are you just out perhaps for physical healing?
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   What do you want? What are you really interested in?
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Is it me or something you can get from me?"
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Oh, this is this extraordinary combination of tenderness and truth,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   goodness and severity.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   It's essential. It's a part of the warp and woof
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   of the whole teaching of the New Testament.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   He'll search you. Yes, he's loving, but remember he's the Lord,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   and he'll search you through and through.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   He wants you to be pure. He wants you to be whole.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   He wants you to seek him for what he is and not for what he gives.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   He wants you to be clear that you are honest in your motives and in your desires,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   that you're more concerned about his glory than you are about yourself
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   and the position you are going to hold.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   You see, we are all very carnal, and he knows that men go after him
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   for their own good and their own benefit, even in the state of the church today.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   There are people who are interested in Christianity
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   because it's a social outlet for them
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   or because it gives them room to exercise certain activities and gifts that they've got.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Oh, the motives that have brought people into the Christian church
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   throughout the centuries. How appalling!
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   It's not surprising that he asks, "What are you seeking?
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   What are you after? What do you want?
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Are you out for your own glory in any shape or form?
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   If you are, go back!"
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   No man receives of his fullness until he's empty.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   This is the question that empties us of all self, all vain glory,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   all unhealthy, unworthy ambitions connected with him.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   What's seeking?
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Examine yourselves.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Make certain that you really want me.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   He invariably puts this question.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Welcome, yes, but it's in his way and in his terms.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   And at this point there is only one right answer to give to him.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   It was the answer that was given by John and by Andrew.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   "What seek ye?" says the Lord.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   They said unto him, "Rabbi, Master, where dwellest thou?"
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   What's that mean?
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Is this just an idle curiosity on their part,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   wanting to know where he lived, where he stayed?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Of course it isn't.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   This is a tremendous statement.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   They're confessing their faith here.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   This is their way of saying this.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   "Master, we are not animated by idle curiosity.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   We are not following after you in order that we can go back home
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   and say, 'Yes, we followed him, and he turned round,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   and we had a word with him.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   Wasn't it wonderful? Wasn't it amazing?'
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And we become the center of interest in the town.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   We're not like that. That's not it.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Master," they said, "Look here, where do you stay?
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Where are you spending your time?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   A casual conversation on the road isn't enough.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   We want to come and listen to you.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   We want to sit at your feet.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   We want you to be our master.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Can we come? Can we sit at your feet?
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Are you ready to receive us?"
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   That's the content of that statement, and nothing less.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   They want to spend time with him.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   They want to listen to him.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   They want to know more about this.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   And that can't be done in a casual encounter.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   No, no, it takes time.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   "Oh, I haven't got time to work this out this morning.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   We may have occasion to do so again,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   but here it is, my friend, in a principle."
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Do you want to spend time with him?
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Are you ready to make time in order that you may be with him?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Do you ever forget everybody and everything
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   in order to spend time with him?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Do you say to him, "Where dwellest thou?
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Can I come and be with you?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Can I spend the rest of the day with you?"
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   We are told here that they did, you see.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   They went with him, and they abode with him.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   It was about the tenth hour.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   They spent a long time with him,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   and there they stayed the night.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   And this was their desire.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   They're saying, "I want you, and I want to listen to you.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   I want to hear what you've got to say.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   I don't care how long."
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   We must become like Mary, you see, not like Martha.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Martha was very glad to have him in the house.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   She could boast that she'd entertained him,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   tell all the friends she'd become important.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   And there she is fussing about back and forth
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   from kitchen to drawing room.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Now, now, Mary sits at his feet and drinks it in.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   "Oh, do we know anything about this?
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Have we ever offered this prayer?
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Oh, that I could forever sit like Mary at the Master's feet.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Be this my happy choice, my only care, delight and bliss,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   my joy, my heaven on earth.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Be this to hear the Master's voice.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Where dwellest thou?
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Oh, that I could forever sit like Mary at the Master's feet."
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   This is the only answer that is acceptable at this point.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   That you haven't got just a sudden impulse,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   and you want, and then forget all about it,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   and then take up something else, or do it in spasms.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   "No, no." You say, "We want to be with you.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Where are you? Where you stay?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   We are coming with you.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   We are your disciples henceforward.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   We want nothing but to listen to you."
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   That's it. That's the next step.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   And then, if you say that to him,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   he will invariably say this to you.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   "Come and see."
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Now he is satisfied with them.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   He knows their motives are clear and are right,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   and that they are animated by the right desire,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   and that they really want him.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   So he says, "Come, come and see. Come with me.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And here there are no conditions.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   You've passed the test.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   And come along," he says, "I'll begin to tell you about it."
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Thus, you see, in this dramatic and historical form,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   we find the profoundest teaching about how to know him
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   and how to be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   We are able to say,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   "With the psalmist, yes, when I seek him,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   when the Lord becomes my shepherd,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   he maketh me to lie down in the green pastures.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   He leadeth me beside the still waters.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   He restoreth my soul.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Once I say to him, 'You are my shepherd.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Where dwellest thou?
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   You are to be my leader and my teacher.'
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   He says, 'Come and see.'
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   And he leads us on."
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   So that we are able to say, "With Philip Doddridge,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   he drew me,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   and I followed on,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   charmed to confess that voice divine."
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Very well, and then you see the result ends in this.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   "They came, they saw where he dwelt,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   and the bird will him for that day."
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Reminiscent of the words, "They came, they saw, they conquered."
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Well, it isn't exactly that, but it's like it, isn't it?
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   He says, "Come and see."
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   And you'll go with him.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   And you'll find that he's ready to speak to you.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   He's patient, he's tender, he's long-suffering,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   he's ready to answer your questions,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   to resolve your difficulties.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   "They came, and they saw where he dwelt,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   and they a bird with him that day."
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   "It's all right," he said, "you needn't be troubled,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   I'll look after you.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   Stay the night with me.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   It's all right.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   You're just the kind of people I'm looking for that I want,
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   and I'll give myself to you.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   And you shall receive of my fullness,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   and grace upon grace."
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Well, there, my dear friends, is the first picture,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   this practical picture.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   "There you are," I say, "down on the dull plains of life,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   and you've been hearing about something extraordinary
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   that is to be seen from the top of that mountain.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   It seems hopeless."
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   It doesn't.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   You take these first steps.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   And you'll find that he'll turn to you,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   and smile upon you,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   and having made certain of your real heart's desire,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   he will say to you as he said to these men of old,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   "Come and see."
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   And you will see, and you'll go on seeing
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   for the rest of your life.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Amen.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   The closing hymn is hymn number 373, 373.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   "Oh, happy day that fixed my choice
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   on thee my Saviour and my God."
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   373.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   [organ music]
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   "Oh, happy day that fixed my choice
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   on thee my Saviour and my God.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   When faith is broken, love is found,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   and every man is found.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Oh, happy day that fixed my choice
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   on thee my Saviour and my God.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   When faith is broken, love is found,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   and every man is found.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   When faith is broken, love is found,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   and every man is found.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   When faith is broken, love is found,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   and every man is found.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   The Lord has died on the isle of Bethlehem,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   with all his faithful candlelight.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   We are the children of God's true love,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   when God's holy angels pray for thee.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   I am the blood of the true love of God,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   and I will use thy name in faith.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   In thy name is all my love,
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   and let it bear my cross again."
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   "And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   and to present us faultless,

[00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   To the only wise God our Saviour be glory and majesty,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   dominion and power both now and ever.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   and the love of God,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   abide and continue with us now
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   earthly life and pilgrimage,
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   and until we shall see him as he is
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   and be forever with the Lord.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Amen."
