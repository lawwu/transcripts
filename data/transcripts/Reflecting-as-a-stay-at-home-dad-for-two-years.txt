[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and happy Good Friday 2019.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.600]   This podcast is about reflection.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.720]   I want to reflect on two years of being a stay-at-home dad.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.880]   There aren't many stay-at-home dads and I don't think a lot of them would voice their
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.120]   thoughts and feelings over these past two years either.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.320]   I thought it'd be good to do something a little bit different.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.740]   I still remember the day my son was born like it was yesterday.
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.840]   After only about an hour of labor, he joined us in this world at 11.58 p.m.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.240]   So he just squeaked on by.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.800]   It was the greatest moment of both of our lives.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.860]   Nothing comes close.
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.920]   Not a job, raise or promotion, not getting into your top choice university, nothing.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.000]   And this is something that you just have to experience for yourself.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.200]   There's no amount of pontification or imagining to think how that moment will feel.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.240]   And so from that time forward when he came into the world, we pledged to care for him
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.800]   as best as we could.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.280]   And in a very big way, all the years of saving and investing were to prepare for this moment
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.100]   that we could both be stay-at-home parents.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.080]   As first-time parents, we didn't know what to expect.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.780]   I read maybe six books on parenting.
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.320]   My wife read probably even more and I still have three books on parenting right on my
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.180]   bedside table.
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.320]   We figured having both of us care for our boy would be the optimal way to go for his
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.800]   sake and for his safety.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.680]   So here are my personal reflections as a stay-at-home dad for the past two years.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.240]   I've sent this post and this podcast to his email account for him to read when he's a
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.240]   little bit older.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.480]   I think this is a pretty good trick to just set up something, his name or her name at
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.400]   whatever gmail.com or whatever account you want to use and just randomly send some updates
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.600]   and reflections.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.680]   I have a podcast and a personal finance site so I can regularly update him this way, but
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.880]   the email version is a little bit more personal.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.440]   So here are some thoughts.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.240]   And I'll start off with some personal finance thoughts because after all, this is Financial
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.320]   Samurai.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.840]   So one, it is hard to lose so much money, but losing time is much harder.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.480]   Due to being a stay-at-home dad for two years, I've lost out on probably over $400,000 in
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.920]   income with 18 to 20 years of experience in finance and online media.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.880]   It's relatively straightforward and easy to get a $200,000 to $250,000 job here in the
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.120]   Bay Area plus restrict the stock units.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.120]   If I were to go back to banking, my base salary would be $250,000 plus bonus.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.920]   Although losing out on so much income is hard given we now have more expenses to take care
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.800]   of our son, I wouldn't miss out on the first two years of my son's life for probably any
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   amount.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   I was thinking about it.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.440]   If you give me a billion dollars, but in order to get that billion dollars, I'd have to be
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.640]   away from home and be away from him for 14 hours to make that money.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.440]   I'd probably decline.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.440]   I really would.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.520]   I've spent some time with some billionaires before and maybe they're just putting on airs
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.280]   and being respectful, but they seem quite like you and me.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.840]   They've got the same issues, same problems, same health, bum, knee.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.440]   The only difference is they have big mansions and they get a lot of adoration and publicity,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.120]   which I actually don't like.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.600]   They get to fly private everywhere, including to my favorite islands, Hawaii, where that
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   jet costs like $10,000 to $20,000 an hour to get there and it takes five to five and
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.640]   a half hours to get to Hawaii.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.200]   That's the only perk I would think being a billionaire would give you.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.880]   I know I would have regretted pursuing more money over more time with my son and that's
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.160]   probably because we have enough.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.440]   Now we don't have massive amounts of money, but we have enough.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:54.040]   We have enough to live in a cozy home, to drive a car, to eat food and to pay for transportation
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   and save for college and grade school.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.120]   I think that guilt would have consumed me if I went back to work.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.240]   I would have seen more money in my bank account, but I would start asking myself, "What's it
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   for?
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.440]   What's it all for?" if it's not a means to an end to spend more time with family.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.520]   I've gotten to know a couple of nannies over the years and they have told me how they won't
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:24.080]   tell the parents about new milestones so that the parents can think they're first time witnesses.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.720]   And I thought that was really thoughtful, but at the same time, a little bit sad.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.760]   At the end of the day, I knew I could always make more money, but I could never create
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.080]   more time with our son.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.880]   So that post I wrote in the past called "Career or Family, You Only Have to 'Sacrifice' for
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.120]   at most five years" is really relevant.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.440]   Two years and then maybe three years, they'll go to preschool and then you can get more
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.560]   of your time back and you can go spend time working if you want.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.440]   But I think it's so important, at least for me, to spend those first two years at home.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.360]   Second reflection, being a stay-at-home parent is the hardest job in the world without a
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.620]   doubt.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.080]   For all the stay-at-home parents out there, I salute you.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.920]   And for all the single parents out there, you have my deepest, deepest admiration for
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.320]   trying to make it all work.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   Man, it is so hard.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.560]   Because I think about working in equities and banking 14 hours a day, where there's
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.360]   constant pressure to perform and to rank well with your clients and to bring in business.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.080]   I think it's kind of like a walk in the park compared to full-time fatherhood.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.120]   With full-time fatherhood, you're on 24/7 due to the risk of injury or death by the
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.240]   child.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.520]   The first year of life is so fragile, which is why you're always on high alert for choking,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.720]   suffocation, tumbles, running into a sharp corner and so forth.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.280]   Oh my gosh, we spend lots of money and so many hours patting on the corners, patting
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.000]   the walls and everything around our house.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.120]   Because no matter what, our son would find those danger zones.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.560]   And I kept reading stories about sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS, which are also so incredibly
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.560]   heartbreaking.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.600]   A baby would just die for no reason or would just suffocate in a crib.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.760]   And the mom or the dad would wake up and find the baby just motionless.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   And I just couldn't get these images and these stories out of my head.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.600]   So the first year, man, I was full of paranoia.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.400]   I wouldn't be able to sleep uninterrupted for more than three to four hours.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.800]   And for SIDS and for sleeping, the latest research is back is best and get rid of all
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   blankets and all pillows in the crib because you don't want your little one to suffocate.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   Once your child starts to verbalize his or her desires, it's all about repetition.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.200]   And so if you don't have patience, repetition can get really grating sometimes.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.920]   So for example, my son loves garage doors and will say garage door, double wide garage
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:08.360]   door, quadruple wide, big brown garage door with horizontal lines over and over again.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.360]   And it's cute.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.360]   It's very cute.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.660]   But, you know, after the hundredth iteration, it kind of gets, hmm, let's let's talk about
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.660]   something else.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.660]   Right.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.480]   So you've got to be really patient, patient, patient, patient.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.320]   And you've got to repeat the words and interact.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.920]   Otherwise, your little one will know you're not paying attention.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.000]   My little boy certainly does know.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.680]   I've also heard whines, screams and crying maybe three to six times a day for seven hundred
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.680]   thirty days in a row.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.320]   You know, in the beginning, it's just it was kind of shocking.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.320]   Right.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.440]   Because in our household, my wife and I, we hardly ever fight.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.080]   We don't scream, definitely.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.380]   And we don't cry like that.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.880]   So it was an adjustment period.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.440]   And our boy is a top one percent chatterbox.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.300]   He's so determined.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.280]   And so it's wonderful that he talks a lot.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.960]   And it's wonderful that he's so determined.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.320]   But these are also adjustments to make.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.120]   And again, it takes a lot of patience.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.760]   And over time, things are getting better as he's being able to more verbally communicate
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.440]   his needs and wants.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.440]   And here's the kicker.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.400]   Even though my wife spent about I would say she was 70 percent.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:23.520]   She did 70 percent of the caretaking due to the nursing needs, most of all, and also nighttime.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.320]   I still felt like being a stay at home dad was the hardest thing I've ever done.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.520]   So one must develop that preparation and knowledge and patience before diving in, because it's
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.240]   a lot of work, folks.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.500]   Third point and back to money again.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.560]   Have children and the money will come.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.840]   I've heard the saying before, and I really didn't realize how true it was until our son
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.160]   was born.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.400]   Although both my wife and I gave up healthy salaries to raise our boy full time, we were
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.600]   somehow able to make more money each year after he was born.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.760]   Now, how is this possible?
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.160]   Well, what happens is when you have a child, your mind and body go into overdrive to try
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.040]   and provide as much care and support as possible.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.200]   As a result, you gain even more energy to find ways to financially support your family.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   It's kind of like adrenaline or you hear stories about someone picking up a car to save a life
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.400]   or something.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.960]   It's like next level aftermarket boosters that just really pump you up.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.560]   In my case, I had been waking up at around 5.30 to 6.15 a.m. to start the day for a couple
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.880]   hours before my wife would wake up to write on Financial Samurai.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.920]   So after our son was born, I started waking up between 3.30 a.m. and 4.30 a.m. to get
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.840]   work done before he would wake up at 6.30, 7 a.m.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:49.080]   So I didn't quit and I just kept on going because I just told myself my family depended
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.520]   on me and I knew my family depended on me.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.080]   I needed to work in order to continue to generate some stable income along with the passive
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:02.440]   income because I have this paranoia that we're going to run out one day or something bad
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.960]   is going to happen one day because bad things happen all the time.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.960]   I just didn't want to quit.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.880]   I just wanted to keep on going.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.520]   So that was something really interesting that I found.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.720]   The days were very long.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:21.600]   We're talking on average 4 a.m. to 10 p.m. with at least a 45-minute nap in between.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.960]   Next four, it's easy to gain weight and get sick.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.760]   This is something that's probably will be new to a lot of parents as well because as
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.360]   adults we probably only get sick like once a year maybe because when all you're doing
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.120]   is caring for your baby at home, it's easy to gain weight.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:43.560]   I went from 168 pounds at 5'10" to 173 pounds even though I was consciously trying not to
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.000]   overeat.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.880]   But after about the 18th month, I started losing weight and I got back to about 166
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.720]   to 169.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.840]   The main reason why is because our boy likes to take hour plus long walks around our hilly
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   hills.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.640]   There's this one time, hour 20-minute walk.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.200]   It was an awesome beautiful day.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.920]   Down the hill, up the hill and then let's have some lunch and fingers crossed, let's
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.520]   time to take an hour to two-hour nap.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.840]   Nope, he just kept on going right to 8 p.m.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.040]   So that takes a lot of energy.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.920]   In terms of sickness, first year he didn't get sick and then on the 12th month, he got
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.160]   a little bit sick.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.740]   And then after that, as we started going more and more into public settings, every quarter
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:34.600]   he would get sick, runny nose or something and then that vomiting virus came after we
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.240]   visited a preschool the very next day and that sickness spread to us.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.240]   So we're always fighting some kind of cold.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.320]   So that's something we got to be aware of.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:49.080]   So for folks who are planning to have a baby, for men, try to lose 5 or 10 pounds before
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.280]   to give yourself a buffer after.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.960]   Fifth takeaway and I think this is really going to disappoint and surprise a lot of
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.240]   folks.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.400]   Nannies are not paying attention.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.200]   I'm really sad to report this but after spending over 150 sessions in a public setting, whether
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.640]   it's at a park or a museum or a playground, the vast majority of nannies, I would say
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:14.800]   90 plus percent, are on their phones the entire one hour they're there.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.200]   We're addicted to our phones.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.280]   We've got this epidemic going on.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:24.960]   And so if you think about it, if you can get paid that hour while having fun and doing
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.520]   whatever on your phone, that's the natural tendency.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.640]   Every time I play chase with my boy, every time, there will inevitably be 2 or 3 other
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.200]   kids who will start playing along and playing chase because their nannies are not paying
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.540]   attention to them.
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:45.120]   And I've seen countless falls by 10 month old to 18 months old just learning to walk
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.440]   because their nannies are not paying attention.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.480]   And I often wonder actually whether one of the reasons for slow speech development is
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.200]   because the nanny simply does not spend enough time speaking to their child or describing
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.800]   things to the child as they happen.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.960]   We parents should be verbally describing everything to our children on an ongoing basis.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.720]   But with the nannies, I've observed, you know, it's kind of largely silence.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.800]   And maybe one of the reasons why is because I would say 90 plus percent of the nannies,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.920]   at least here in San Francisco, are not native English speakers.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.360]   So if you're going to go the nanny route, I would explicitly tell them to stay off their
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.720]   phones during playtime.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:29.600]   And if you're having a difficult decision on whether to return to work or stay at home,
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.240]   I would choose staying at home if you can afford to because nobody will care more about
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.080]   your child than you.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.040]   Sixth point, there's three more points by the way.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.720]   There is no discrimination.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.560]   I didn't feel one sense of exclusion from moms in the two years.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.200]   You know, you sometimes hear the stories about moms just pushing dad's side or mocking them
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.960]   behind their backs or in front of their faces about being a stay-at-home parent.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.160]   I experienced none of that out of all my outings.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.880]   I was never made to feel embarrassed or feel bad about being a stay-at-home dad.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.640]   I was actually felt good.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.800]   You know, moms were very interactive.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.560]   They were very supportive.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.080]   And nobody really said, "Where's your wife?" or "What does your wife do?" or whatever.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.880]   That's probably because my wife was largely with me most of the time on our public outings.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.000]   But I don't know, maybe it's also because San Francisco is a much more accepting city.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Not sure.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.560]   You know, one time I went for a walk with a mom's group in Golden Gate Park and we decided
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.020]   to take a break under a large tree.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.040]   And then all the moms started to breastfeed their children but only one of them had a
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.560]   shawl and that was all right in front of me.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.780]   So it was actually me who felt a little bit embarrassed or a little out of place.
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.540]   So I went for a walk to give them privacy.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:52.620]   And I think this is a demonstration that men, we men, when we're stay-at-home dads, we probably
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:15:00.280]   have this self-doubt and these type of feelings more – we're thinking about it more than
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.400]   the reality of how other people see us.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:08.480]   So for all the stay-at-home dads out there, I would just say own your stay-at-home dadness.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.360]   Be proud that you're a stay-at-home dad.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.920]   It's the most important job in the world.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.440]   Don't say, "Oh, I retired early and while your wife works."
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.440]   Just say you're a stay-at-home dad.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.100]   You don't have to feel embarrassed at all.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.360]   Just own it.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.120]   The share of stay-at-home parents that are dads is steadily increasing.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.040]   So in 1970, that percentage was like, I don't know, 2%.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.600]   I'm looking at this chart in my post.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.940]   And now in the year 2019, that percentage is 20%.
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:45.080]   So that's a huge six to seven-fold increase over the past 40, 50 years.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.860]   And I think that's going to continue to increase if you look at the upward sloping
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.080]   trend line.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.000]   So be proud, dads.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.480]   Seven, I wish I started sooner.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.920]   I find that men are a little too relaxed about when to have children because we don't have
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.140]   that same biological pressure as women do.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.160]   We like to avoid the subject for as long as possible.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.280]   But I think that's not fair to women who want to have children and it's not fair
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.680]   to our partners who assume, I would think, largely assume that maybe a family is on the
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.800]   horizon if they're going to marry you.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.000]   So I think it's very important to have a mature discussion early on in your relationship.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.140]   And I wish I did because I was just go, go, go in my 20s and I really only seriously started
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.720]   thinking and talking about children at around age 33.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.620]   There's no harm talking and thinking, folks.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.480]   So I think we should all do more of it.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.440]   Physically, I'm still holding up pretty well, but I'm definitely not as limber as I used
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.000]   to be as it takes me longer to recover from a cold or a sports injury.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Man, I mean, seriously, these injuries used to take me like two weeks, three weeks to
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   recover.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.160]   Now it takes me a month or two months.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.080]   After about the age of 45, I'm not sure if my body would be able to handle all the necessary
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.600]   bending over and caring anymore.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.440]   So there's a deadline, folks.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.400]   Even our minds might be stronger than our bodies.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.800]   There is a deadline and I wouldn't really test our bodies because biologically they're
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.560]   not conforming to our later stage marriages and family formations.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.280]   And here's the eighth and final takeaway.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.800]   As a dad, you never feel like you're doing enough.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.440]   I'm constantly in awe of my wife because of her patience, kindness, and ability to naturally
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.800]   feed our boy when he was a baby.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.440]   I've never seen my wife upset over these past two years.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.840]   She's had times where she's had to walk away and just cool down, but it's never been something
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.160]   upset, yelling, hitting, or nothing.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:45.040]   I mean, it's been amazing because a baby will test your patience, I guarantee you.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.440]   As a stay-at-home dad, my son and I have a close connection.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.160]   I think we really do.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.040]   But it's not as close as the connection he has with his mom, largely because of the nursing
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.000]   and more time she's spending with him.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.760]   As a result, I used to feel a little sad and a little jealous when he would cry out to
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.400]   mommy while I was still right there in the room playing with him.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.520]   I would think to myself, "What am I, chopped liver or something?"
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.920]   And because I'm unable to nurse our boy, I try to make up for my deficiency in other
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.920]   ways.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:21.480]   Cleaning, driving, grocery shopping, playing, washing dishes, ordering food, and so forth.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.880]   I throw myself deep into my work in order to feel that power of being a provider and
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.160]   feeling useful again.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.240]   And again, one of the earlier points, "Have children and the money will come."
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   It just goes back to that desire for a man to want to provide and feel useful.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.600]   And slowly I'm starting to feel more and more worthy of being a father.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.160]   As he gets older, I hope all he'll want to do is play with his old man.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.260]   It's just such a weird feeling to never feel like you're doing enough, no matter how hard
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.260]   you try.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.260]   But I think it's just going to get better over time.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.480]   After two years of being a stay-at-home dad, I'm firmly, firmly on the side of the rest
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.920]   of the world that provides six to 12 months of parental leave after having a baby.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   For a woman to return to work after three months seems cruel.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   Seems cruel.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:17.720]   I've witnessed the recovery period and it is not easy, especially if you have a C-section.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.720]   Give me a break.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.840]   Are you going to return to work after a C-section within several months?
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.440]   It just doesn't seem right.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.520]   All a baby wants to do at that age is to be with his or her mother and father.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:35.080]   One doctor said it best, nine months to create, nine months to heal.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.920]   Unfortunately, companies aren't in the business of subsidizing our personal life decisions
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.480]   regarding having children.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.960]   And I think we all understand that.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:47.080]   Having children is personal and we need to take responsibility to care for that child.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.180]   My hope is that American institutions will soon start to offer some type of token paid
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.400]   parental time off for at least the first child.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   Why not?
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.600]   The rest of the developed world does that.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.080]   So in conclusion, I just want to say congrats to all the stay-at-home parents out there
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.760]   for doing so much to take care of your children while your partner or spouse is also trying
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.080]   to make it work and provide for your family.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.320]   And if you're a single parent, just keep on grinding forward.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.180]   I think we've got to look into the future.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.040]   No phase lasts forever and I think we need to enjoy it.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.920]   So thanks so much for letting me reflect on my time as a stay-at-home dad.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.000]   And son, I love you so, so much and I look forward to spending so much time with you
