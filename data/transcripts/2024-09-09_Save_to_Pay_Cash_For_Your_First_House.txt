[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.520]   a historic Main Street charms you,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.120]   and every day brings a new adventure.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.800]   Welcome to Park City, Utah, naturally winter's
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.680]   favorite town.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.960]   Join the experience at visitparkcity.com.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.960]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.040]   to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.520]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.820]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.360]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I'm your host,
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.440]   and today we're gonna deal with one of those topics
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.100]   that is absolutely a core component of financial freedom,
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.080]   as we continue our podcast series called
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.600]   Financial Goals That Everybody Should Set.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.720]   And today I wanna try to persuade you to set a goal
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.720]   to buy a debt-free house.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.740]   And ideally, to buy your first house debt-free,
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.560]   meaning with cash.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.880]   Now, for many of my listeners, it'll be too late for that,
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.200]   because you've already bought a house,
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.880]   and you bought a house with a mortgage, and that's fine.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120]   We can talk at another time about the value
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.920]   of paying off a mortgage.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.960]   But if you have children, or if you have grandchildren,
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.000]   or you have nieces and nephews,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.800]   or if you have young people that you like,
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.220]   I wanna persuade you to try to talk to them
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.220]   to set a goal of paying cash for their first house.
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.380]   In the previous podcast episode in this series,
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.940]   we talked about the value of buying a house,
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.100]   and how buying a house can so many times
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.380]   form a foundation to your financial life
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.900]   that is enormously powerful,
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.580]   and it can be an incredibly valuable financial asset
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.620]   for you to own.
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.580]   And I'm not saying that nobody
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.820]   should ever take out a mortgage.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.900]   I think that buying a house with a mortgage
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.180]   is better than not buying a house at all.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.040]   But the spirit of this podcast series is to say
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.200]   that a lot of times we can achieve the goals
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.860]   that we set for ourselves.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.540]   But one of the reasons we don't achieve more goals
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.980]   is because we don't have the creativity
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.820]   or the vision to set goals that we believe in,
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.860]   yet goals that are ambitious and take us to a higher level.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.620]   And I believe this is one of those goals.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.380]   And so I wanna persuade you, especially if you are young,
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.500]   I wanna persuade you to set this goal.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.820]   Now, this is not a goal that I had when I was younger,
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.180]   but I wish I had.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.460]   And this is a goal that I wish to impart to my children
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.460]   because I believe it can provide a powerful foundation
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.060]   for a phenomenal life that really balances
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.380]   the needs of life, the experience of life,
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.700]   and building a positive lifestyle for yourself
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.260]   and for your family with long-term financial accumulation.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.260]   Years ago, I read a book by an author named Steve Maxwell,
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.460]   and the book was called "Buying a House Debt-Free."
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.980]   I interviewed Steven Maxwell on the podcast.
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.960]   So I will look up that podcast episode
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.660]   and link you back to the previous episode
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.900]   if you'd like to listen to the interview with him.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.580]   It was an okay interview.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.960]   If my memory serves, it wound up being more personal
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.260]   rather than action-oriented,
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.740]   which is what I wanted to cover
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.180]   and what I still wanna cover.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.380]   But in the book, "Buying a House Debt-Free,"
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.900]   Maxwell describes the story from his family
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.640]   of how he inspired and taught his children
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.220]   to save money towards the purchase of a house.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.540]   And in fact, all of his sons, I think he has four sons,
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.380]   all of his sons during their 20s, before they were married,
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.020]   were able to pay cash for their first house.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.340]   Some of them bought a house very early,
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.300]   some as young as 19 or 21.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.000]   I think the latest of them bought a house at about age 29,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.060]   and the price range of the houses
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.900]   varied from a little under $100,000
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.940]   to one being somewhere between $200,000 and $300,000
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.020]   if my memory serves correctly.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.860]   And when I read that book, I realized that, wait a second,
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.260]   this is actually not that difficult of a formula,
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.300]   that many young people, if they were inspired and motivated
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.900]   and had a guide and a mentor to show them how,
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.120]   absolutely could save money and pay cash
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.060]   for their first house.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.020]   Let's go through a little bit of math so you understand it.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.580]   Maxwell's basic formula that he taught his children
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.380]   was, number one, to work during school.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.580]   They were a homeschooling family,
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.840]   they homeschooled all their children
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.380]   all the way through high school.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.280]   And as part of their homeschooling,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.780]   they would do their coursework probably in the morning,
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.540]   and then they encouraged all of their children to get jobs
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.660]   or to build businesses in the afternoon.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.700]   And by the way, as a homeschooling advocate,
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.260]   this has been one of my favorite reasons to homeschool.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.660]   I think that the use of the extended school day
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.300]   is often enormously inefficient for young people,
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.300]   and we want to get some of that time back.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.820]   And it's not hard at all to finish
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.980]   a standard school curriculum for a normal student
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.660]   in about three to four hours a day of actual work.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.660]   What happens is that most students
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.700]   spend eight hours of their day,
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.060]   and only three or four hours is actually,
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.660]   excuse me, most students who are going to school
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.100]   have eight hours of their day
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.860]   sucked up by their school obligations,
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.200]   but only about, say, three or four hours of it
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.860]   is actually productive.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.820]   When you're homeschooling,
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.100]   you can just do the productive three or four hours,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.640]   and you can be done by noon.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.220]   When I was younger, in my own family,
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.140]   we were homeschooled from 8 a.m. till noon,
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.760]   had some homework in the afternoon on occasion,
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.020]   but four hours a day of a focused student
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.420]   is pretty doable.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.060]   Now, if you're finished with school every day by noon,
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.020]   and you're an active young teenager,
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.620]   especially one who's able and willing to go
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.940]   and get a job or start a business,
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.140]   all of a sudden now you have
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.780]   a dramatically higher earning potential
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.440]   than many other students who have their entire day
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.820]   taken over by school obligations.
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.140]   So let's figure out what the earning potential
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.540]   of a teenager might be,
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.140]   even if a teenager is earning a relatively basic wage.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.940]   Now, I don't know exactly what number
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.260]   you want to choose for this,
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.780]   but I'm gonna use an average hourly earnings
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.900]   of about $15 an hour.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.100]   I think that if you think of many "teenager jobs,"
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.540]   someone manning an ice cream shop
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.100]   or working at a fast food restaurant,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.860]   perhaps the starting wage might be $12 or $13 an hour
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.300]   in some areas.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.140]   Perhaps in some areas it may be $10 an hour.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.820]   I doubt that in your area it's that.
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.180]   I would guess that in most cases,
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.240]   $15 an hour would be a fairly reasonable number to use.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.860]   At any rate, I'm not going to increase
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.100]   to account for cost of living increases and inflation
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.980]   or skill advancement or promotions.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.220]   I'm just gonna use a flat earnings figure of $15 an hour.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.940]   Let's assume that a student is able to work during school.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.820]   Let's pretend that you homeschooled
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.380]   and your student was done by 12 or one o'clock.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.220]   And let's assume that your student could do
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.700]   four hours a day of work every afternoon
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.680]   from say one o'clock p.m. to five o'clock p.m.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.260]   Well, four hours a day, five days a week,
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.260]   that's 20 hours per week.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.780]   If someone is earning $15 an hour at 20 hours per week,
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.740]   that's a gross income of $300 per week.
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.460]   If that continues 52 weeks per year with no vacations,
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.780]   that would be $15,600 per year.
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.580]   So at four hours a day, five days a week,
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.140]   weekends totally free, we're at $15,600 per year.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.620]   Take off a week or two of vacation,
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.580]   assume that there's no paid vacation.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.620]   Let's just round that to $15,000 per year.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.300]   Now, what if you did that all during high school?
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.300]   Well, assuming again, no increases, $15,000 per year,
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.780]   over the course of four years would be a total earnings
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.740]   of $60,000 during high school.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.600]   Let's assume we continue that during high school years
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.240]   and the first four years after high school, college years.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.020]   Well, now we're at about $120,000 of income earned
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.140]   from work, that is quite a lot of money.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.120]   Now, what are the necessary expenses of this person?
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.540]   Well, here's where things can go very differently
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.900]   depending on the vision of the young person.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.220]   If the young person has a vision for staying at home,
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.240]   living rent-free with mom and dad,
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.660]   keeping expenses very modest,
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.700]   spending only the necessary amount of money
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.340]   to live a reasonable lifestyle,
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.700]   then it's not unreasonable for a student
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.160]   who may be 20, 22 years old
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.460]   to have a hundred and something thousand dollars saved,
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.540]   even with just basic earnings.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.700]   What does a teenager need to spend money on?
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.360]   He might need to purchase a little bit of clothing
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.060]   for himself, assuming that his parents
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.020]   aren't giving him the money for that.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.480]   Obviously, different people have different clothing budgets.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.980]   I would think that somewhere between 500 and $1,000 a year
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.220]   would be a very reasonable budget
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.860]   for a young person to be spending on clothing.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.060]   The teen is undoubtedly gonna have some expenses
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.100]   for social activities.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.140]   When I was in college, my budget was about $200 a month
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.620]   for social activities.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.860]   So let's call it two to $3,000 a year
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.460]   for social activities for a frugal teen.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.060]   Let's assume that the teen needs some transportation.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.880]   Ideally, he or she should wait and not buy a car
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.820]   if it can be avoided, if he can arrange his lifestyle
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.400]   so that he doesn't need a car, that would be ideal.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.700]   But if you need some wheels, four or $5,000
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.120]   for a reasonable vehicle, I think would be fine.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.140]   There's gonna be some driving expenses,
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.420]   the insurance expenses, and then we move to things
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.900]   like educational expenses,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.780]   which I'm gonna deal with separately.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.800]   The point is that even a student
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.900]   who's working a modest amount,
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.820]   if he has a vision to save money towards a specific goal,
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.700]   a big goal that will motivate him to accumulate money
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.400]   and continue to express frugality,
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.840]   then accumulating $100,000 is not that difficult,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.440]   even just on 20 hours per week.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.160]   Now, let's assume that we wanted to increase it a little bit
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.840]   or adjust the numbers a little bit.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.840]   Let's assume that this teen were willing to work more
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.540]   than what I've described.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.260]   Let's keep four hours a day during the school year
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.260]   and a full 10-hour day on Saturday as our work schedule.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.680]   I don't think this is unreasonable, by the way.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.760]   At one point, when I was in college
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.440]   for a year and a half, about a year,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.520]   during the school year, I had three different jobs
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.160]   and I did a schedule something like this.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   My first job was an on-campus work-study job
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.160]   where I just had some random bird brain job on campus
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.520]   where I worked for a few hours a day
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.920]   and did that about four days a week.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.840]   Then on Thursday nights, Friday nights, and Saturday nights,
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.480]   I had a job running a bicycle rickshaw
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.540]   where I was pedaling a bicycle taxi
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.200]   in the downtown area where I went to school.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.080]   Thursday nights, I would go out from about six o'clock
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.800]   till 10 or 11 o'clock.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.920]   Friday nights, I would work from about five or 6 p.m.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.420]   till about 2 a.m., and then Saturday night, same thing,
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.800]   about five or 6 a.m. till about 2 a.m.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.920]   And then on Saturdays during the day at that season of life,
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.400]   I had a construction job where I would work
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.320]   from about 8 a.m. till about 4 p.m.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.320]   Then I would take a shower, change,
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.720]   and go to my next job on Saturday night.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.920]   And I did that during the school year
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.200]   for pretty much an entire school year.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.480]   So I've done it.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.840]   I had Sundays off.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.840]   That was when I did homework on Sunday afternoons,
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.280]   went to church on Sunday mornings, had plenty of time,
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.360]   other time during the week to do some homework
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.440]   on Mondays through Wednesdays, and it worked.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.160]   It was okay, it was fine.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.560]   So my point is I don't think that working 30 hours a week
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.320]   is an unreasonable number to use.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.080]   So let's assume that our young student
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.660]   works 30 hours a week during the school year.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.640]   School year is normally about 40 weeks per year,
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.480]   earning $15 an hour.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.360]   During the summer, let's assume that he kicks it up
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.800]   and works 45 hours a week, either five nine-hour days
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.720]   or some eight-hour days during the weekend
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.120]   and some Saturday work, and again, earning $15 an hour.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.680]   So his total annual earnings in that scenario
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.380]   would be $26,100.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.880]   Do that over four years, you're at about $104,400.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.460]   Do it over eight years, you're at $208,800.
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.320]   So I think it's perfectly reasonable
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.040]   that over the course of about eight years,
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.160]   a motivated, focused young man or woman
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.560]   could attend to his or her studies, could work,
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.520]   and still accumulate $100,000 or $200,000
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.720]   to purchase some form of a starter house.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.840]   It's a totally doable thing.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.340]   I haven't in any way made an unreasonable calculation.
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.200]   I think that this is the most basic reasonable thing
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.240]   that I could do.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.880]   For example, I didn't take any creative license
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.160]   or teach any courses on how to get paid
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.180]   a lot more than $15 an hour.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.520]   But I think that many, if not most, motivated young people
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.880]   with a little bit of coaching
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.520]   could certainly earn more than $15 an hour.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.320]   If you develop some academic skill in an area
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.560]   and you start tutoring,
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.200]   I think easily you could earn double $15 an hour
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.360]   even as a high school student or a college student
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.520]   doing tutoring.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.000]   I haven't focused on any skill acquisition
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.360]   to where you actually develop and build skills.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.560]   And over the course of an eight-year calculation,
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.240]   I think that's a little ridiculous.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.380]   I haven't shown you earning any kinds of certifications.
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.200]   One thing that Maxwell's children did really well
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.560]   was they focused a lot on computer certifications,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.120]   IT certifications.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.020]   And so his children developed skills
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.440]   taking IT certifications.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.840]   And then they actually turned around
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.600]   and the young people themselves developed their own academy,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.120]   teaching the necessary knowledge
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.400]   so that their students
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.200]   could earn their own IT certifications.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.640]   One of Maxwell's daughters became an accomplished author
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.960]   and wrote quite a number of children's books
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.960]   that were marketed through their family's overall plan,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.000]   their overall business and their brand.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.440]   So there are quite a lot of things that young people can do
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.760]   that I haven't taken into account.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.120]   And by the way, I didn't take into account
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.480]   even starting earlier.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.040]   I assume that we're dealing here with a ninth grader,
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.300]   but I don't see any reason why seventh and eighth graders
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.040]   shouldn't have age appropriate jobs,
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.120]   especially that can lead towards them
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.160]   developing advanced skills.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.040]   So if a teenager has a goal
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.480]   of accumulating a significant amount of money,
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.880]   a hundred or $200,000 to buy a house,
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.680]   it's very reasonable that that goal could be accomplished
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.160]   within six, eight, 10 years,
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.160]   even if he's not earning an extravagant amount of money.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.780]   So why don't most teens accomplish this?
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:23.200]   Quite simply, in my experience, they don't have the goal.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.680]   Instead, they look around and they see cool things to buy
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.400]   and they start spending money on cool things.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.420]   They see fancy sneakers
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.520]   that are gonna give them social status and they buy them.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.560]   They see cool hobbies that often wind up
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.640]   sucking significant amounts of money out of their budget.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.520]   They buy fancy stuff that's not necessary,
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.560]   fancy cars, fancy gear,
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.340]   engage in all kinds of things
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.760]   that suck money out of the bank account.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.560]   And then often, because teenagers don't have a big goal,
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.920]   if they have a choice between working
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.640]   for money they don't need
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.500]   and hanging out, doing something fun and interesting,
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.300]   then it's easy to choose the thing that is fun
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.620]   and interesting rather than the thing that is hard,
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.180]   namely work.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.800]   So understand this clearly.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.620]   If a teenager has a clear and compelling goal
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.540]   that has a big price tag,
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.340]   a price tag such as paying cash for a house,
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:24.100]   then he has a reason now to earn more money
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.080]   and to spend less money.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.140]   And as a parent, you can support him in that process
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.660]   by helping him to develop his income,
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.700]   helping him to live very low cost
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.260]   by providing food and shelter for him.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.500]   And you can be the catalyst
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.380]   for his establishing himself
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.620]   in a strong position as a young man
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.100]   or for your daughters as young women.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.140]   Now, why might somebody want to actually achieve
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.380]   and accomplish this goal?
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.060]   Well, first and foremost,
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.500]   I think that it's transformative
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.480]   in terms of changing how somebody views
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.420]   his or her capacities in life.
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.180]   When you set a big goal and you achieve it,
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.900]   it transforms fundamentally who you are.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.780]   Longtime listeners of "Radical Personal Finance"
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.300]   have heard me many times tell the story
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.140]   of how I paid off my student loans
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.020]   before I graduated from college.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.100]   I feel a little ashamed to keep telling the story,
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.380]   but you can tell that it was a transformative experience
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.460]   in my life.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.860]   I read Dave Ramsey's book.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.620]   After a few readings, I said, you know what?
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.540]   Dave's right, I'm gonna pay off my debt.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.900]   And so I set a goal.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.540]   I had no clue how I would accomplish it,
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.740]   but I said, I wanna see if I can pay off my student loans
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.980]   before I graduate.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.100]   I still had a year and a half of college to pay for,
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.180]   so I needed to prioritize finishing
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.340]   my expensive tuition payments,
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.620]   but I wanted to save money and pay off my school loans.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.460]   So I set a goal and I did it.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.660]   Two weeks before I graduated,
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.580]   I paid off my student loans.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.820]   That experience transformed my life.
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.700]   It taught me so much about my capacity,
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.780]   lessons that to this day I still hearken back to
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.580]   in my own thinking and in my own planning.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.860]   Having the big goal gave me the reasons
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.260]   to organize my schedule, organize my time,
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.220]   and it started to cause things to happen for me.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.420]   For example, I switched from a low paying job
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.260]   that consumed a lot of hours to a higher paying job
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.200]   that consumed fewer hours of my time and paid me more money.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.620]   That put me on the pathway towards achieving that goal.
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.540]   When I set the goal,
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.220]   then I had to figure out how to go to class and keep my job.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.740]   I had a 40 hour a week job.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.700]   And so I went to my boss and I said,
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.060]   would you be willing to allow me to work flexible hours?
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.240]   And he said, well, show me how you can do that.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.440]   Show me how you could go to school,
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.980]   take your classes and accomplish your work
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.380]   that I'm paying you for.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.420]   So I had to sit down and create a time budget
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.800]   and I made a spreadsheet and I accounted
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.100]   for every hour of my weekly schedule.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.740]   And what I found out was when I made a weekly schedule
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.740]   that included my classes, homework time for each class,
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.000]   driving back and forth, time for social activities,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.860]   time for work, all of the stuff that I needed to do,
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.820]   there was plenty of time for me to do all of those things
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.380]   without any problems.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.820]   So I worked 40 hours a week.
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.180]   I took 19 hours of class.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.340]   I got straight A's.
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.220]   I saw my family.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.060]   I went to church.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.980]   I had socializing time built in
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.780]   on Friday night and Saturday night.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.060]   And I studied on Sunday afternoons
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.860]   and it all was fine.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.660]   And to this day, that is a lesson
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.460]   that I cannot get away from.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.100]   In addition, things started to happen
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.180]   because I had a clear goal that really helped.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.140]   My boss gave me just free money,
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.500]   wrote me a scholarship and said,
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.740]   "Hey, here's extra,"
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.660]   I can't remember if it was three or $4,000,
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.420]   "and here's some extra money to help you
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.980]   in your pursuit of your goals."
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.900]   And so things started to happen.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.580]   It was a transformative experience
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.220]   because it was the first time I set a big goal
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.140]   and accomplished it.
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.540]   Now imagine you going through that.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.100]   Imagine your son, your daughter going through that
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.540]   at a young age.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.660]   And imagine now the confidence that comes
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.260]   from knowing, yeah, I got this.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.260]   I got this, even at a young age.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.940]   See, young people, we spend all of our time
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.460]   focused on academics, which I'm hugely in favor of,
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.100]   but not to the exclusion of finances.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.620]   I think the finances can be really transformative.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.780]   Now, in addition, imagine the security and the options
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.180]   that having this money opens up for your child
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.700]   while he or she is saving the money
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.500]   on the pathway to buying a house.
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.300]   Instead of being flat broke in high school,
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.500]   your child or you or whomever you're engaged with
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.260]   is accustomed to having thousands
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.700]   or tens of thousands of dollars accumulated.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.340]   That completely transforms the psychology of a teenager
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.460]   to know that I did this.
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.660]   I earned and saved these tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.540]   Imagine, as a young man or a young woman,
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.900]   you got $100,000 in your bank account.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.700]   You're 21 years old, 23 years old, 25 years old.
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.700]   You're now in the top quartile, top 40% or 30,
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.540]   I don't know the number off the top of my head.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.540]   You're in the top part of society.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.140]   Imagine the other things that are available to you
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.780]   that weren't before.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.620]   Now, if you want to move to take a better job,
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.580]   you don't have to go and borrow money from dad to move.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.620]   Now, if there's a really great school
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.100]   that you want to go to,
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.660]   but you don't quite have all the money,
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.060]   you've saved the money.
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.780]   Now, if there's an experience that you think is worth it
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.940]   and it requires you to buy some plane tickets
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.420]   or whatever it is, you've got it.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.300]   Now, if you wanna start a business, you've got the money.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.100]   Saving for a house doesn't mean
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.460]   that you actually have to be the one
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.300]   to buy the house in the year planned.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.420]   The pathway towards the accomplishment of financial goals
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.540]   often has a lot of twists and turns.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.900]   So maybe your 19-year-old is earning $15 an hour,
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.460]   but he realizes, you know what?
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.860]   If I bought my own truck and my own equipment,
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.140]   I could start this little part-time business here.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.740]   And my hourly wage doing that would be 30 bucks.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.980]   And I could double my income by just spending $7,000
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.380]   on gear and equipment.
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.860]   There's a great investment.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.860]   Or imagine that your teen comes across
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.980]   something really cheap.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:23.100]   Maybe it's an antique that she finds at a local store.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.620]   Maybe it's vintage clothing that she rustles up
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.500]   in a local shop or finds at yard sales.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.820]   Maybe he's flipping cars and gets a car dealer license
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.100]   and buys cheap cars and starts flipping them.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.140]   Now we can start to grow the money through investment
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.660]   because he has investment capital saved.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.700]   And he's not just now entirely dependent
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.220]   on a job to accomplish it.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.340]   What I'm trying to demonstrate
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.020]   with the income earning numbers
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.860]   is that it's a reasonable to set a goal
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.420]   to save 100 or $200,000 for a house.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.060]   That's a reasonable goal to set, even for a teenager.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.260]   It's a big goal, but it's a reasonable goal
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.060]   because it can be done on earnings.
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.860]   But ideally, as your teen accumulates that capital,
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.940]   now he has a reason to learn about the management of capital,
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.420]   how to make it grow, how to invest it.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.860]   Now let's move now to the actual accomplishment
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.140]   of the house, purchasing the house.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.860]   One of the things that I, is my favorite thing
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.640]   about Steve Maxwell's book, "Buying a House Debt-Free"
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.460]   is that his sons were able to buy a house
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.120]   before getting married.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.120]   Now imagine how joy-filled you would be as a parent
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.320]   to know that your son has purchased a home
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.660]   that he can bring his bride into
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.580]   and that their marriage starts
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.300]   on a financially stable foundation.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.160]   When you're old and rich, having a mortgage on the house
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.660]   doesn't matter all that much.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.460]   You've got the money, you can pay for it,
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.940]   you have other assets.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.980]   But when you're young and just getting started
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.980]   and you're building a family,
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.780]   there's so much uncertainty in that time.
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.380]   And there's often so much stress that is incurred
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.820]   by having a lot of bills.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:10.860]   But I can't imagine a young person or a young couple
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.500]   who, if they didn't have rent
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.740]   and they didn't have a mortgage payment,
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.040]   I can't imagine anyone who can't make it
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.100]   in that circumstance because paying for housing
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.860]   is usually our biggest budget category.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.300]   So now you have opportunity,
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.860]   you can do things you otherwise wouldn't do,
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.860]   and you have stability.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.620]   And that's what we want.
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.100]   I personally think that young people should have a goal
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.160]   to get married young.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.900]   I think early 20s is ideal.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.380]   Somewhere between 20, 22, 23, hopefully before 25.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.460]   I think early 20s is the ideal time to get married.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.180]   And so, and also I think that's a great time
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.900]   to start having children.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.380]   The current plan we're on of waiting until 33 to marry
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.920]   and then planning to have a baby at 37
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.860]   just ain't working for most people.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.060]   And that's a very painful reality.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.380]   So when you listen to young people and you say,
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.980]   why aren't you having children?
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.980]   Why aren't you married?
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.500]   Again and again and again, they say money.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.900]   Now, as you've heard from past podcast episodes,
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.020]   I don't believe that money is a legitimate objection
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.740]   to getting married or having children.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.060]   I think that, but I understand that people say that it is.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.420]   So let's get rid of that problem and let's buy a house.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.820]   Let's make sure that a young man is able to have
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.940]   a paid off house that he can bring his bride home to.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.140]   And he can do it at 19 or he can do it at 21
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.300]   or he can do it at 24.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.060]   It's a doable goal.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.580]   And that's something that will build
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.940]   the non-financial side of life in a really powerful way,
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.380]   much more so than just the financial side of life.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.940]   I want to pivot now to a couple of additional points
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.460]   and provisos that I think need to be heard.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.260]   Don't get too bogged down
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.700]   in the actual dollars and cents calculations.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.100]   I'm giving you a simple example
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.160]   to try to demonstrate to a teenager
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.060]   in a way that I will with my own children,
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.460]   say you can make this happen.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.900]   Now in your area,
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.380]   there may not be any $100,000 houses available.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.900]   Your child may wind up going and living in San Francisco
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.660]   and that's fine.
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.580]   One of the reasons you start working towards a goal
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.820]   is because the clarity that comes with it
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.420]   can often make things happen serendipitously.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:30.300]   I can well imagine a young man who saved $130,000,
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.140]   but who needs $250,000 to buy a reasonable house,
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:38.660]   being given a gift straight up of cash by his grandfather
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.500]   who says, "John, I've been watching you work
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.700]   and work towards this goal for eight years.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.260]   Here's 70,000, here's $100,000
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.020]   to get you moved into that house."
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.700]   That's fantastic.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.720]   I can also well imagine a young couple saying,
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.820]   "You know what, we've saved $150,000
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.260]   and it just doesn't seem like we should be living
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.260]   in a $150,000 house,
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.260]   but there's this nice 250 or $300,000 house over here.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.340]   Let's go ahead and make a big giant down payment
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.580]   and get that thing
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.340]   and then pay it off really aggressively."
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.820]   That would be fine.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.280]   In addition, I think it's also reasonable
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.940]   that this money could be used for other purposes,
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.060]   but having a goal, a goal that is clear and simple,
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.980]   not something fuzzy like,
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.860]   "Hey, someday you'll be 22 years old
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:26.880]   and you'll want to start a business."
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.940]   No, for young people especially,
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.660]   the goal is buy a house.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.380]   It's simple, clear.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.940]   And when you get to buy a house debt-free, excuse me,
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.140]   buy a house debt-free, it's simple and clear.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.320]   That means that it's probably gonna be able
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.820]   to be executed on.
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.100]   And then when you get to 24 years old or 27 years old
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.700]   and you're trying to make those decisions,
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.600]   you can enter into a fresh counseling process
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.500]   to decide what should we actually do at this point in time.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.860]   Having a big goal allows you to save the money
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.700]   that opens up other things in your life.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.300]   Now, as I wrap up this show,
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.780]   I want to give one more caution or warning.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.740]   I have a concern that the clarity and power
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.760]   of this particular goal may be so compelling
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.300]   that it may keep some students
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:22.300]   from pursuing things that have a longer term,
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.740]   higher payoff.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.100]   I can well imagine one of my children latching on
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.300]   to the power and the beauty of this particular goal
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.980]   and saying, "I'm gonna do it.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.220]   After all, no one does it, I'm gonna do it."
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:40.300]   And I can well imagine one of my children becoming obsessed
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.140]   with earning as much money now
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.940]   at the age of 15 as possible.
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.540]   That happens frequently.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.860]   The problem is that things that a 15-year-old
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:53.420]   often does to earn money may keep the 15-year-old
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.380]   from doing the things that could result
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.620]   in earning a lot of money down the road.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.300]   I pay a lot of attention to the teenagers in my life,
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.540]   and I like to see a teenager working a job.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.900]   I think that's great.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.260]   I think there are things that you learn about life
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.020]   and about yourself,
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.180]   working a job that you don't learn in other ways.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.340]   And I think it's especially important
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.100]   that teenagers go out and get their own jobs
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.660]   and that they're the ones who choose the jobs
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.300]   that they're doing with parental permission
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.740]   and that they earn their own money.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.980]   That's a really transformative experience
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.980]   in a young man or woman's life.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.980]   However, I get really concerned
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.180]   if a teenager is working a low-level dead-end job
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.900]   for a long time.
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.740]   Now, I don't mean to be insulting.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.340]   I mean to be practical and honest with what I'm saying.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.220]   Recently, I was talking to a 17-year-old,
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.100]   and for almost a year,
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.900]   she had been working at a Chick-fil-A
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.500]   just as a front-counter service order-taker,
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.460]   and she was really enjoying her work.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.060]   It was a great social outlet for her.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.660]   She was making some money.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.580]   Great.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.740]   Then the Chick-fil-A closed for renovations,
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.180]   and she went and got a job at Dunkin' Donuts.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.420]   And I opened my mouth and said,
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.220]   "Listen, I'm glad you've been working
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.580]   "at this job for a year.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.060]   "I think that's wonderful.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.120]   "I'm gonna be really sad if, for the next year,
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.500]   "you're still working in fast food."
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.340]   Why?
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:21.300]   Because she has enormous potential in academics
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.300]   and in the development of a career and high-value skills
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.900]   that would be totally wasted if she works
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:34.680]   in a fast food restaurant for the coming years.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.900]   Now, the good thing is, I think, I hope,
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.740]   that she has learned that,
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.980]   that by interacting with some of her coworkers
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.900]   who are in a different social circle
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.940]   and a different social class than her,
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.420]   she's realizing that this might not be
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.900]   where I wanna be for 10 years,
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.060]   even though I can make 13.25 an hour,
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.220]   that, really, I wanna be somewhere different.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.700]   And, by the way, also wonderfully,
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.480]   she got the job, made thousands of dollars,
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.820]   lost it all through frivolous living,
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.860]   and now has the pain of being broke.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.420]   So that's a really good lesson for a teenager to learn.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.920]   All of that is good.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.580]   So I don't wanna say don't work a fast food restaurant job,
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.640]   but I wanna always caution against an excessive focus
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.780]   on making money now as compared to seeing the long-term,
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.540]   seeing the big picture.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:28.540]   I believe that a motivated teenager with academic ability
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.020]   who focuses on his or her academics
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.000]   will go much, much farther, much, much faster
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.480]   than someone who goes out and gets a job
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.100]   to start making some basic wage.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.380]   And this would be where I significantly disagree
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.260]   with Steve Maxwell and his book.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.820]   Maxwell focuses a lot on homeschooling,
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.700]   on helping your children to be self-employed,
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.940]   and actively discourages his children, in the book,
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.140]   from attending college.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.400]   I respect that position,
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.260]   but I think it's probably not the right one for most people.
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.820]   It worked out well for his sons.
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.500]   They all developed independent businesses,
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.080]   they became self-employed, they all met wonderful women,
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.660]   they all married and had children,
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.680]   but it didn't work out exactly the same for his daughters.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.100]   They're all very accomplished.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.420]   One is an author, others are in business.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.600]   At least one has bought her own house.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.380]   But two of his daughters, a few years ago,
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.440]   went ahead and went to college later in their 20s.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.940]   And as far as I can tell from their public family blog,
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.540]   his three daughters, though they have money,
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.980]   remain unmarried.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.580]   And I would guess that they would probably all desire
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.660]   to be married.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.300]   And so we just need to be thoughtful
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.140]   and we need to make certain that we don't stay doggedly
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.960]   on one course just for this one goal.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.380]   I can envision a super motivated teenager,
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.340]   working, working, working, working, 23 years old,
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.880]   buys a house, working, working, working,
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.940]   but now all of a sudden didn't get the academic credentials
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.220]   that really would have really been helpful.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.820]   Or I can see the same young man or woman
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:10.240]   may have been so focused on saving money for a house
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.500]   that he or she didn't wanna spend money on college
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.900]   and now missed out on some of the social connections
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.540]   or other life experiences
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.240]   that would have been really useful.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.940]   So set the goal, but be open to counsel
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.540]   and be open to insight.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.420]   As for me, with my children, I want them to set the goal,
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.300]   but I want them to never turn away
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.260]   from academic accomplishment
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.920]   if they're academically oriented.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.260]   Not all people are academically oriented.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.100]   And so that doesn't need to be universal.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.400]   But if a young man or woman is academically oriented,
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.840]   then I think that should be a primary focus,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.240]   even if it means a slower path
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.800]   towards accumulating money for a house.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.960]   So I hope this gentle caution
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.000]   comes through in an appropriate way.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.480]   Set a goal of saving money for a house,
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.140]   but don't work, work, work at a fast food job
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.720]   and not study for a math test,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.080]   when in reality you could be a world-class mathematician.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.600]   And by the way, there's math competitions out there
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.920]   where literally they'll pay you $100,000 for winning them.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.280]   At least in many, some of them are tens of thousands,
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.720]   but they're out there.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.320]   So you can earn money on academics.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.600]   There's competitions for every science, for every skill.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.280]   If you're a great writer, submit your work to essay contests.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.120]   You can make money on your academics.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.480]   And that's to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.720]   of dollars you can gain in college scholarships
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.760]   by being highly qualified with your academics
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.520]   or with your athletics or with some other area of talent.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.760]   And don't be the guy who,
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.460]   and if you go through many years of school
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.400]   and you emerge in your mid or late 20s
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.160]   and you've got a medical degree or you've got a law degree
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.040]   and you only have $43,000 saved in your bank account,
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.340]   because, and you never had the money
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.680]   to pay cash for the house, guess what?
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.000]   It's gonna be fine.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   You're going to be able to quickly buy your house
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.320]   when you are working as a doctor, as a lawyer,
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.680]   as an engineer, as a highly qualified high income earner.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.680]   So be thoughtful about it in the fullness of time.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.460]   Set the goal, inspire young people to do it,
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.360]   do the math with them, help them do it
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.840]   because that big goal will have a transformative effect
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.780]   on their life.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.960]   But recognize that some of these kinds of goals
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.800]   really need a little bit of thoughtfulness with it.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.520]   I guess I'll give one more analogy here
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.800]   to try to emphasize this point.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.640]   I would say that you should hold this goal
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.000]   similar to how you might hold a goal of getting married.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.080]   If a son or daughter of mine comes and says,
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.360]   "Dad, I wanna get married by 23 years old."
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.200]   I'm gonna say, "Absolutely, that's fantastic."
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.240]   But I don't want a 22 year old coming and saying,
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.400]   "Hey dad, I didn't find anyone who was really great,
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.540]   so here's just some random person that I'm gonna marry
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.180]   because the most important thing
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.060]   is me being married by 23."
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.900]   I would say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.580]   It's fine to have a goal
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.900]   because if you have a goal of being married by 23,
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.780]   wonderful, that can be a transformative thing in your life.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.600]   It causes you to say,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.820]   "Well, how can I develop the qualities needed
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.580]   to attract a really high quality spouse?
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.700]   What characteristics do I need?
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.260]   How do I need to present myself?
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.940]   Where am I gonna find said prospective spouse?
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.940]   I'm gonna do the work to meet that person.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.200]   I'm gonna do the work to be prepared for marriage,
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.980]   to be mature, to be strong, to be attractive."
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.060]   All that stuff.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:36.060]   The goal is fundamentally helpful and a good thing to set,
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.660]   but you don't get to 22 years and six months
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.720]   and just randomly go out
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.820]   and pick the first one that'll have you
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.740]   because that'll have a long-term negative impact
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.760]   on your life.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.420]   It's fine to sacrifice the goal of getting married at 23
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.980]   if you're 22 and there's no good quality candidate.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:59.040]   Much better to wait until you're 39 or 72 to marry
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.600]   and marry a really great spouse
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.320]   than to marry poorly at 22.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.880]   So I would say by analogy, kind of a similar thing here.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.100]   Teach a young person to set the goal
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.520]   of paying cash for a house
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.440]   because it's a doable goal
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.240]   and it's a goal that will require a focus
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.240]   for a sustained focus and sustained effort
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.520]   for a long period of time,
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.640]   for five, 10, 15 years of work.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.460]   But don't hold so doggedly to the goal
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.140]   that you just say,
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.260]   "I'm not gonna take this $100,000 out of my bank account
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.340]   and pay for law school
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.060]   when I really know that going to law school
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.380]   is a good idea for me because I have to buy the house."
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:42.620]   No, go to law school, get your legal certifications,
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:46.500]   then buy a house a few years later and take out a mortgage.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.280]   Hope that little caution there
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.260]   doesn't unravel everything that I said
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.700]   in the first part of the show,
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.260]   but I believe it is important
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.260]   that especially with something that is so significant
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.380]   as what I've described,
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.860]   that we just have a little carefulness in our application.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.420]   Thank you for listening to today's podcast.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.820]   I'll be back with you soon.
