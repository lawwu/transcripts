[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.800]   So today when tackling our deep life queries,
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.500]   we actually have a theme.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.600]   Just coincidentally, we had a big cluster of questions
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.700]   that all had to do with parenthood and the impact
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.300]   of parenthood on all other aspects of the deep life.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.900]   And I figured why not just put these together,
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.500]   get into a parenthood deep life mode,
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.300]   and answer a bunch of questions that are all
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.500]   in the same general area.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.400]   So our first such question comes from Nikki.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.800]   Nikki asks, "How does one get a sense of satisfaction
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.600]   from goals that continue ad infinitum?"
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.000]   And she elaborates that she is a self-employed mom of three,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.500]   ages 3.5, two, and three months.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.000]   So she notes that since her first child,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.100]   she's been slowly transitioning what used to be yearly goals
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.800]   to more progress or habit-based goals due
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.300]   to the unpredictability of her time with young children.
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.000]   And she is having some issue with that.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.500]   She finds that, "I will blow away past a book count goal,
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200]   shrug, wake up the next day and keep reading.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.300]   There's always the next project for work or home,
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.300]   and I plan on reading and writing the rest of my life.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.300]   It feels like now that all my goals have been distilled
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.600]   in the habits, they have lost their ability
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.500]   to ever really be complete.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.600]   How can I inject some good old-fashioned crossed-off
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.900]   checkmark, treat-yourself goal satisfaction back
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.500]   into my life?"
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.400]   Well, Nikki, I think it is good to have both types of goals.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.200]   What I'm going to recommend is doing a birthday challenge.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.500]   This is something I do myself, where for each year,
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.200]   as I arrive at my birthday, I have a collection of goals
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800]   I want to accomplish by that birthday.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.200]   I usually call them in my notes "project" and then the age.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.000]   So I'm 39 right now, so I have a project 40
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.300]   that I'm working on.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.400]   And typically, I'll have a halfway point intermediate goal.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.200]   So about halfway through the year or two is my birthday.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.400]   There's intermediate versions of the big goals
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.100]   that you want to accomplish.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.100]   And the birthday-tied goals will typically be themed.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.900]   So it depends on what's happening in your life.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.600]   Like right now, you have very young kids.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.700]   I remember that age well.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.100]   There was a time when I had a four-year-old, a two-year-old,
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.900]   and a newborn.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.900]   So pretty similar to your current distribution.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.100]   I remember that time well.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.100]   We had just moved to Tacoma Park.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.600]   I had recently gotten tenure and was writing for the first time
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.400]   in a long time.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.700]   So this is when I first started.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.800]   I was working on digital minimalism.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   And I hadn't written since Deep Work,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.400]   because I had-- as I've talked about before on the podcast,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.800]   I had to batten down the hatches,
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.300]   because it's just kids are hard.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.000]   And we're going to see this theme
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.500]   through the various questions we're going to answer today.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   But kids are hard.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.100]   And so I wasn't writing books when I was a new father.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.600]   And I was just trying to get tenure.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.300]   But anyways, I remember that period well.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.400]   So the goals I would have had, my birthday goals
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.900]   of that period are probably different than my birthday
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.500]   goals for Project 40, which were very
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.900]   different than my goals for Project 30
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.000]   before I had any kids, for example.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But the point is, it gives you a way to say,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.800]   what am I focusing on this year?
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.500]   And these are aspirational, very focused on your life
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.800]   in the big picture.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.000]   And it's something to go after.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.100]   And it can be very relevant to what's going on.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.100]   I mean, I would really think right now
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.400]   with a bunch of young kids, these
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   might be very lifestyle-focused goals.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.300]   Like, I want to get to a point in our life
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.200]   where we have this set up.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.100]   Or we have figured out how to make the evenings work,
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.300]   or whatever it is, right?
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.200]   Or that we do a weekly dinner with the grandparents.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.300]   And so it could be really lifestyle-centric goals.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.700]   But it's something that you have figured out and accomplished
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.000]   with a halfway point along the way.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.900]   And if you're very overwhelmed, like you probably are now,
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.400]   again, they can be lifestyle-focused.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.800]   They can be pretty modest.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.100]   And as you emerge from the young kid period,
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.900]   as your kids go to elementary school,
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.700]   they're out of the house, the schedules are more routine,
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   then these can get back.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.100]   Maybe they're more professionally ambitious.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.900]   I mean, I certainly have in Project 40
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.500]   some way more professionally ambitious goals
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.800]   than I would have had for Project whatever
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.700]   that would have been when I was in your stage.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.600]   That would have been Project 38.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.100]   I was not thinking about then, let me get an HQ going.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.900]   Let me build out a media company.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.900]   I mean, it was survival.
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.400]   It was survival mode back then.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.700]   And now I'm in a different place.
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.500]   So good question, Nikki.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.700]   Introduce some annual goals back.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.500]   Do it carefully.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.900]   Have them be themed.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.400]   Have them be lifestyle-focused so
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.700]   that you feel really connected.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.900]   Like, accomplishing these is going to make my life better,
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.300]   our family's life better.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.500]   Have a halfway point for a more modest version of the goals.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.500]   And I think you'll get back some of that energy.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
