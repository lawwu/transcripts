[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.360]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, episode number 8.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.960]   In this episode, I'll be talking with Alan Roth.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.240]   Alan is a nationally known personal finance speaker,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.640]   writer, and the founder of WealthLogic,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.780]   an hourly-based investment advisor and financial planning
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.280]   firm.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:37.060]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.900]   Hello, everyone.
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.240]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host of Bogleheads
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.740]   on Investing, where each month I interview
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.940]   a new guest about different areas of personal finance.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.100]   My guest this month is Alan Roth,
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.980]   the founder of WealthLogic, an hourly-based investment
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.060]   advisor and financial planning firm.
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.180]   Alan is a nationally known writer and speaker
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.820]   on personal finance.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.460]   Over his career, he's been the chief financial officer
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.300]   of two multibillion-dollar corporations
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.220]   and consulted with many other corporations
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.300]   while at McKinsey & Company.
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.660]   He also taught investments and behavioral finance
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.460]   at the University of Denver, Colorado College,
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.540]   and the University of Colorado.
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.620]   Alan received his MBA from Northwestern University Kellogg
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.060]   School of Management.
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.980]   He is a CPA and a certified financial planner.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.620]   His book, How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street--
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.260]   Golden Rules Any Investor Can Learn, has been a bestseller.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.660]   He's also written for AARP, The Wall Street Journal,
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.500]   Financial Planning Magazine, and has appeared on numerous TV
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.940]   and radio shows.
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.940]   Alan's professional goal is never
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.500]   to be confused with Jim Cramer.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.740]   With no further ado, let's get Alan Roth on the line.
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.380]   Hi, Alan.
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.420]   How are you?
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.920]   Good.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.420]   Hi, Rick.
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.660]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.540]   I really appreciate you joining us on Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.260]   And today, we're going to talk about a couple of main topics.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260]   The first thing that we're going to talk about
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.980]   is the general advisor industry, which
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.700]   you've been in for a while.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.940]   The second thing we're going to talk
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.940]   about are individual questions about investments per se.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.100]   So we'll be talking about municipal bonds and insurance
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.700]   and so forth as an investment.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.100]   So let me go ahead and get into this.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.900]   There are so many people out there calling themselves
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.700]   financial advisors.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.260]   Could you tell us what a financial advisor is?
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.140]   Well, it's really easy to get licensed to call yourself
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.660]   a financial advisor.
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.060]   The Series 65 exam is not exactly rocket science.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.540]   It's even easier to get an insurance license
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.200]   where you can call yourself a financial advisor, financial
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.760]   planner.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.100]   But the quality of financial advice
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.580]   varies all over the map from purely sales-oriented
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.380]   to advice-only models.
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.580]   Well, I've got some data here that I want to go over with you
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.100]   because I think it's interesting.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.020]   There are really three basic broad categories of advisors.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.900]   And they would be the RIAs, or Registered Investment Advisors,
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.700]   brokers who work in the brokerage firms,
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.340]   and probably have a Series 7 exam, which
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.000]   is the brokerage exam.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.740]   And then there are insurance salespeople.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.540]   Would you agree that those are the three broad categories?
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.500]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.300]   That's a pretty good way to characterize it.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.140]   So let's now get into how many people fit in each category.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.260]   And I just looked up this data.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.460]   By far, the biggest category are the brokers.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.760]   And according to FINRA, in 2019, basically
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:58.260]   the end of February, there was 629,862 registered brokers
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.420]   who were working in 3,607 registered brokerage firms.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.020]   So that's a pretty big number.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.540]   By the way, that's down a little bit from 2007,
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.620]   down about 45,000 from 2007.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.900]   So we've lost brokers since the financial crisis.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.900]   Insurance salespeople, this was a little bit tougher.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.660]   And there might be some overlap here, too,
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.020]   because a lot of brokers have their insurance licenses.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.940]   But insurance sales representatives,
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:41.140]   489,880 insurance salespeople out there.
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.300]   Let's look at the investment advisor space.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.140]   These are the people who are doing assets
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.780]   under management or hourly.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.860]   And some of these might also be selling insurance.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.360]   And some of these might also be what
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.460]   we call dual-registered, which is brokers
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.540]   plus assets under management.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:03.220]   Anyway, the number of RIAs is 30,266.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.300]   8,000 of those are dual-registered
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.180]   as brokers and investment advisors, which
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.620]   leaves a little over 20,000 basically fee-only advisors who
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.500]   are just collecting fees.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.340]   So when I add up all of these and I
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.500]   take into consideration some overlap,
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.020]   it becomes a number of about 1 million people out there
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.340]   are calling themselves financial advisors.
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.580]   A lot of financial advisors out there.
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.980]   Like you said, there's overlap between the three.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.100]   You can be all three at once.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.620]   Two, you can't just assume that all brokers are evil
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.220]   and all RIAs are good.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.060]   I've seen some very good brokers sell some low-cost index fund
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.460]   portfolios.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.700]   And some so-called fiduciary RIAs, CFPs,
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.660]   sell product that--
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.500]   I'm not kidding-- had over a 5% annual fee.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.340]   Yeah, I've seen a lot of that, too.
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.800]   On the internet, you can find people
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.700]   that are charging just for a simple money-managed account
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.940]   1 and 1/2% per year, even up to-- somebody showed me one
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.740]   that was 2 and 1/2% per year.
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.740]   So it can be quite high.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.580]   And that doesn't include the cost of the funds themselves
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.260]   or whether or not these advisors are
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.860]   trying to do active management or trying
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.060]   to outperform the market.
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.980]   Yeah, there's this belief that fee-only means there's
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.420]   no conflicts of interest.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.820]   And let's face it, any time a dollar changes hands,
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.700]   including my hourly model, there are conflicts of interest.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.340]   And the best regulator out there is the consumer.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.100]   Make sure that you understand it.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.380]   Simplicity almost always trumps complexity,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.820]   with one exception being taxes.
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.220]   Yeah, let's get into the conflicts of interest.
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.700]   Let's start out with the commission model
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.020]   first, where an advisor is paid a commission
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.900]   to put their clients into certain products.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.940]   And depending on which product they put their client into,
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.980]   they'll get a higher fee or a higher commission
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.060]   or a lower fee or a lower commission.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.820]   Let's talk about commissions.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.740]   And what is the benefits of using
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.340]   an advisor who does commission?
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.180]   And what is the disadvantage of using
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.380]   advisors that do commission?
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.420]   Well, let me first say, as an hourly advisor,
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.900]   I've got bias on all of my answers.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.660]   So I want to just disclose that.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.260]   Commission, not only how much will
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.300]   they get paid in commission, but will they get that vacation
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.980]   at the Broadmoor Resort, or other things that are driving
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.660]   why they're selling what they're selling.
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.460]   So the pros are that typically it's a one-time fee.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.740]   And quite frankly, many times I see
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.660]   AUM charging more than people would be paying
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.540]   under a commission model.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.460]   But obviously, they sell what they're being paid to sell.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.940]   And it's the least transparent.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.220]   You can't find out how much the person is
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.940]   getting for selling that product.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.740]   The tax laws, recent tax law changes,
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.580]   have actually changed a few things.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.780]   If you're paying commission now, that actually
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.820]   comes out of the amount that you're paying for the product.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.260]   And so when you sell whatever it is you sell,
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.180]   you're not paying taxes on the commission part.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.900]   So it's actually a more tax-advantaged way
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.180]   of doing it.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.020]   Agreed.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.420]   I'll say it another way.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.180]   If you bought something like American Funds
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.980]   and you had a million dollars--
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.660]   I'm not advocating American Funds
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.100]   or not advocating American Funds.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.660]   But if you had a million dollars and you invested them
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.500]   through a broker in just American Funds,
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.420]   I believe that there's no commission
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.820]   to buy American Funds.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.580]   And the broker gets a quarter of a percent 12(b)(1) fee,
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.660]   which comes off the top on an annual basis.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.180]   Well, you're not paying taxes on that 0.25%.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.220]   So it comes out pre-tax, comes out of your returns.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.260]   You're absolutely right.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.380]   I totally agree with that.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.700]   The new tax law has made commissions more tax-efficient.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.340]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.460]   AUM advisors will complain profusely
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.140]   about anybody who gets a commission.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:17.380]   And yet, now the AUM fee is not as tax-efficient.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.460]   I agree with that.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.540]   Alan, let's go to the next way in which advisors get paid,
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.940]   which is percent of assets, where some people call
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.700]   this fee only.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.580]   And what are the benefits of paying an advisor
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.100]   for a percent of assets?
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.020]   And what is the disadvantage?
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.180]   Well, fee only includes assets under management,
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.100]   the ongoing percentage, and hourly as well.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.380]   But the AUM, in particular, the assets under management,
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.500]   you have $1 million.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.820]   I charge you 1%.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.180]   That's $10,000 a year.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.740]   The pros are that the advisor doesn't get paid
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.300]   to sell a particular product.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.820]   And there's far more transparency,
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.860]   because you can see what the advisor is taking out
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.460]   of your portfolio.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.180]   But you actually have to go and look.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.380]   Many people I speak to don't know how much they're
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.060]   paying on the AUM.
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.780]   The cons are that they're paid to capture your assets.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.500]   Are they really going to tell you to pay your mortgage down?
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.900]   And talking about the new tax law, the majority of people
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.180]   aren't getting a tax deduction on the entire amount
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.900]   of the interest they're paying on their mortgage.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.380]   So they're paid to capture assets.
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.340]   They're paid to overcomplicate things,
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.620]   because if the advisor gives you just a handful of funds
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.700]   and doesn't make changes on an ongoing basis,
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.740]   the client is going to say, why am I paying for it?
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.020]   So the cons are the overcomplication,
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.260]   capture assets, and constantly making changes.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.700]   I'm going to throw another one out there.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.940]   I think that doing a all-in fee, it's not quite a wrap fee,
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.500]   according to the SEC definition.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.660]   But when you add in financial planning
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.380]   to portfolio management and you're
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.460]   charging for financial planning based on the amount of money
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.180]   somebody has with you, the person who has $2 million
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.580]   is paying twice as much for financial planning
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.020]   as the person who has $1 million,
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.700]   but they're getting the same service.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.900]   Well, not only that, but oftentimes I'll
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.120]   have clients with-- they've just sold their business.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.420]   They've got tens of millions of dollars all in cash.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.580]   So that's a relatively simple plan to do.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.180]   At other times, I have people that
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.980]   come to me with $100,000 in three different annuities,
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.060]   and I can't help them on a cost-efficient basis.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.500]   So the amount of financial planning
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.740]   really isn't correlated all that well
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.020]   to the size of the portfolio.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.820]   And I agree.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.340]   So my view has been that you should
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.340]   pay for portfolio management some low fee,
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.660]   if that's what you want, ongoing portfolio management.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.900]   And everything other than that--
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.740]   financial planning, estate planning,
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.740]   some sort of tax planning, insurance planning,
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.060]   and everything else-- should be separate.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.740]   Should be a separate billing function
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.860]   based on the amount of time it takes to help a client.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.380]   That's my belief.
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.740]   Yeah, I totally agree with you.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.640]   The one exception would be, as a financial planner,
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.620]   I'm not licensed to do estate planning.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.060]   I'm not an attorney.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.020]   So I work with the client's attorney
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.540]   to make sure that my plan is consistent with their estate
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.340]   plan.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.780]   You don't do tax returns either, correct?
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.940]   I am a CPA.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.260]   But yes, I do not do tax returns.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.940]   So those two things would be outsourced.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.300]   Somebody else would do them.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.380]   Yeah, I am licensed.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.620]   Well, a lot of what I do is tax-related,
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.000]   is looking at what are the tax implications of moving
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.180]   the portfolio to something more tax-efficient, et cetera.
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.580]   What are the taxes that are going
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.780]   to have to be paid versus the benefits going forward?
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.160]   Let's go to the third model, which
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.100]   is hourly, which is also called advice only.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.540]   And that's what you've been doing for some time.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.740]   Personally, that's what I'm going to be doing starting now,
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.260]   launching my new firm.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.020]   And thank you for your help, by the way,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.500]   in giving me some guidance on how to do that.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:30.620]   But the hourly model, the benefits and the disadvantages.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.140]   Well, I obviously am very biased.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.980]   And I'm thrilled, by the way, that you're
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.580]   going into the hourly model.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.380]   I argue that every profession on Earth--
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.180]   sorry for this really bad joke, but even
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.660]   the oldest profession on Earth is fee for service.
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:49.340]   Did you come up with that?
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.580]   I think I did, but I'm not positive.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.100]   All right.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.900]   Giving advice and not having a way
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.180]   to profit from that advice, in my opinion,
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.660]   lowers, not eliminates, but lowers
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.220]   the conflicts of interest.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.440]   I can recommend any product anywhere,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.020]   paying down the mortgage, a CD at a particular bank
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.300]   with an easy early withdrawal penalty, et cetera.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.620]   So I love it from that respect.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.860]   Cons are there's still an incentive
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.540]   to overcomplicate to make sure that the client has
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.380]   some dependency.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.460]   The advisor can say, I think I know
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.020]   what sectors are going to outperform
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.260]   what the market's going to do.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.700]   So we need to meet quarterly, et cetera, to keep billing fees.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.820]   Many say that it's easy to pad hours,
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.180]   but I would argue that's just completely fraud.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.580]   So fraud can be done in any of the three models.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.380]   What else do you have for us?
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.060]   Well, again, anytime a dollar changes hands,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.020]   there's conflicts of interest.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.660]   So make sure that when you meet with the advisor,
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.100]   you understand what it is they're wanting to do.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.900]   You agree with it.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.260]   That it's simple, that you understand
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.540]   what the total fees are, that you can explain it
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.180]   to any eight-year-old.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.380]   Be your best regulator.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.380]   That's my advice.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.660]   One last thing I think is a pro to the hourly advice only
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.540]   model is that it's the most painful, and pain is good.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.100]   When I say painful, the client gets an invoice.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.100]   They have to make a payment right out of check,
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.820]   do a bill pay or something like that so they
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.060]   know what they're paying.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.100]   And that pain is a good thing, so they
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.420]   understand what they're paying.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.740]   Again, so many clients don't know
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.580]   what they're paying in the way of commission or even the AUM.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.820]   So transparency and pain is good.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.140]   Wouldn't that, though, prevent somebody from calling you
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.140]   if they really needed to?
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.100]   In other words, like a lawyer or someone,
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.540]   if you pick up the phone, every time I pick up the phone
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.420]   and call you, I know I'm going to have to pay something.
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.860]   So that might be a deterrent for me
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.340]   to actually call when I should.
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.500]   Absolutely, the same thing can happen
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.900]   if you're having a medical issue,
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.300]   but don't go to see the doctor.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.700]   So just have to make sure that the advice you're giving
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.820]   is worthwhile.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.260]   And my own particular model is my agreements
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.460]   give the client the right to cancel
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.540]   invoice on anything they don't think
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.940]   they've received value from.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.940]   The first time I met John Bogle roughly 16, 17 years ago,
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.100]   he told me a story that resonated with me.
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.380]   The advisor meets with the client,
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.700]   and the client wants a new portfolio.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:41.500]   The advisor designs the simple, low-cost, balanced portfolio,
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.500]   and the client goes away.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.660]   Next year, the client comes and says,
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.260]   will you take a look at my portfolio?
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:48.980]   What should I do?
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.340]   And the advisor says nothing.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.380]   The year after that, same thing happens.
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.300]   And a year after that, the client finally says,
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.220]   why am I paying you?
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.620]   You're telling me to do nothing.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.380]   And the advisor answers, to make sure you don't do something.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.660]   And that kind of resonated with me in my hourly model,
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.780]   that once you design the plan, sticking the plan
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.260]   and doing nothing is the right way to go.
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.820]   So what you're saying is that the advisors who
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.700]   are charging 1% and doing both money management
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.580]   and financial planning, the financial planning portion
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.780]   is really done in the first year.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.060]   Why are they continuing to charge 1% per year
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.500]   every single year after that?
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.220]   Exactly.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.300]   I want to ask a couple of questions about fees,
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.140]   because I've been doing a lot of debating on Twitter
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.820]   with other advisors about this 1% AUM fee.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.860]   And on average, when you look at all the data
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:51.940]   from various places, if a client has $1 million,
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:57.220]   the average AUM fee to manage that portfolio
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.740]   and provide some financial planning,
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.380]   or maybe not provide financial planning,
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.900]   just to manage the portfolio, is 1%.
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.540]   So a $1 million portfolio would be $10,000.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.900]   And I argue about this.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.820]   I say, well, why would you pay $10,000
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.020]   to have a portfolio managed?
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.500]   My gosh, you can go to Betterment,
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.940]   or you could go to Vanguard and have
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.860]   it managed with a professional for just a fraction of that.
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.300]   And the advisors who are charging 1% come back and say,
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.660]   well, we add value.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.740]   But what I don't understand, though,
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.540]   is how much does an actual financial plan cost?
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.540]   I look at some data from Michael Kitsis.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.820]   And he's got a very in-depth study
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.980]   about the cost of financial planning,
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.820]   how financial planners get paid.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.940]   And generally, he says that the typical financial plan
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.140]   runs anywhere between 10 and 20 hours, so call it 15.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.900]   And the typical financial planner
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.300]   gets paid, if you're going to break it down to an hourly
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.940]   basis, $200 to $250 an hour.
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.420]   So net-net, the average median financial,
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.540]   full-blown financial plan is around $3,500.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.460]   This is just a middle-of-the-road number.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.020]   And I know that it varies widely from one side to the other.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.740]   So the advisor who is charging a $2 million client, almost 1%,
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.580]   I'll just call it 0.9, is charging the client $18,000.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.020]   And if the financial plan costs $3,500,
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.060]   the client is paying $15,000 a year
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.060]   to have their $2 million portfolio managed,
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.340]   which to me, as a portfolio manager, a former,
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.020]   seems extremely high.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.860]   So I don't understand how the 1% AUM wrap fee, if you will,
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.100]   works out when the cost of financial planning--
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.700]   and it's usually just a one-time cost, correct?--
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.340]   is really not that high.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.940]   You just hit on something.
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.580]   It's a one-time cost.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.740]   So yeah, you're right.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:58.140]   I would guess my average plan is around 15 hours or so.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.700]   I'm more expensive than that $250.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.020]   But once the plan is done and we move towards simplicity,
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.900]   there's some pretty easy rules to give clients
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.380]   on how to manage their own portfolio.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:17.460]   And rarely do things change that much in one year.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.060]   Occasionally, somebody sells their business or something
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.660]   like that, and the plan needs to be updated.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.980]   But it's pretty much a one-time plan.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.940]   I tell all my clients, my goal is, after the engagement,
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.260]   is to be fired.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.340]   And I'm proud whenever the client, at the end of the plan,
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.700]   says, this is great.
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.340]   You're fired.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.500]   Plans can be simple or very complex,
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.060]   depending upon what situation the client is in.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.740]   But then once the plan is done, there's
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.020]   simple rules going forward.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.740]   Because I really know that I don't
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.940]   know what the market's going to do or anything like that.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.100]   If the market plunges and they want
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.740]   me to charge them an hour to tell them to stick to the plan
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.940]   and rebalance and buy now that stocks are on sale, I'll do it.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.380]   It's a lousy use of their money, but I would do it.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.340]   Not everybody can afford financial planning, right?
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.740]   I mean, if you've got a $1 million portfolio, $2 million,
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.300]   you probably can afford a financial plan.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.420]   But there are some alternatives now
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.420]   for people who don't have a lot of money.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.900]   Not only are there companies like Vanguard and Betterment
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.300]   and now Schwab charging relatively low fees,
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.420]   but there are hourly planners out there
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.660]   who will help people, correct?
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.740]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.540]   And probably the best group of hourly planners I know
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.780]   are Sheryl Garrett and the Garrett Planning Network,
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.220]   really try to help the middle market
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.220]   and are terrific advisors.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.340]   I'm not a member of the Garrett Network,
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.620]   but think very highly of Sheryl Garrett and her network.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.980]   I've known Sheryl for many years, and they do a great job.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.420]   Now, some of them do manage money, I understand.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.780]   But I think the focus of that organization is on hourly.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:09.700]   I know that if you're going to hire a financial planner,
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.260]   you need to really ask them, even
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.820]   if they're in the Garrett Network,
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.820]   you really need to ask them how you get paid
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.340]   and what their business model is.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.420]   No, absolutely.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.580]   No matter what model you're using,
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.780]   I think the most important question
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.940]   is, how much am I paying in total fees?
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.900]   Because you mentioned that 1% AUM.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.620]   Let's say they put you in other funds that have another,
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.380]   let's say, 0.5% in average fees.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.820]   And what really matters is one's real return, how much you're
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.060]   making after inflation.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.740]   So if, let's say, a balanced portfolio might beat inflation
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.460]   by 3%, if you're paying 1 and 1/2% in total fees,
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.500]   I don't care whether it's hourly commission, AUM, the fund
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.420]   fees, et cetera, you're giving away half of your real return,
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.380]   your real growth.
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.240]   I want to ask you about these robo-advisors.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.820]   I mentioned them a minute ago.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.100]   Oh, Betterment and Vanguard is sort of a robo-advisor.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.580]   And now Schwab is charging just a flat fee.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.120]   They just came out last week and said
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.980]   that their fee is going to be $30 a month for portfolio
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.860]   management and financial planning, basically
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.340]   unlimited financial planning.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.300]   Who do you think these services are designed for?
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.900]   I mean, how deep do they get on the financial planning
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.980]   side for the low fee?
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.540]   Well, any time fees go down, it's a wonderful thing.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.020]   And don't forget, Schwab has had the intelligent portfolio,
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.140]   the zero fee.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.780]   But of course, they have fees in other areas as well.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.780]   So any time fees go down, I think it is a wonderful thing.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.140]   In terms of the financial planning
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.740]   that they're giving, quite frankly,
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.820]   I don't know exactly what they're giving.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.180]   I know that there are some conflicts.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.180]   I've written even where I disagree with Vanguard on,
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.420]   again, paying down that mortgage and such.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.940]   So all advice has some bias.
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.260]   But a good financial plan at a low fee is a wonderful thing.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.220]   I'm a big fan of robo-advisors.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.100]   I think software can manage portfolios better than people.
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.820]   There's a lot of data to show that advisors
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:25.260]   were very heavily in stocks at the market high in '07
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.460]   and turned to cash at the market low in '09.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.220]   And software is going to do the opposite,
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.460]   is going to stick to the asset allocation and rebalance.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.620]   So I think it's absolutely a wonderful thing.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.380]   But it's also kind of a cookie cutter approach.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.700]   Rarely do I have a client come to me
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.420]   that doesn't have a portfolio already with huge tax
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.340]   ramifications of getting out.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.300]   So it doesn't fit into a cookie cutter sort of portfolio
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.460]   that robo-advisors typically use.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.460]   I agree with that.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.660]   If everything was tax-free, it would be easy.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.820]   And you could easily just move people around.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.100]   But the real problems are working around the tax issues.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:12.660]   I certainly could not turn my portfolio over to a robo-advisor
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:17.020]   because I would have huge tax ramifications for mistakes
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.940]   that I've made earlier on for the fact
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.020]   that there weren't total stock index funds when I started
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.420]   investing and the like.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.700]   So I've got a question, a little bit off topic.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.340]   But balanced funds seem to do a lot
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.100]   of the work of a robo-advisor, like Vanguard Life Strategy
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.220]   Funds or a Vanguard Balanced Index Fund.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.420]   And I know that iShares also--
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.900]   BlackRock also has iShares that are doing
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.100]   balanced-type investing.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.220]   What do you think of just using a balanced fund
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.580]   to do everything?
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.620]   Probably the best robo-advisor out there,
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.500]   if it's ultra-low fee-- again, the target date retirement
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.340]   funds, as long as they're very, very low cost,
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.980]   are great robo-advisors that do all of that for you.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.660]   The one thing you don't get is the asset location.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.700]   I've always argued that investing is simple.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.660]   I never argued that taxes were.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.420]   What I do for my clients are try to put certain assets,
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.140]   like fixed income things that are taxed at higher rates
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:23.180]   in the tax-deferred accounts, and very tax-efficient
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.260]   investments, like total stock index
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.740]   funds in the taxable accounts.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.460]   So you do lose that tax efficiency
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.900]   by going to a one-fund sort of solution with a target
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.180]   date or a balanced fund.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.220]   But there are tax-efficient balanced funds.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.020]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:44.140]   They're not putting the assets in the right tax wrapper.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.260]   They may not generate as much in the way of taxes.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.820]   But the fixed income for clients that
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.580]   are in a high-income bracket, that's
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.340]   much better located in the tax-deferred account.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.620]   Because if you have stocks in the tax-deferred accounts, what
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.540]   you're doing is eventually creating
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.780]   what would have been a long-term capital gain.
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.620]   And you can defer that on a tax index fund.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.020]   You're in control of the capital gain.
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.900]   So you're converting it to ordinary income
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.820]   when you have to start taking it out, either to live on
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:17.140]   or for the required minimum distributions.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.020]   Got it.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.700]   Ellen, I was at an ETF conference about a month ago.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.580]   And the big thing that they started talking about there
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.020]   was this thing called direct indexing.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:35.140]   And what direct indexing is, is you give a money manager--
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.860]   call it a million dollars.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:41.020]   And they buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.980]   with that million dollars in fractional shares.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.300]   Or they might do some sampling and buy 250 stocks.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.340]   And then they'll selectively sell off individual stocks
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.540]   when there is a loss to generate a tax loss.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.540]   And then they might replace that with another stock that
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.420]   is not part of the 250.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.580]   Or they might wait 30 days and rebuy the stock
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.740]   and avoid tax wars rules.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.260]   Whatever their particular strategy is.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:13.860]   But the idea is that you can generate a lot of tax losses.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:19.060]   And if you happen to have a big taxable gain in a low-cost base
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.580]   of security or some other reason that's
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.260]   going to give you a big tax gain,
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.740]   this is a way of offsetting some of those taxes.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.860]   I look at it skeptically.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.820]   But what are your views on direct indexing?
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.220]   Wealthfront was the first robo-advisor
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.740]   that I saw doing it.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:37.780]   And I wrote about it.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.860]   And I think that it's a wonderful thing.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:46.260]   But the tax alpha, as they call it, is really overstated.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.860]   So what happens, assuming that the market moves up
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.740]   over the long run, the amount of tax losses generated
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.300]   go down year after year after year.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.700]   And there's very little tax gain going forward.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.460]   But the problem with this is that the fees stay forever.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.940]   The complexities stay forever.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.460]   But the tax benefit goes down.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.260]   And don't forget, the tax benefit is just a deferral.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.020]   Because if you eventually sell them,
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.620]   you're going to have to pay that very large capital gain.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.300]   Because you're left with the stocks that
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.540]   had the biggest winners.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.980]   So it is good.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.620]   I am for it.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.820]   I typically will have a client do that if, let's say,
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.780]   they want to donate some money a few years from now
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.420]   to a charity, to a donor-advised fund.
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.540]   So they could put $100,000, $200,000 in there,
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.980]   get the tax losses, be left with some stocks that
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.660]   have very large gains, and then donate it to a charity.
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.940]   The other option is they can always just take over
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.380]   the several hundred stocks that are left in the direct indexing
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.340]   and stop the fees.
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.580]   But then you're left with the complexity of a portfolio
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.340]   with hundreds of stocks.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.140]   Over time, you don't have the tax losses to use.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.100]   But you're left with all these stocks.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.460]   And you have to pay fees on it if you want somebody
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.180]   to continue to manage it.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.500]   I was talking with some people in the industry, though.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:17.540]   Maybe there's a way to take those 250 to 500 stocks
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.900]   and convert it to ETF shares.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.460]   Hasn't happened yet.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.940]   But I'm talking with various people in the industry.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.740]   And it sure would be great if you
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.260]   could take those 250 to 500 individual stocks,
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.700]   turn them into State Street, or Vanguard, or someone,
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.940]   and get issued shares of an ETF, of an S&P 500 fund.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.540]   The cost basis of your shares would
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:48.500]   be the aggregate cost basis of the stocks that you have.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:52.220]   But at least it could make it easier and make it more--
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.420]   you'd only have one security now instead of 250 to 500.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.980]   And the IRS isn't missing out on anything here.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.980]   So maybe, perhaps, somebody will figure out how to do that.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.020]   And to me, it would make this direct indexing a little bit
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.060]   more palatable than currently what
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.180]   happens at the end of it all.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.660]   I'd be a little surprised.
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.100]   I hadn't heard of that, by the way.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.740]   But if I'm left with 280 stocks, I
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.900]   don't think the IRS is going to let me convert that to something
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.060]   that has all 500 without paying taxes on it.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.380]   That would be my hunch.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.220]   But I had not heard of that idea before.
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.180]   Yeah, it's just an idea.
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.140]   And it's just, again, you're not getting away
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.140]   with not paying taxes because your cost
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.860]   basis on the ETF shares that you were issued
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.380]   would be the total aggregate cost basis of the stocks
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.620]   that you currently held.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:45.580]   So I've talked with numerous people in the industry
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.340]   about this idea.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.260]   I think if that actually occurred,
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.760]   if you were able to actually do that
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.020]   at the end of this direct indexing,
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.380]   then it would make that whole concept much more popular.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.980]   And I think it would be a trillion-dollar industry.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.540]   But again, that was just an idea.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.380]   And it's not there yet.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.220]   So before we move on to the next topic,
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.500]   you are an hourly advisor.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.220]   I have become an hourly advisor.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.180]   So I can guess that's a trend of at least one.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:16.580]   Do you think that this hourly model will continue to grow?
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.740]   Or do you think that the AUM model will continue to grow?
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.940]   Or maybe some other model like retainers or subscription-based
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.580]   is another model that might grow.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.300]   What do you think the advisor industry and fees are going?
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.100]   Roughly, I think it was a year and a half, two years ago,
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.200]   I interviewed Bill McNabb when he was CEO of Vanguard.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.380]   I asked him the question, will hourly take over?
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.020]   And I agree with his answer that it won't.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:44.700]   It took a long, long time for people
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.580]   to move from the commission model
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:50.460]   to the more popular AUM model now,
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.660]   which is growing in popularity.
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.860]   And it would be a very long time before hourly would take over.
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.700]   I also think that people like paying
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.580]   in a painless sort of way.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.340]   And the AUM model is a whole lot less painful
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.120]   than the hourly model.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.380]   So yeah, I don't think that the hourly--
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.500]   I think it's going to gain in traction.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.900]   But I think it will be the minority model for probably
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.220]   the rest of my life.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.820]   What do you think about subscription-based, which
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.420]   is another way of billing?
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.220]   You've got financial planners out there
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.820]   that are charging between, let's say, $150 to $300 per month.
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.620]   You think it's good, that the problem that I have with that
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.860]   is the complexities vary all over the map.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.500]   And it's the same sort of thing, that a good financial plan
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.940]   is lasting with rules going forward and not
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.180]   the need to keep paying.
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.580]   Let me ask you a question, and I'll
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.140]   get back to something I asked before,
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.500]   about the difference between managing money, an advisor who
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.820]   is managing money, and advisors who
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.100]   are doing just financial planning, or just advice,
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.780]   and then there are the ones who do both.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:03.940]   What is your view of a fair fee for just the money management
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:08.780]   side, the percentage of the population who are delegators?
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.540]   They don't want to manage their own portfolios.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.060]   They want somebody else to do the tax loss harvesting,
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.240]   do the tax management.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.240]   They want to be able to call somebody up and say,
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.980]   send me a check for $10,000, or whatever.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.020]   Do the tax allocation, and maintain the portfolios.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:29.860]   What do you think a fair fee is for the advisor who's
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.300]   going to do that?
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.860]   I'd say no more than 0.3%, which is
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.380]   what Vanguard charges on their personal advisory services.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.380]   Yes, if somebody doesn't want to think about it,
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:43.380]   doesn't want to do anything, then, yeah,
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.580]   an hourly planner is not the right choice,
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.460]   and an AUM planner is the better choice.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.780]   And again, keeping fees ultra low,
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.820]   either through a robo-advisor that
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.700]   has the financial planning built in,
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.100]   or a Vanguard personal advisory service,
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.140]   which is a hybrid robo-model, I would argue.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.740]   Fees have to stay very, very low.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.460]   A lot of advisors, I think, kind of
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:16.620]   take shortcuts when trying to get people to invest with them.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.220]   And I was in the advisory business for 30 years now,
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.020]   10 years as a broker, and then 20 years
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.380]   with an AUM company that managed investment portfolios,
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.980]   and only now I'm going into hourly
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.260]   because they don't have that company anymore.
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.660]   A lot of advisors use these risk tolerance questionnaires
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.500]   and Monte Carlo simulation models.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.340]   And a lot of these things that make
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.460]   it sound so sophisticated and scientific as to how
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.980]   they go about creating a portfolio
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.540]   and managing that portfolio.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.180]   What do you think about all of these questionnaires
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.500]   and Monte Carlo simulation?
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.940]   I've written a couple of pieces.
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:00.580]   You know, the risk of taking risk profile questionnaires.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.620]   You know, did Monte Carlo simulations fail?
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:08.660]   And first of all, on the questionnaires,
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.420]   typically when I take one, I get that I
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:16.900]   should be somewhere between 70% and 90% in stocks.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.020]   And what they're doing is measuring my willingness
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.940]   to take risk at that moment.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.900]   And after 10 years of a bull market,
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:29.620]   we all think we have a very high willingness to take risk.
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:33.060]   And then stocks plunge, and suddenly that willingness
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.660]   to take risk goes away.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.020]   And the second, the biggest problem with these things
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.580]   is they don't measure one's need to take risk.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.780]   You know, as our friend William Bernstein puts it,
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.420]   when you've won the game, quit playing.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:51.060]   That doesn't mean 0% stocks, but take risk off the table
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.740]   so that they don't measure that.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:58.260]   So in spite of being told I should be 70% to 90% in stocks,
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.980]   I'm 45% in stocks and not about to change.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.220]   Regarding Monte Carlo simulation,
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.660]   I'm a big believer in Monte Carlo simulation, which
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.940]   actually came from a firm, McKinsey and Company,
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.740]   that I worked for a couple of decades or so ago.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.620]   But the problem with Monte Carlo simulation are assumptions.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.420]   And by the way, a Monte Carlo simulation
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.940]   is a model that runs 1,000 or more iterations of what
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.740]   asset classes might do and calculates the probability
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.260]   that you'll have enough to live out in retirement.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.260]   Like any model that happens to be good--
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.300]   and I argue Monte Carlo simulation did not
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.300]   fail in 2008, 2009.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.580]   It was the assumptions that went into the Monte Carlo simulation
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.660]   of incredibly high returns, very low volatility,
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.780]   because the planner's going to know when to get out
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.060]   of the market, and all sorts of false assumptions
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.860]   that went in there.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.260]   So Monte Carlo simulations are good,
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:00.060]   but the assumptions have to be very real.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.180]   I don't use questionnaires either.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.260]   And a lot of these canned programs
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.460]   that financial planners use that have Monte Carlo simulations
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.940]   in it have a lot of garbage going in on the inside.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.620]   They really do.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.700]   So the advisor really needs to understand
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.100]   the dynamics of Monte Carlo simulation
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.980]   and make their own assumptions and make them realistic
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.980]   on the front end so they can get something useful
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.660]   on the back end.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.420]   But I don't think that occurs 9 out of 10 times.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.540]   Yeah, probably 99 out of 100.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.580]   Yeah, I've looked at several different financial planning
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.940]   pieces of software and ultimately decide
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.460]   I'm doing my own financial planning
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.300]   and not using any of their software.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.620]   I want to now turn to some investment questions that
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:46.180]   were posed on the Bogleheads forum specifically for you,
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.300]   because you've had written about and talked
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.220]   about various asset classes.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.380]   And I want to go over some of those asset classes
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.180]   or investments with you.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:01.260]   And you could give us your current views.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.700]   Let's start with municipal bonds.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:08.700]   What are your views on the state of the municipal bond market?
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.820]   And if someone was to be a municipal bond investor,
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.900]   what would you recommend?
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:20.780]   Yeah, first of all, never buy the muni bonds directly.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.940]   The bid-ask spreads of muni bonds
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.860]   can easily be in the 1% to 3% category.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:31.700]   The largest spread I've ever seen was 10.25%.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.300]   And my client, by the way, happened
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.540]   to be an attorney with the Securities and Exchange
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.820]   Commission in Washington, DC.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.900]   Had no clue about that.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.180]   And then on individual muni bonds,
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.180]   even in Vanguard statements, if you look at the yield,
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.540]   that yield includes the amortization of premium,
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:53.380]   which is really paying back your own principal.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.500]   So if you're going to buy a muni bond,
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.180]   I would buy an ultra-low-cost muni bond fund,
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:02.820]   like the Vanguard Intermediate Term Tax Exempt Fund.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.700]   With that said, I own a little bit of it.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:11.060]   I do not let my clients put more than 20% of their fixed income
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.580]   in that fund.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.900]   And the reason is that even after a 10-year bull stock
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.260]   market, municipalities and states,
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.820]   their pensions still have, according to Moody's, $1.6
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:27.500]   trillion worth of unfunded pension liabilities.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.180]   And there are actuarial assumptions
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:36.700]   with about a 7%, 7.5% return, which I think are aggressive.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:42.220]   So that if stocks don't do very well over the next decade,
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:46.380]   and especially if stocks decline over the next decade
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.300]   as baby boomers retire, there's going
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.380]   to be a lot of stress on those municipalities.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.100]   And there could be some systemic defaults,
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.660]   a new correlation to stocks that had never happened before.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:04.660]   So I'm OK with low-cost muni bond funds to a limited degree.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:08.100]   Munis represent about 10% of investment-grade bonds.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.820]   And I don't let my clients go more than twice
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.060]   that allocation to 20%.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.780]   OK, next question.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.400]   International bonds and international bond funds,
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.980]   what are your current views on adding these to a portfolio?
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.680]   I think they're OK.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.260]   I generally don't recommend them.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.100]   I own a tiny little bit myself.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:30.580]   When Vanguard launched its international bond fund,
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.940]   they asked me to write about it.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.020]   I did, and I kind of gave it a ho-hum recommendation.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.340]   First of all, never buy an expensive international fund,
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:42.460]   and never buy an unhedged international bond fund.
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.260]   An unhedged international bond fund
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:48.540]   is going to behave very much like a foreign currency fund.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.700]   But the problem with the Vanguard fund,
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:54.240]   although it's very good and it's the best international bond
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.340]   fund out there, is it's A, more expensive,
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.060]   and B, it doesn't include the cost of the currency hedging.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:05.000]   And I understand their argument that international bonds
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.540]   are the single largest of the four categories--
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.180]   US stocks, international stocks, US bonds, international bonds.
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.140]   And I'm a believer in diversification.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.660]   But let's face it.
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.620]   If the US government goes out of business
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.620]   and the US government issues the vast majority
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.620]   of the investment-grade bonds, then all of our portfolios
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.460]   will fail.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.460]   So I think there's less importance there.
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:30.260]   But if somebody wants the international bond fund,
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.140]   the Vanguard one, I'm fine with them keeping it or buying some.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.260]   I think you and I have similar views on the fund.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.680]   It's like, if you already have it or if you want it, fine.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.140]   But it's not something I would recommend in a portfolio.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.140]   But if you have it or you want it, it's OK.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.480]   Next question, and this is going to be your favorite one,
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.100]   I think--
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.060]   equity index annuities.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.180]   You're a big fan, I hear.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:52.780]   Oh, yes.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.420]   Yes, all the upside of the market, no downside risk.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.660]   Yeah, I've written about these extensively.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.060]   And you have to give them the smell test.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.580]   How can somebody give you the upside of the market,
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.940]   no downside risk?
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.620]   You reverse engineer it.
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:12.220]   You look at the portfolio of the insurance company offering it.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:17.140]   And you can see that they're 80% to 90% in bonds.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:21.460]   And 10% to 20% in stocks, in real estate, other investments
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.020]   that you could have bought directly.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:27.060]   So what you're doing is buying the portfolio indirectly,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:32.500]   paying the agent who's making 10% when you buy the product,
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.740]   making money for the insurance company,
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.100]   covering their overheads, et cetera.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.420]   It's not going to deliver what it says.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.900]   There are all sorts of tricks.
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.740]   Caps, the S&P 500 index, strip of dividends.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.060]   The one I just saw was sold at a much higher rate.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.560]   But they had subsequently, after the client bought it,
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:55.220]   lowered the maximum return to 4%.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.940]   So they're going to earn somewhere between 0% and 4%.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.980]   The money is locked up.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.380]   They're going to get less than what they could have gotten
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.460]   on buying a treasury fund.
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.980]   Not a good deal.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.380]   So basically what you're saying, it
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:13.780]   doesn't pass what you call your reasonableness test.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.820]   What is your reasonableness test?
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.900]   It's reverse engineering.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.860]   I call it the smell test.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.500]   How are they going to deliver what they're promising to you?
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.300]   How do they make money off of it?
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.460]   How can they own a mostly bond and a little stock portfolio
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.900]   and give you all the upside of the market, no downside risk?
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.940]   Reverse engineer it.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:35.900]   What's in it for them?
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.260]   They're not doing it because they're
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.660]   charitable organizations trying to make you rich.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:46.500]   It's like the call that you get trying to sell you the oil well
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.500]   partnership that has never had a dry well in their 20 years.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.920]   Why the heck are they calling you?
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.620]   Why wouldn't their current investors want to be getting in?
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.940]   Common sense is not all that common.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.860]   The last thing about the smell test is, not always,
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.460]   but roughly 99% of the time that I've
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.700]   heard something that just sounds too good to be true,
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.460]   it usually is.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:13.940]   But not all insurance type products for investing are bad.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.300]   Let's take a single premium immediate annuity.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.660]   There's been a lot of good things
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.220]   written about some people using those.
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.540]   Would you agree?
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:28.220]   Yeah, I think it's certainly the best of all the insurance
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.340]   company annuities.
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:33.140]   That's when, let's say, you pay a million dollars
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:36.420]   and the insurance company turns around
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:40.740]   and they say they're paying you $60,000 a year in income
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.780]   for the rest of your life.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.340]   So it's not a bad product, but it's not income,
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.260]   if you think about it.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.500]   If you do the math, that million dollar $60,000 example,
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.540]   it's not income because you have to live over 16 years just
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.780]   to get your principal back.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:01.260]   Number two, it typically doesn't have an inflation adjustment.
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.660]   There's only one company that I know of that does,
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.700]   and that's Principal.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.500]   And of course, that really lowers the amount
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.420]   that you get paid.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.380]   So if you're doing a SPIA that pays a flat amount,
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:18.100]   you're getting less and less spending power every year.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.580]   But it's certainly not a horrible investment.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.020]   And two annuities I often recommend
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.260]   are, number one, delaying Social Security.
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.980]   That's the best deferred annuity on the planet
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:33.020]   because it's a government-sponsored,
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.660]   inflation-adjusted annuity.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.740]   And then second, roughly 75% of the time
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.220]   I do an analysis of somebody that
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.260]   is retiring with a pension, it comes out
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:49.220]   better to take the payment than to take the lump sum
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.060]   and roll it over to the IRA.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.420]   And when you think about both of those examples,
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.380]   no commissions are being paid.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.980]   No insurance company is making a profit
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.580]   and covering their overhead.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.300]   So those are probably the best two annuities on the planet.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.140]   Good answer, Alan.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.660]   Thanks.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.540]   And by the way, I did interview Mike Piper, as you know,
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.060]   for Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:13.500]   And he talked all about the benefits
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.620]   of delaying Social Security.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.740]   That was a great podcast.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:21.180]   Alan, I had one Boglehead who is in the Thrift Savings
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:25.700]   Plan, which is the government plan for like a 401(k)
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:29.140]   for government employees in the military.
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.860]   He's going to be retiring soon and wants
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:33.500]   to know your thoughts about leaving the money in the plan
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:37.460]   rather than taking it out or rolling it into an IRA.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:42.180]   Well, let me say I've been on federal news radio many times.
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.700]   And once I joked, will somebody hire me
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.860]   into a government agency, pay me $1,
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:52.900]   give me enough time to roll my IRAs into the Thrift Savings
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.740]   Plan, and then you can fire me?
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:55.940]   It is that good.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.220]   I wish I had access to the Thrift Savings Plan.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.020]   I love the simplicity.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.980]   I love the ultra-low costs.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:07.500]   But really what I love the most is the G Fund.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.540]   That's a bond issued by the Treasury
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.900]   only for US government employees.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:19.340]   And what it does is gives you an intermediate term bond rate
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.060]   without the downside if interest rates go up.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.380]   It's a stable value sort of thing.
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.740]   And because a tax-deferred account
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.060]   is the perfect place to hold bonds,
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.340]   and that's a superior bond, I love it.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.660]   I wish I had access to it.
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.820]   So hopefully that answers the question,
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:39.900]   don't take your money out.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:40.660]   Probably does.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.940]   And I always wondered why other governments don't
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:49.460]   copy the Thrift Savings Plan with their own 403(b) plans.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:51.300]   I mean, the 403(b) plans, I've seen
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.540]   some of the most horrible investment choices,
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.980]   such high cost.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:58.380]   I wish some of these trustees on these 403(b) plans
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.820]   for medical professionals and for teachers
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.740]   would just look at the federal government's Thrift Savings
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:09.580]   Plan and copy it and save their participants ungodly amounts
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.260]   of money over time.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:15.460]   Well, when I help a client's company set up a 401(k)
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.860]   or move a 401(k), I try to design it
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.420]   after the Thrift Savings Plan.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.980]   But I don't have access to a G Fund type of security.
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:24.780]   OK, got it.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.740]   I've got a question now from a Boglehead
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.220]   who has been listening to you and reading your stuff
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.220]   and thinks you're great.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.740]   And he wants to get into the industry.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.180]   So if somebody out there decides they
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.860]   want to do the right thing for clients,
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.780]   and they like what they're hearing on these podcasts,
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.420]   they like what you're saying, and they
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:49.740]   want to get into the industry, would you
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.660]   recommend they do that?
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.260]   What advice would you give somebody
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.460]   who makes a kind of a mid-career change
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:02.460]   to get into the financial advisory industry?
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.580]   That's a tough question.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.300]   I got into the hourly business only
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:10.940]   after a couple of decades of corporate finance
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.500]   and living frugally.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:16.260]   So I didn't need to make a whole lot of money my first year.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.660]   And my first year, by the way, my total revenue was $500.
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:23.540]   So probably, if they've got a family, kids to send
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.220]   to college, et cetera, the best advice
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:31.820]   is to go to work for an AUM financial advisor,
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.540]   kind of learn the business, and then
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.460]   decide whether or not they want to go out on their own.
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.020]   As you know, I'm an advocate of the hourly model.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.180]   But it's very hard for somebody who
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:45.100]   needs to make a living to just start a practice
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.620]   on the hourly model.
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.220]   I started in the brokerage world for 10 years
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.780]   to learn the business.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.540]   And that's where I received my CFA charter
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:58.460]   and ended up getting my master's of science and finance.
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.540]   And then I left after 10 years of learning the industry
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.980]   and getting my education to go out and start
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:07.100]   my own company managing money.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.600]   And after that, for 20 years now,
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.220]   I'm going out and doing hourly.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.860]   So I agree with you that doing hourly
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.500]   is very difficult if you're just going to go out of the block,
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.300]   just getting in the industry and doing hourly.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.980]   That doing something else to get some experience
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:23.780]   is generally going to be helpful.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.620]   Yeah, incentives matter, by the way.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:28.740]   If paying my kids college tuition
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.380]   were dependent upon me selling you
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:34.180]   that annuity in your IRA with all the upside of the market,
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.020]   no downside risk, I would do it.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.640]   I would think I'm a force for good.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:42.700]   And I would think that you and Alan just don't understand it.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.620]   You'll be sorry when stocks plunge.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.820]   Alan, let me ask you one final question.
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.660]   Could you give us your list of what investors
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:55.500]   should be looking for when they go to hire an advisor?
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.220]   Meet with the advisor.
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.580]   See what it is they're offering to do for you.
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:04.100]   If they're telling you they're going to beat the market, run.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.620]   But meet with the advisor.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.060]   Listen to him or her, what they're saying.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:12.300]   Are they trying to move you from complexity to simplicity?
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.020]   That's a good thing.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.820]   A good advisor can help you build the right asset
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:20.340]   allocation for the amount of risk that you want to take.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:24.100]   They can help you maximize that diversification,
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.580]   minimize the fees.
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.020]   They can provide discipline to stay the course.
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:32.540]   And as I think I mentioned, advisors as a whole,
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:37.740]   time markets probably as poorly as individuals, if not worse.
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:39.520]   I've always said that investing is simple.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.900]   I never said tax is worse.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:44.380]   So maximize that tax efficiency.
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:48.580]   Help you on retirement planning, which assets to spend first.
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:50.940]   Quite frankly, in retirement, if you
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:53.660]   delay social security, which is typically
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:57.660]   the thing to do in Mike Piper's open social security
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.940]   calculator, is absolutely wonderful.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.700]   And they can sell stocks with a long-term capital gain
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:06.020]   at a 0% tax rate, things like that.
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:10.300]   Help them understand risk management.
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.580]   A good advisor needs to argue with you
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:15.700]   and push back when they don't agree with you.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.700]   So those are things that a good advisor can do.
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.120]   So meet with the advisor.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.660]   See what it is they're suggesting to do.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.620]   And then always ask, what are the total fees
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.300]   that I'll be paying?
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.940]   And just one last thing.
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:31.660]   The advisor you're thinking of hiring
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.940]   needs to be willing to be the bad guy,
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:37.020]   to help get you out of where you are.
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:41.500]   Because sometimes firms don't like losing money.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.500]   And there needs to be a lot of pushback
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:48.700]   to get them to move forward.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.500]   That's great advice, Alan.
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.980]   Thank you for being on Bogleheads on investing today.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.940]   We really appreciate you giving us your insights.
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.540]   It's been a wonderful talk.

[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.580]   Thank you, Rick.
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:02.420]   This concludes the eighth episode
