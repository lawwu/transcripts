[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   Welcome back. This new week on the podcast starts off by wrapping up a bundle of recent
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.760]   apologetics questions on the person and work of Christ. We recently looked at six reasons
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.720]   why Jesus had to leave earth after Easter. Imagine life on earth if Christ was still
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.040]   here with us. He's not. Why not? That was APJ 1978. Then we looked at why didn't Jesus
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.000]   have to pay eternally for our sins? Isn't that the cost? Eternal judgment. So why was
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.640]   his suffering cut so short? That was APJ 1979. And then we looked at even if the Christian
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.320]   faith is untrue, if the cross and resurrection didn't happen, aren't Christians still happier
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.360]   than non-Christians in this life? Don't our present life priorities make for a more fulfilling
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.000]   experience of this life than the non-Christians seeking their joy in this world, even if we're
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.880]   still here? That was APJ 1977. And related to that one comes today's question. Why don't
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.040]   we have more artifacts, more archaeology, or even a more diversified record of historical
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.840]   documents to corroborate the death and resurrection of Christ? Shouldn't we have more? The question
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.760]   is from a listener named Terry. Pastor John, hello to you. My question for you is why in
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.840]   this age it remains so easy for non-believers to refute the crucifixion and resurrection
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.760]   of Jesus? If God controls everything, why is the existence of Jesus and his crucifixion
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.840]   not made more undeniable? People can so easily say that the events of the Bible are not real.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.160]   Why did God not orchestrate it so that there were more witnesses, more archaeological evidence,
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.200]   more handwritten accounts? Why did he seem to leave so much room for doubt? Pastor John,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.320]   how would you respond to Terry? I have two main responses to this question.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:07.000]   The first is that historically speaking, the text of the New Testament, the Greek text
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.880]   of the New Testament, which is the written accounts of first century witnesses to Christ,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:22.840]   is spectacularly reliable. That's number one. I'll come back to it and explain why in a
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:32.360]   minute. Second, the obstacles that hinder warranted belief, justifiable belief in the
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.520]   truth of those first century testimonies are the same obstacles that people experienced
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.960]   who were looking Jesus right in the face and did not believe in spite of all his signs.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:59.120]   In other words, the root problem today and then is not and was not absence of evidence.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.360]   Now, why do I say that the New Testament accounts of the first century Christian witnesses are
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:17.160]   spectacularly reliable? Terry asks, why did God not provide more handwritten accounts?
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:28.080]   I wonder if people who ask that have any idea what they are saying. Caesar's Gallic Wars
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:39.880]   was written about 50 BC and there are 10 surviving manuscripts. Livy's History of Rome has 20
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:49.600]   surviving manuscripts. Tacitus' Histories and Annals, written about 100 AD, has two
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.920]   manuscripts. Thucydides' History, which was written about 400 BC, has eight manuscripts.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.440]   Most scholars of such sources go about their work with confidence that they are in touch
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.520]   with the original witnesses. Now, according to the Institute of New Testament Textual
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:17.920]   Research in MÃ¼nster, Germany, there are 5,800 manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts of
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:30.120]   the New Testament. Not two, not 10, not 20, not eight. It is a spectacular wealth of handwritten
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:38.240]   accounts of what was originally written and hundreds of them are older than anything we
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.280]   have for those secular histories. The science of textual criticism that handles these thousands
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:53.560]   of manuscripts is able to compare those manuscripts and determine with astonishing accuracy what
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.600]   the original manuscripts actually said. Here's F.F. Bruce. He was from the previous generation.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.880]   He was alive when I was studying as a seminary student. He wrote this, "If the great number
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:14.200]   of manuscripts increases the number of scribal errors," copying errors as you go from one
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.760]   copy to the next, "it increases proportionately the means of correcting such errors so that
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:29.920]   the margin of doubt left in the process of recovering the exact original wording is in
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:37.800]   truth remarkably small." Now, that comes from the New Testament documents. Are they reliable?
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.840]   Which you can still get at Amazon. I recommend it. I also recommend Paul Wegner, a student's
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.320]   guide to textual criticism of the Bible, and Craig Blumberg, the historical reliability
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:58.520]   of the Gospels. The remarkable fact is that most historical scholars today, liberal or
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:06.360]   conservative, believe that the Greek texts that we have in the New Testament are really
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:15.200]   what the authors wrote near the time when the events actually happened, which also means,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:23.160]   for example, that when your Muslim friends tell you that the New Testament we have is
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.280]   not the New Testament that was originally written, but a much later creation of the
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:38.280]   church, you need to know there is zero, I'm talking zero, historical evidence for that
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.960]   claim, that there's an existing New Testament that we don't have that was before our New
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.680]   Testament. They are not making a historically justifiable statement. It is demanded by their
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.200]   faith, not by historical evidence, because they don't want anyone to think Jesus was
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:05.560]   actually crucified. But in fact, the crucifixion of Jesus is one of the most historically certain
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:14.000]   events of the first century. The view that it didn't happen is highly eccentric from
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.800]   a historical standpoint. So let me turn now to my second response, which I think is probably
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:29.200]   existentially the most significant part of Terry's question. The obstacles that hinder
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:37.440]   justified belief in the truth of these testimonies today is the same set of obstacles that people
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.920]   experienced who were looking at Jesus in his own day, right in the face, flesh to flesh,
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:52.120]   eye to eye, and did not believe. In other words, the root problem is not the absence
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:58.600]   of evidence. You remember the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16. The rich
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:07.120]   man and the poor man, Lazarus, died. Lazarus went to heaven, Abraham's bosom, and the rich
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:16.240]   man went to torment. And in the torment, he says across this chasm to Abraham, "I beg
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.640]   you, send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brothers, so that he may warn
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:30.000]   them lest they also come into this place of torment." And Abraham said, "They have Moses
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.580]   and the prophets. Let them hear them." And he said, "No, Father Abraham, but if someone
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:42.360]   goes to them from the dead," in other words, if there's enough evidence, if there's a sign,
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:50.840]   they will repent. And Abraham said to him, "If they do not hear Moses and the prophets,
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.600]   neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead." Now, that's amazing.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:05.640]   What it means is that the same inner condition of heart that keeps a person from believing
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:13.060]   the Old Testament prophets also keeps them from submitting to the evidence of actually
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:20.640]   seeing someone rise from the dead. That was true then, and it's true today. You remember
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.840]   the other Lazarus, remember? There are two Lazaruses in the New Testament. Jesus raised
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.020]   this Lazarus from the dead. He was dead four days, and Jesus raised him from the dead to
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:38.540]   give a sign that people would believe and glorify God. And when that miracle happened,
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:46.320]   some believed. In fact, it says many believed in John 11. But others went and told the Pharisees,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:53.040]   and their response was they plotted to kill Jesus, and they plotted to kill Lazarus to
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:01.960]   get rid of the evidence. More than once, people demanded a sign from Jesus, even after he
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:09.840]   had done so many compelling signs already. And here's what Jesus said to them in John
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.380]   10, 24. The Jews gathered around him and said, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:23.520]   you are the Christ, tell us plainly." And Jesus said to them, "I told you, and you don't
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:31.200]   believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me, but you do not
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:38.600]   believe because you are not among my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:49.000]   they follow me." Here's what Jesus said to explain that, how a person could come to see
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:58.980]   Jesus as true. He said in John 7, 17, "If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:08.900]   know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority." The problem
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:19.120]   of unbelief is not mainly a lack of evidence, but a deep heart resistance to God and his
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:30.460]   will. Changing that heart condition is a great work of God. We are utterly dependent on it
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:39.320]   in our evangelism. So let's not be deterred in our evangelism by anyone who says, "There's
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:46.380]   not enough evidence to justify belief in Jesus." There is enough evidence. No one spoke like
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:53.980]   this man. The self-authenticating glory of God shines in the gospel of Christ. So let's
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:59.440]   tell the good news. Tell it everywhere. Tell it all the time. Tell it as compellingly as
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:07.260]   we possibly can, and then let's pray. Let's pray earnestly, all the more earnestly, that
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:18.020]   God would open the eyes of the blind. Yes, amen. 5,800 manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.340]   of the New Testament. That's simply staggering. Thank you, Pastor John. And thanks for joining
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.180]   us today. If you're wrestling with a hard question that you need settled, ask Pastor
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.820]   John. Email your question to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.380]   Next time we field a question, I can certainly relate to myself. We read our Bible in the
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.980]   morning. We come across a promise or a text in the Old Testament. We write that text out
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:48.380]   in a notebook, a journal, digital note file, something. And we take that text or promise
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.940]   into our day. And later in the day, we return to the text to find ourselves wondering if
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.740]   we lifted the verse out of context. We ask, "Maybe it didn't really relate to me like
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:04.620]   I thought this morning." The text feels more remote as the day goes on. Has that ever happened
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:09.340]   to you? Well, it's happened to me, and it's happened to Maureen as well. We need to figure
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:14.540]   out what Old Testament promises are for us today, and we will next time. I'm your host,
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.180]   Tony Reinke. We'll see you Thursday.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.180]   [END]
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.240]   you
