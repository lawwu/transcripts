[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.640]   What does my stealing say about my soul?
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.160]   Stealing manifests in a lot of different forms.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.840]   It could be looting, could be shoplifting,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.880]   could be cutting corners at work,
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.280]   could be fudging on tax forms.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.360]   But what is this impulse to steal, this urge inside of us?
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.160]   What does it say about us?
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160]   That was the question Pastor John took up
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.680]   in a 1986 sermon on Ephesians 4.28,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.880]   a text where Paul writes this, quote,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.920]   "Let the thief no longer steal,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.420]   "but rather let him labor,
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.020]   "doing honest work with his own hands,
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.980]   "so that he may have something to share
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.220]   "with anyone in need," end quote.
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.320]   That word on stealing was given to Christians
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.440]   in a local church.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.280]   That's right, two Christians who are members
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.940]   of the local church in Ephesus on stealing.
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.160]   Here's Pastor John to explain.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.800]   In the wilderness, Jesus was tempted by the devil.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.760]   You remember what he said?
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.880]   The devil said to Jesus, "If you're the son of God,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.160]   "turn these stones into bread because you're hungry."
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.280]   What he really said was, "Look,
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.280]   "why don't you just short circuit the way of the cross?
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.020]   "Why don't you just do an end run around self-denial
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.800]   "and hard suffering work?
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.980]   "I mean, you have the power, it would be easy."
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.940]   And Satan comes to you and he says,
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.760]   "Look, why don't you just take it?
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.820]   "Why don't you just run an end run around hard work
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.320]   "and honesty and labor?
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.000]   "Just take it.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.920]   "You can have it.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.500]   "Nobody would know."
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.820]   Satan tempts us to steal from our employees
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.860]   with unjust wages.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.260]   He tempts us to steal from our employers
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.260]   with shoddy work and with long coffee breaks.
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.340]   He tempts you to shoplift at the store.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.420]   He tempts you not to report all your income
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.140]   on your income tax.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.480]   Where does stealing come from?
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.840]   Jesus said, "Out of the heart come evil thoughts,
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.360]   "murder, adultery, fornication, and theft."
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.600]   That's where it comes from.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.720]   It comes right out of the heart.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.160]   It didn't come from the moon.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.280]   It came from my heart.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.160]   That's why I steal.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.040]   My heart is corrupt.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.240]   And why is it corrupt?
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.480]   My desires are bad.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.120]   And why are my desires bad?
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.200]   Because I'm blinded and hardened in my sin
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.920]   and Satan has free access and he deceives me
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.600]   about what is valuable in the world
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.200]   so that I really believe it is more valuable
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.320]   to have this little pleasure in security
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.400]   than to have a clear conscience and to obey God
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.320]   and to love people.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.560]   Awesome deceit in the world.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.480]   If we could see things clearly, we wouldn't steal.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.440]   That's the first thing we can say about stealing.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.160]   It's part of the old deceived self.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   Second, stealing, brothers and sisters, can be forgiven.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.360]   It's so plain here in verse 28.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.320]   "Let the thief no longer steal."
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.360]   He's talking to thieves at Ephesus.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.080]   There are thieves in the church at Ephesus.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.840]   There are thieves sitting in the pews
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.800]   listening to this letter being read
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.360]   by the elders at Ephesus.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   And he's saying, "Now guys, ladies, don't do that anymore."
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.600]   Which clearly implies you're saved, you're forgiven.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.180]   You don't have to go on stealing.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.140]   There's possibility of being a new kind of person now.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.500]   And I can imagine an old recent convert
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.620]   from a life of debauchery and thievery
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.540]   standing up in the service and say,
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.700]   "Wait a minute, elder.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.500]   All my life I've stolen and I think it's too late for me.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500]   I can't shake it.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.900]   I can't get it out of my conscience.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.780]   I find it almost impossible to resist
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.340]   in the stores and marketplaces.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.500]   I think it's too late for me."
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.700]   And you know what that elder is gonna say to him?
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.540]   He's gonna say, "Don't you remember the story
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.380]   the apostle told us when he came through here
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.380]   just a few weeks ago
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.660]   and what happened to Jesus on the cross at the end?
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.300]   There was this thief.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.900]   All his life he'd been a rotten thief
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.180]   and he got killed for it.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.220]   He got hung for it.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.220]   And in the last breath of his life,
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.500]   he looks over to Jesus and he says,
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.340]   "Have mercy upon me.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.740]   When you come into your kingdom, remember me."
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.340]   And in the twinkling of an eye
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.340]   by the authority of God and the power of his cross,
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.180]   he says, "Today you will be with me in paradise.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.660]   It isn't too late."
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.260]   Thieves can be forgiven in the eleventh hour.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.540]   Stealing must be conquered,
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.340]   not by your own willpower merely.
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.980]   That makes Pharisees,
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.020]   people who boast,
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.460]   who rise up above sinners and say,
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.700]   "I thank you God that I am not like this publican."
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.820]   Pharisees are produced by willpower.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.220]   Broken and humble saints are produced
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.780]   by grace through faith.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.580]   Now, what truth must you have faith in
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.020]   to conquer stealing?
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.540]   Well, you could tell me the promises
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.700]   that will kill stealing in your heart.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.780]   Listen to this one from Hebrews 13.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.940]   "Keep your life free from the love of money
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.820]   and be content with what you have.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.780]   For He has said,"
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.820]   and here comes the truth
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.700]   that you must believe to conquer the stealing,
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.660]   "I will never fail you or forsake you.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.500]   Hence, we can confidently say,
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.140]   'The Lord is my helper.
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.180]   What can man do to me?'"
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.540]   Now, do you realize what this text says?
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.300]   This text says,
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.900]   every time you steal,
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.980]   you are an unbeliever in this promise.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.340]   The Lord of lords and king of kings
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.980]   who is strong enough to rule the world,
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.780]   wise enough to design the DNA and the Milky Way,
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.740]   and sovereign enough to govern the drop
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.380]   of every dead bird in Bangladesh,
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.580]   has said to every one of His children,
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.580]   "I will never leave you.
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.060]   I will never fail you.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.820]   I will never forsake you."
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.540]   Can you believe that and steal?
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.060]   No.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.940]   You have to be a disbeliever
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.980]   in the promises of God to steal.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.620]   That's why it's so horrid.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.140]   That's why Paul said,
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.220]   "Thieves do not enter into the kingdom
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.500]   because they don't believe God
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.700]   in their day-to-day walk.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.620]   They don't believe His promises."
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.340]   Now, let me give you an illustration
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.500]   of how this week I was tempted to steal
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.900]   very genuinely,
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.980]   and how I fought the fight of faith.
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.820]   Mid-September, I got in the mail
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.700]   a bill from the Minneapolis Water Works
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.260]   and Sewer Department.
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.860]   And the bill was $84.20.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.580]   And at the bottom in a little box,
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.460]   it says, "After September 30, pay gross."
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.860]   And then it said $88.41.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.020]   $4.21 more.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.180]   And I said, "I'll pay that."
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.060]   And I laid it in a pile
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.220]   and forgot about it until Friday.
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.340]   Friday.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.900]   That's October 3rd.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.060]   I was writing my check for all these bills
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.820]   that I had to pay, and I got to this one
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.940]   and almost just listened to the voice
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.540]   that was saying,
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.540]   "You always pay your bills.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.660]   You're a good citizen.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.740]   If you date your check September 30,
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.740]   they'll let it go.
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.580]   They won't give a hoot.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.060]   You won't lose four of God's dollars."
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.660]   And then another little voice,
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.900]   the new John Piper who struggles to stay alive
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.740]   and fights for his breath at these times,
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.260]   said, "It's your fault for not standing it.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.620]   And it's not unjust of them to require
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.900]   more for delinquent payments.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.700]   And the Spirit of Christ is always submissive
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.340]   to the governing authorities
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.900]   when no sin is involved.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.460]   And a clear conscience is more valuable than $4.
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.180]   And your Master has bidden you not to steal.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.580]   And He will never leave you nor forsake you.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.180]   And He will work all things together for your good."
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.460]   And the thought came to my mind
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.700]   as a specific illustration of that,
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.580]   if God thought it were good for you,
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.340]   He could heal the cavity in your tooth
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.140]   and save you $40 anyway.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.540]   There are a thousand ways
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.900]   God can take care of His children
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.140]   when they're honest and obedient.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.740]   And a thousand ways He won't if they're not.
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.660]   So I fought what I believe
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.220]   is the typical fight of every day of our life,
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.900]   the fight to believe the promises of God.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.500]   "Will He take care of me if I do right?
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.620]   Will He make my life better if I give up $4
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.300]   instead of keeping $4?
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.700]   Of course He will, He's God!"
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.420]   And God won the victory.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.740]   And I feel good and clean about that now.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.140]   Two days' worth of a clean conscience is worth $4.
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.940]   Always bringing the application down
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.460]   into the simplest everyday decisions of life.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.940]   That was John Piper and his sermon
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.700]   preached on October 5th, 1986,
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.660]   entitled "Don't Steal, Work and Give."
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.100]   You can find the entire sermon right now
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.660]   at DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.420]   This is a clip that I like.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.980]   It's one that I found while listening
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.900]   to John Piper sermons on my walks.
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.900]   Sometimes I do that.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.780]   And if you have a favorite sermon clip
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.420]   of Pastor John's, send it to me.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.940]   Give me the title of the sermon
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.380]   and the timestamps and the audio
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.820]   of when the clip begins and ends.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.420]   And tell me why it's impacted you.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.860]   What is it about this clip that resonates with you?
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.620]   Give me your name and the closest city to you.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.620]   Email all that information to me
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.820]   at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.820]   That's an email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.380]   Put the word clip in the subject line,
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.660]   if you would please.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.740]   Be a little easier for me to find it.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.180]   I appreciate it.
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:13.100]   Well, Friday is 8/28, August 28th.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.700]   The date reminds me of Romans 8, 28.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.300]   And it makes me think about all of the emails
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.660]   that have been sent in from you, the listeners.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.460]   Those of you who especially have been
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.100]   enduring unspeakable suffering.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.380]   There's a lot of you out there, I know it.
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.860]   And on Friday, we're gonna look at one of,
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.620]   I think, the most heartbreaking emails
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.200]   maybe we've ever addressed on the podcast.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.140]   I'm not even gonna preview it.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.780]   Just join us, be with us.
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.340]   I'm Tony Renke.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.940]   We'll see you back here on Friday
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.240]   with Pastor John and studio.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.300]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:12:03.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
