[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai, and in this episode I want to share some insights
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.720]   on being a venture capitalist and maybe what is the hardest thing about being a venture
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.600]   capitalist right now besides making a whole ton of money.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:22.240]   I recently went on this trip with my buddies to see a tennis tournament, and at the tennis
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.800]   tournament were a lot of venture capitalists.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.600]   And I have said before that being a venture capitalist is one of the best jobs you can
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.240]   get because you get paid a pretty good salary, six figures, 150, 200, 250, 500,000, a million,
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.960]   depending on how senior you are.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.160]   And then you get to charge, you know, your fund gets charged 2% of assets under management,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.480]   and the fund gets to earn about 20% of profits above a certain preferred rate of return.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.400]   So let's say the fund makes $100 million, you can take 20% of that, so $20 million,
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.720]   and then divide it among the partners, the general partners.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.000]   Not bad, right?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.400]   And one of the interesting things about being a venture capitalist is that you really won't
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.040]   know how good of an investor you are until maybe five, ten years down the road, because
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.600]   your fund invests with a 10-year time horizon.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.880]   So as the general partner, as a venture capitalist, you invest for the first three years of the
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.840]   life of the fund, and then you hope in five to ten years, thereabouts, some of your investments
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.000]   will play out in terms of getting acquired or going public.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.960]   Meanwhile, in those 10 years, not only are you earning your base salary, you're also
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.800]   starting new funds, right?
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.100]   You want to start a new fund every two to three years.
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.640]   So in a 10-year period, you could start three to five new funds.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.000]   And over a course of five to ten years for each new fund you start, you really won't
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.160]   know how well the fund will perform until the end.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.960]   So what do you do in the meantime?
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.120]   Well, what you do is you have to be a good marketer.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.880]   If you want to be a good venture capitalist, you have to have a platform, you have to say
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.360]   smart things, and you need to win deals.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.040]   That was the number one thing three VCs told me during this trip on what is the hardest
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.960]   part about being a VC.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.880]   And that's winning deals, because if you see a hot deal, chances are high that five, seven,
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.600]   ten other venture capitalists will want to participate in that deal.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.840]   And the company can only raise so much money, right?
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.120]   It has a target raise of a certain amount to get diluted or give up equity a certain
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.740]   amount, and that's it.
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.680]   So you have a limited supply of great companies, and you have a huge available supply of capital
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.860]   searching for these companies.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.560]   So there is actually still, there's still a demand supply mismatch.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.480]   And one of the other great things about being a VC is that you actually don't even need
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.040]   to build your own company, start your own company, be an entrepreneur, grind it out,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.160]   raise capital for five, ten years.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.120]   You can actually be a VC by going to business school and then just joining a VC shop.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.880]   Or you can be a VC by having a large platform, and you go work at a company, maybe you do
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.080]   work at a startup, but you don't found a startup, and maybe you could get hired as well.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.360]   The final thing I learned about the venture capital world is that it's very tight.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   So at every single stage of fundraising, whether it's pre-seed, seed, series A, B, C, D, E,
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.160]   F, and then IPO, you need to know the other players in the venture capital and private
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   equity community.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.880]   Because when you invest in a company, you sing its praises, you market it, you hope
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.700]   that it's going to do well, and you try to support it as much as possible.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.180]   And what happens is you then call your friend who works at another venture capital company
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.960]   that does later stage investing than your company, and you say, "Hey, this company is
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.680]   going to be raising a new round of funding, would you like to participate?"
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.600]   So in other words, it's a network effect, and it's about selling your deal to the next
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.580]   VC buyer, or next private equity buyer, all the way up so you can get some exit.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.800]   And then the next guy buys, and then hopefully they can get an exit by selling to the next
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.760]   larger private equity or venture capital fund.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.600]   Given how tight the community is, it's so important for you to have a good reputation.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.080]   Because if you have a bad reputation, you're bad-mouthing, you're undercutting, then it's
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.040]   going to be much harder for you to win deals, and then it's going to be much harder for
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.440]   you to build relationships to sell your company to the next venture capital firm.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.120]   And it goes on and on until the initial public offering, where retail investors get to invest
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.680]   at that stage.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.180]   And we know from studying companies over the past 20 years that private companies are staying
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:18.880]   private longer, which means a lot of the gains are going towards private equity investors,
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.840]   venture capital investors, versus the gains going towards retail investors.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.880]   So a lot of people have asked me, why bother investing in venture capital, private equity,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.600]   when you can just invest in the S&P 500, it's proven to return about 10% a year since 1926,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.240]   low fees, and it's just a simple way to get rich slowly.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.560]   Well, as I just said, the main reason, or one of the main reasons, is because gains
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.880]   are accruing more towards private investors versus public investors.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.840]   So the days where Microsoft went public and retail investors were able to profit 10x,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   20x, 50x, is becoming harder and harder.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.860]   At the same time, investing in private companies is very risky.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.040]   So investing in a fund, in a venture capital fund, or private equity fund, helps diversify
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.360]   the risk.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.180]   And hopefully you invest with the top GPs with the greatest network and the best reputations.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.080]   And when you can, you hold on and you try to keep on investing in every single vintage
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.600]   period year.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.200]   Now one of the reasons why I'm talking about venture capital is because recently with the
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.780]   bank run and the shutting down of Silicon Valley Bank, the venture capital community
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.440]   has been in the spotlight.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.280]   A lot of venture capitalists, prominent venture capitalists, were shouting over Twitter, save
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.040]   SVB and all the depositors, and also entrepreneurs and politicians and regular folks.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.440]   If not, there was going to be a huge negative knock on effect on the economy.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.640]   And I got caught up in this as well because several weeks, I would say three weeks before
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:07.080]   SVB collapsed, I sent $20,000 to SVB through a wire to meet a capital call for a venture
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.320]   capital fund I'm invested in.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:17.760]   Now never in my wildest dreams did I think wiring money to SVB would put me at risk of
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.640]   losing that money within three weeks.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.880]   I didn't think about that.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:29.120]   I didn't calculate that in my risk because where the venture capital fund banks with
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.940]   is up to them.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.980]   For me, I'm deciding, OK, whether I should commit capital to this venture capital fund
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.440]   in the first place.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:45.180]   So now after this entire sequence of events, I'm now thinking, OK, I got to decide which
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.560]   general partners I believe in, which venture capital fund or other private fund I believe
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.560]   in.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.160]   And I got to ask them, how are your banking relationships?
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.640]   How many do you have?
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.980]   What are your contingency plans if there are future bank runs?
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.720]   And how do you plan to get capital out?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.440]   Now I've just assumed you know what a capital call is.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.660]   But if you don't, it's simply when a private fund asks for a percentage of the capital
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.460]   you've committed to investing in their fund.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:21.280]   For example, there could be a 10% capital call of $100,000 you committed.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.020]   So that equals $10,000.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:31.760]   And any of these private funds tends to invest your committed capital over a two to four
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.800]   year period usually.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.080]   And then after it invests, it's a J curve.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.160]   So they invest, you don't make money, you actually kind of lose money in the beginning
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.160]   years.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.060]   And then over time, you hopefully make a profit.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.760]   So that's a capital call.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.280]   Don't confuse that with a margin call.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.160]   And in a pretty detailed post, I talk about how to better manage your capital calls.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.040]   Because it's nice to invest in private funds once you've done the research and made a commitment.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.600]   You don't really have to think about what to buy, when to buy, and when to sell.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.720]   All you've got to do is meet your capital calls when they are called.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.200]   And if you don't meet your capital calls, that's no good because you're going to put
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.240]   the general partners who've likely already funded the deal in a bind.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.320]   And I was speaking to one of the general partners of a venture debt fund that I invest in.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.120]   I've invested with him for the past eight years.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.760]   And he said that generally, his fund funds the deal, makes the investment after the term
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.720]   sheets are signed immediately.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.920]   And where do they get that capital?
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.540]   Well, they get that capital from the line of credit from the bank they use.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.240]   So in this venture debt fund's case, it was First Republic Bank.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:54.320]   Aha, another bank that is seeing a lot of deposit outflow because this run on regional
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   banks.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:02.920]   So the private fund's bank provides a line of credit of between 30 to 60 days usually.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.880]   You think about it as a bridge loan.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:11.760]   So the fund borrows this money so it can invest in an identified investment immediately.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:18.400]   And then the fund announces a capital call, usually with a 30 day maximum time limit to
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.200]   get all the LPs to send in their funds.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:28.760]   Now sometimes LPs are late because they're traveling or they haven't seen the emails.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.800]   It's generally fine.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.720]   You generally have like a 30 day grace period, right?
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.020]   Because if you have a 60 day line of credit with a bank, if the fund has a 60 day line
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:42.680]   of credit with a bank and they do a 30 day deadline capital call, they still have a 30
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.360]   day buffer.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.600]   But after 30 days, it's going to be problematic.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.040]   The GPs will send you reminder after reminder.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.420]   And if you don't send in that capital call, I would think that the funds will withhold
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:02.220]   any future distributions so you can become whole on your capital commitments.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.780]   And then worst case, they could go after you.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:12.600]   And then at that point, you're clearly blackballed from any future deals in that fund and probably
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:18.120]   any future funds in the industry because it's a small industry and everybody talks.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.360]   Nobody wants that cancerous virus LP investor.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:32.280]   Now what do all these bank runs mean for investors, VC investors, private equity investors, borrowers
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.440]   and the banks?
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:40.040]   Well, at the moment, I would assume for the next 30 to 60 days, all banks, especially
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:45.920]   regional banks, smaller banks are going to be much more stringent on their lending.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:53.260]   Lending to refinance, lending to new potential homeowners, doing venture debt lending to
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.080]   private companies.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.540]   And I assume the terms for these bridge loans might be more stringent.
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.240]   They might be shorter and they might have a higher interest rate as well to account
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.740]   for more risk.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.800]   When there's more risk, banks charge more.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:15.940]   Given more stringent lending standards and higher interest rates and fees, we can logically
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:23.380]   assume that fewer companies will get funded, fewer people will get loans, and just the
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.600]   economy is deflationary for the economy.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.920]   As a result, it is important for all of us to continue staying patient.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:40.940]   Yes, the Fed raised rates again to 5% on the Fed funds rate on March 22nd, 2023.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.340]   Will they raise one more time?
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:49.100]   It seems like the Fed funds future is expecting yes, one more time, 25 base points and that's
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.420]   it or no more times and that's it.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.740]   But the futures market is expecting up to a 1% cut in the Fed funds rate by the end
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.740]   of 2023.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:06.780]   However, Jerome Powell is saying, no, we plan to hold the Fed funds rate flat at least for
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.780]   the remainder of the year.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:14.440]   Therefore, it's really hard to tell the direction of the S&P 500.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.380]   The median target price is again around 4085.
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:25.420]   And it seems like at this rate, it could be pretty spot on plus or minus 100 points.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.460]   It's really hard for me to chase equities at this level.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.840]   However, there are good signs in the housing market, right?
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:40.240]   Because mortgage rates have come down by at least 50 base points and you're seeing a rebound
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.560]   in new home sales and existing home sales.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.020]   Pay attention to that, folks.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:51.420]   I still think this summer, 2023 is a good time to buy, good time to get a deal, especially
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.220]   if mortgage rates continue to come down.
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.700]   And I am seeing more activity pick up.
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.980]   Now, in conclusion, let me share some tips on how to better manage your capital calls
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.300]   if you decide to invest in more private funds.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:11.660]   I think you might if you get wealthier and older because there are more opportunities
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.340]   to invest in interesting private opportunities.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.220]   Maybe the returns won't be as good as the public stock market or maybe they might be
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.700]   really, really good.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.040]   It depends like everything on what you invested and who you invest with.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.420]   But in terms of capital calls, it can get pretty hairy if you have multiple funds in
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.980]   your portfolio.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.580]   So one, organize everything in a spreadsheet.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:40.100]   Put a date of investment, fund name, investment commitment, amount, lifespan, range of the
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:46.860]   fund, estimated capital call amounts by year, capital call as a percentage of cash flow,
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.420]   capital call as a percentage of investments.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.740]   And you've got to consistently update the spreadsheet so you can manage your cash flow
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.320]   and never be late in sending in your capital calls.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.060]   You want to be a good LP.
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.820]   Two, be realistic about your future income and cash flow.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.660]   When investing in private funds, it's easy to get all hyped up and amped up after you're
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.540]   reading the marketing material.
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.740]   After all, good marketing makes you want to buy.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.780]   And whenever you read any kind of marketing material, if they do it well, you're going
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.980]   to want to probably invest a lot more money.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.820]   And you could commit more than you think because you're thinking, "Well, that money is invested
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.020]   over a two to four year period."
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.740]   And then you might end up investing more than you should and in more funds than you should.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:39.020]   So you've really got to be realistic about your future income and cash flow because everything
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:44.500]   tends to look good when you are getting marketed to by a private fund manager.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.540]   Three, be stringent with your capital allocation percentages.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.620]   You got to know your risk tolerance and your financial objectives.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.200]   Also take into consideration your age.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.420]   If the fund has a 10 year horizon and you're 65 years old, well, unfortunately, chances
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:06.740]   are, I don't know, maybe 40% you might die before the fund actually sees a liquidity
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.740]   event.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.060]   So be realistic.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.700]   As you get older, maybe private funds aren't for you because you won't be able to reap
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:18.100]   any of the rewards unless you plan to invest for a younger generation.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:25.060]   Personally, I try to allocate no more than 10% of my net worth or 10% of my investable
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.920]   assets into private investments.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.720]   And I let it fade up to 15%, hopefully if there's good returns.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.220]   And then once it's at 15%, I throttle it down.
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.740]   If you look at endowment funds, like from Yale endowment fund, it's like 25 billion
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.020]   or something.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:47.220]   A lot of these endowment funds actually invest in venture capital, private equity, and all
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.620]   sorts of other private funds.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.940]   So it's not unique.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:57.860]   In actuality, it's more common than investing in public equities and public bonds.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.980]   And the returns have been okay, not bad.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.820]   But again, it's all about who you know and which funds you invest with.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:10.140]   Finally, to better manage your capital calls, I highly encourage you to read the quarterly
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.260]   updates.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.840]   They will be in your portal.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.860]   Or listen in on the quarterly conference calls.
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.900]   And get to know one of the GPs and ask them questions offline.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:24.420]   Especially if you feel like you're not going to be able to meet a capital commitment, just
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.460]   ask.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.260]   Any thoughts on future investments?
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.900]   Any estimate on when you'll do another capital call?
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.180]   You can gain clarity if you want because you're all on the same team.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:40.500]   My problem is that I barely read or listen to any quarterly investment reports or calls
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.580]   because I'm more interested in writing on Financial Samurai, recording this podcast,
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.620]   working on my next book, spending time with family, and playing sports.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.500]   My thought is the less time I spend staying on top of my private investments, the greater
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.780]   the return on investment.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.380]   I've already done all the due diligence.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.860]   I've asset allocated appropriately.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.780]   But because I don't pay that much attention, it's good for the stress.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.540]   If I don't pay attention, it's out of sight, out of mind.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.420]   But I also get in trouble where I can't meet some capital calls or I need to scramble to
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:19.620]   meet them because I improperly managed my cash flow and savings.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.260]   Especially with treasury bonds yielding over 5%.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:28.580]   I've just been funneling any normal operating cash flow into treasury bonds recently.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.780]   Alrighty folks, that's it for me.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:36.140]   I know this topic might not be too pertinent for most of you investing in private funds
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.140]   and all that.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.500]   But it's something interesting to know given the bank runs, given the liquidity issues,
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:47.540]   given the need to have important banking relationships, and also my realization that, huh, I didn't
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.660]   think I would get caught up in this because I was properly diversified with my banking
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.220]   relationships, but I have.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:59.860]   Now thankfully nothing bad has happened to anybody's deposits and let's hope it continues
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.140]   that way.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.420]   Thank you everyone for listening and special shout out to Maureen for leaving that awesome
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.140]   five star review on Apple.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.540]   It really means a lot to me.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.460]   I just try to be as honest as possible.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.980]   I try to highlight the blind spot that I have so we can all learn.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.980]   And I'm always trying to learn from all of you.
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.580]   So thank you so much for your support and thank you all for leaving a nice review.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.100]   It's very motivating.
