[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.620]   Some Christians believe in and use New Year's resolutions, others are anti New
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.960]   Year's resolutions. We're getting a number of email questions on this now.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.720]   Pastor John, for Christians, are New Year's resolutions helpful? Are they
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.880]   harmful? Are they just a setup for failure? Or are they simply unnecessary?
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.320]   Well, as always, Tony, it depends on what you mean by resolutions. If you mean
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:35.000]   declarations of what you intend to do by dint of willpower, then that will not
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.320]   only probably fail, if it doesn't fail, it's not Christian either. So if it
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.200]   fails, it fails, and if it succeeds, it fails, because that's not what the
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.760]   Christian life is. It's not lived that way. Not at the beginning of a year, not
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.200]   at the beginning of a day, or beginning of an hour. You don't screw up your
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:08.120]   willpower to obey a command and resolve to do a thing by virtue of strong
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.480]   resolution and call that Christianity. It's not. The mystery of holiness is
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:23.880]   that we live our lives in the strength of another. That is, we walk by the Spirit.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.480]   We walk by faith in the power of another. We depend on another, namely the Holy
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.280]   Spirit, to do in us and through us what needs to be done so that another, namely
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.840]   God, will get the glory. The principle, whether it's New Year, New Morning, New
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:53.920]   Hour, is 1 Peter 4 11. "Let him who serves serve in the strength that God
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.560]   supplies." So you can paraphrase it, "Let him who resolves to do a thing or not do
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.480]   a thing resolve in the strength that God supplies so that in everything God may
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   be glorified through Jesus Christ to him be glory forever." So yes, go ahead, resolve.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.520]   Paul put it like this, "By the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.920]   toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.640]   them." So he gets up in the morning and he says, "What do I have to do today? Well, I
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.040]   have to travel to Philippi, I have to make three tents tonight, I have to prepare a
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.000]   message for tomorrow morning. I resolve to do those things." And then he says, "Though
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.600]   it was not I, but the grace of God that was with me." 1 Corinthians 15 10. Or he
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.760]   says in Romans 15 8, "I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.040]   has accomplished through me to bring obedience to the Gentiles." So he says,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.720]   "We're going to Spain, let's go! I resolve to go to Spain, I've got this ambition to
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.200]   preach the gospel where Christ has not been named, let's go!" And then he writes,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.680]   "I'm not going to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.560]   through me." So his resolutions are empowered by, sustained by, worked through
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.440]   the grace of Christ, which is right at the heart of what it means to live the
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.360]   Christian life, not just make resolutions. Philippians 1 12, "Work out
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.080]   your salvation with fear and trembling, for God is the one who is at work in you."
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.680]   Which could be paraphrased, "Resolve, make a resolution with fear and trembling, for
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.880]   God is the one who's the making the resolution in you." That's the way to live
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.160]   the Christian life. So my answer is yes, we should make resolves lots of times,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.960]   not just at the beginning of a year. Whenever we feel, whenever we see
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.120]   something that we should be doing that we're not doing, we should resolve. Do it!
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.720]   Whenever we're not doing something that we should be doing and we recognize that
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.600]   we're not doing it, we should resolve. Don't do it! Or did I say that backwards?
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.160]   You know what I mean. We got it. Resolve not to do what you shouldn't do and
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.160]   resolve to do what you should do whenever you see that you're not doing
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.520]   it or that you're doing it. God doesn't like for our hearts to be irresolute.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.520]   He says, "That'd be the opposite, wouldn't it? The opposite of resolving is to be
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.480]   irresolute, undecisive." And here's what Elijah said about that. "How long will
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.520]   you go limping between two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.080]   If Baal is God, follow Him." So resolve this day. Who are you going to serve? Get off
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.720]   the fence and follow your Lord. And I think there are a lot of Christians who
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.200]   are afraid of resolutions, and the opposite of resolution is not this
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.840]   wonderful freedom of dependence on God to empower them, it's sitting on a fence
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.800]   and not making any commitments to be or do a certain thing. Paul said,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.560]   this has been really important in my understanding, Tony, of tough decisions. He
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.360]   said in Romans 14, 5, "One man esteems one day of another. Another esteems
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.760]   every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.640]   That's amazing! In other words, whether you go with saying, "All days are alike," or
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.920]   whether you go with esteeming one day above another, don't be wishy-washy!
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.560]   Don't waffle, don't sit on the fence. God doesn't like irresolute hearts. Make up
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:40.120]   your mind. Decide, resolve, act. So David says to the counselors of Solomon, "Set
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.840]   your mind and heart to seek the Lord." What is that but resolve? Set your mind
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:54.160]   and heart. About Rehoboam, the Bible says, "He did evil, for he did not set his
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.080]   heart to seek the Lord." He didn't resolve to seek the Lord. He just coasted in his
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.520]   life. So here's a theology of resolution in a verse, Tony. This is the
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.200]   most important two verses in the Bible on New Year's resolutions. So everybody
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.960]   should just go get their Bible, study these two verses, they'll have a
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.120]   theology of resolution. 2 Thessalonians 1, 11, and 12. "To this end, we
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.920]   always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling, and may
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:34.960]   fulfill," may God fulfill, "every resolve for good and every work of faith by his
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.080]   power, that the name of the Lord Jesus may be glorified." Everything is there. So
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.360]   here they are. You should resolve for good. Resolve good things in your life.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   Second, this is pursued by faith so that it's a work of faith. Third, God acts
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.840]   through that faith by his power. Fourth, thus God fulfills the good resolve. Fifth,
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.400]   thus Jesus gets glory. That's the theology of resolution in two verses.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.360]   2 Thessalonians 1, 11 to 12. So my answer is not just at New Year's, but all the
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.040]   time. Whenever we see we're falling short, resolve not to fall short, and whenever
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.320]   we see something that needs to be done, resolve to do it.
