[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.200]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.000]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.880]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.640]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.680]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.400]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.600]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.800]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.040]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.800]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.160]   But don't forget,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.760]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.760]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.640]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.160]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.720]   Well listeners, I am excited to be with you today.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.600]   I am excited to be with a dear friend of mine
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.880]   that I've not been able to talk to for a number of years.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.320]   Our paths have led us in different directions.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.840]   But I have with me today, Rachel Moriarty.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.400]   Rachel is a dear friend who is a classical educator,
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.240]   a fellow homeschooling mom.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.800]   And I want Rachel to tell you a little bit
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.720]   about her family and her current journey.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.720]   And then Rachel is going to help us
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.880]   find the gentle joy in assessment.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.240]   We're gonna talk about that,
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.880]   'cause I know some of you are rolling your eyes
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.080]   when you see those three words together
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.240]   and think it's not gentle, it's not joyous,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.360]   it's just assessment.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360]   But Rachel's gonna help us see it in a new way.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.520]   Rachel, I'm so glad you could be with me today.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.440]   - Thank you very much, Lisa, for having me.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   I really appreciate it.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.480]   I am very excited to be here
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.120]   and to share a little bit about the journey
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.840]   that God has taken me on.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.760]   So I am a long time been in CC.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.240]   Actually, you and I were in a training years ago.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.520]   - Yes, yes.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.040]   - We first met maybe like 15 years ago or more.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.840]   - Yeah, it was a long time.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.160]   - It was a long time ago.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.920]   But that's one thing about homeschooling
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.680]   is that the world of homeschooling is small, isn't it?
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.840]   And we get to cross paths over and over again.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.960]   So I'm excited to be able to cross paths with you today.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.040]   So let me introduce myself a little bit.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.160]   I have six children
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.960]   and I have been homeschooling with Classical Conversations
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.960]   since my oldest was four, she's 21 now.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   And I actually always say that CC raised me up as a woman.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   They were, it was my second mom
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.080]   and I really love how God taught me the classical tools
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.720]   and learning everything that we wanna give to our kids.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.080]   I got to learn right alongside my children as they grew.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   So we are, well, I say we are, man,
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.720]   we were a military family,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.040]   but my husband just retired from the military.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.280]   He played the tuba for the Navy band for over 20 years.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.440]   And as of right now,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.640]   he is job searching as a project manager.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.600]   And we are looking at possibly heading back overseas
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.080]   to do some missionary work.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.680]   But in the meantime,
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.200]   I am very passionate about empowering
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.160]   and helping families in their journey.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.160]   I would say that so much of my confidence
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.920]   came out of times when other moms who were seasoned
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.280]   and ahead of me turned and said,
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.840]   "Hey, you can do this," right?
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.480]   That's the hardest part is feeling like you can't do it
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.400]   and it's a lie from the enemy.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.920]   So I'm excited to now turn
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.880]   and do that for my other moms and dads
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.000]   who are starting their journey or on their journey
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.880]   and just need some encouragement
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.000]   and glad to be able to do that here today
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.800]   and in the conversation of assessment.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.880]   - Yeah, thank you so much, Rachel.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.280]   I love that you have taken on the mantle
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.880]   of encouraging younger moms and dads
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.920]   who are coming behind where you have walked
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.520]   in the homeschooling journey because that is huge.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.040]   That's very valuable.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.640]   You are exactly right.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.720]   Most of us, when we first started out,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.680]   just needed somebody to say,
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.600]   "Hey, you can keep doing this.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   You can make this and link arms with us
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.960]   and walk forward beside of us."
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.160]   And pretty much that's what kept me going
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.720]   at the beginning is being able to see
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.760]   that someone else was willing to walk alongside of me
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.040]   and help me do the things I was a little unsure of
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.040]   or a little afraid to try or not sure I was doing correctly.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.920]   And so that is awesome.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   And I thank you, Rachel, for being willing
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.040]   to give us the benefit of the hard lessons
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.520]   that you have learned.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.160]   I know that for me,
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.960]   I used to be in the middle of some really hard times
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.840]   and think, "Well, Lord, I hope you are redeeming this
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.880]   for someone else's benefit
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.360]   because this feels really awful where I am."
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.840]   And it does.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.160]   It does redeem it when we can look back and think,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.520]   "Yeah, that was hard, but I learned some good lessons
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.160]   and I'm not gonna keep it to myself
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.200]   because I wish somebody had told me
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.720]   or I wish somebody had known to tell me
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.080]   what could have helped me."
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.080]   So today, Rachel is going to help us with assessment.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.560]   A lot of us, when we come to the spring semester
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.560]   of homeschooling, that whole idea of assessment gets real.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.560]   It's not that we weren't, hopefully,
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.360]   assessing our children all through the fall
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.040]   and all through the winter,
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.040]   but when the end of the "school year"
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.240]   starts to loom large in our view,
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.160]   we think, "Oh my word, I've got to know.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.960]   I mean, did we accomplish what we were supposed to do?
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.320]   Do my children know what they need to know?
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.600]   Have my children changed in the positive ways
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.520]   that I had goals for in the fall?"
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.400]   And so assessment becomes a bigger topic.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.280]   So as an online community,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.600]   we want to explore that a little bit together.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.000]   And I will just tell you guys,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.040]   we're gonna take about three weeks
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.360]   to fully unpack this topic.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.320]   So you set aside some listening time
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.080]   over the next three weeks
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.080]   so that you get the whole load of benefit from Rachel
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.280]   'cause we're gonna start out really simple today.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.680]   It's gonna be profound and might make a huge difference
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.040]   in what you and your spouse do in your homeschool,
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.120]   but it's pretty simple.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.400]   Rachel, I want to ask you,
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.160]   we want to talk about assessment,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.920]   and you've been assessing for a long time.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.320]   I assess my girls.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.560]   My girls are now grown, graduated from CC,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.840]   graduated from college, married with children
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.120]   or children on the way.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.720]   So I've done a lot of assessing
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.840]   and Rachel's done a lot of assessing.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.120]   Rachel, what's the usual reaction
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.840]   to the whole idea of assessment?
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.880]   What do you expect that people are thinking
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.800]   as we enter this topic?
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.160]   - Oh, it's terrifying.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.040]   I mean, who wants to be assessed, right?
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.520]   Like you're gonna tell me what I'm doing wrong.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.360]   No, thank you.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   I already know all the things that I'm doing wrong.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.240]   Why do I need you to tell me, right?
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.040]   - Yes, it just always seemed like a test
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.720]   that even if I wasn't doing everything wrong,
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.280]   the whole point of the quote unquote assessment
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.840]   was to tell me how I could at least be better.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.560]   - Right, well, and I think the negative connotation
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.600]   is the change in focus, right?
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.440]   - Yeah.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.120]   - Because in a classical setting of assessment,
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.120]   we are focused on what they have done well,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.160]   not on what they did poorly.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   Yes, as a parent or as a director in a CC classroom
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.960]   or as a teacher, you are looking at,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.360]   okay, what needs to be corrected?
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.920]   That's not a part of the equation,
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.080]   but the focus is actually on what they did well
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.240]   and what we can celebrate.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.160]   And it's real hard for people to consider the idea
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.920]   of assessment as a celebration,
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.920]   but that's exactly the paradigm that has to change, right?
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.280]   Is to go from something that's scary
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.720]   to something that is considered a celebration.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.840]   - I love that.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.880]   - I don't know if you, Lisa, are like me,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.240]   but in the years past, I had a hard time with celebrating.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.000]   Celebrating was not easy for me, you know?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.520]   And so I, the Lord has had to do a lot of healing
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.520]   in my heart and my life so that I could embrace the fact
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.240]   that He is a God of celebration, a God of feasting.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.040]   And He invites us to feast.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.400]   And you know, we've heard this metaphor,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.000]   how the Lord sets a table for us.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.840]   - Yes, yes.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.160]   - And He wants us to come not alone, but together.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.680]   I just like, I imagine this like really long table
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.920]   that's like endless, you know,
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.840]   of all of us next to it or at it.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.960]   And it's just filled with all these like good foods to eat,
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.040]   like foods you can never even imagine eating.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.760]   And He said, "Come and feast."
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.600]   And He wants us to feast at it daily.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.240]   And so that's a weird concept to be in correlation
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.240]   with assessment.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   How is assessment like going to a table to feast?
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.040]   - I can remember as a child,
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.360]   assessment just seemed to have
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.840]   some very dark, stern connotation, you know?
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.120]   And I was not a child that was ever afraid
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.360]   to get my report card.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.640]   I was a good student.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.120]   I was a people-pleasing, rule-following, good girl.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.880]   And so I was never afraid to get my report card.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.760]   But still, assessment always seemed like a very somber,
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.980]   a little scary thing to do.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.360]   I did not associate assessment with celebration,
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.560]   with balloons and confetti and happy sounds
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.000]   and high fives, you know?
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.320]   But I wish I had.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.320]   And that's the kind of assessment I would love to provide
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   for the students, whether they're children or adults,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.940]   the students that I have influence upon,
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.460]   I would like them to see assessment as a time
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.020]   for us to celebrate together how we have grown.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.380]   - Yes, yes.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.540]   And that we part is really interesting
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.220]   because if you think about a celebration or a feast,
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.420]   it's never alone.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.820]   Who wants to go to a party all by themselves, right?
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.900]   And so we can come together with our students.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.460]   And what's really interesting is in the homeschooling realm,
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.660]   the primary students are your children, right?
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.920]   So to be able to, like we are practicing celebrating
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.880]   in terms of like birthdays maybe,
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.880]   or holidays that we come together,
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.440]   we just finished Christmas, right?
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.240]   We're like, okay, this is the space
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.600]   in which we see celebration.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.480]   But to change the culture of our homes for assessment,
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.360]   to also be a part of this rhythm of celebration
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.160]   in our lives is a different way of thinking.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.840]   And it's a way that I would hope
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.640]   that others might come to embrace.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.360]   I mean, they might be like,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.020]   they might be nervous about this idea
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.480]   simply because it's a celebration, right?
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.320]   And maybe that's uncomfortable.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.600]   - It's super appealing though.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.640]   I mean, look at the contrast
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.640]   between the sober judgmental testing aspect
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:42.440]   or a party with hats and streamers and noisemakers.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.720]   - Right.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.120]   - I would much rather participate in that.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.120]   So what if we do want to change our mindset?
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.200]   That's a great place to start.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.080]   And we know that changing our mindset
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.280]   is the way to change our practice, our habits.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.840]   And that changes the culture of our family.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.720]   So we do want to change from doom to celebration.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.620]   And we want assessment to be a celebratory thing.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.800]   But what is assessment?
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.600]   Let's give people a definition.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.760]   What is it that we're talking about?
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.800]   What really is assessment?
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.480]   And maybe you want to tell us what it's not
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.920]   so that we can see more clearly what it is,
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.040]   but I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.880]   - Oh yeah, okay.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.240]   I like starting with what it's not
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.560]   'cause we can, that is like a good tangible part
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.240]   where we can easily see.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.600]   Okay, so what it's not
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.420]   is it's not just an end of the year thing.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.140]   I know that we typically think of it
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.660]   as a thing that happens at an end of something.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.100]   But assessment is actually at the beginning,
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.980]   it's at the middle, it's at the end,
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.020]   it's throughout the day when you stand up,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.900]   when you walk the way with your children, right?
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.080]   That the Lord refers to in Deuteronomy.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.580]   That's actually the verse that kind of drew me
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.000]   into homeschooling in the first place.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.460]   How can I do this all day long, every day?
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.760]   If I'm not with them, right?
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.580]   So that was a question that I had to wrestle.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.320]   So this assessment's the same way.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.500]   I like to think of assessment,
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.060]   and I know you're gonna maybe balk at this for a minute,
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:27.060]   but I like to think of it in terms of Sabbath, right?
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:32.560]   Like what does Sabbath and assessment have in common?
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.320]   - Huh, I've never ever had this thought.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.320]   I can't wait to pursue it with you.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.160]   - Okay, okay.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.760]   So, well, what are some words that come into your mind
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.880]   when you think of the word Sabbath?
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.880]   - Rest, set apart, holy, contemplation.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:07.160]   - Good.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.280]   - All that kind of stuff.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.280]   Just ceasing, stopping, thinking, praying.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.600]   - Reflecting.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.720]   - Reflecting, yes.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.640]   That whole idea of contemplation,
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.320]   sitting somewhere quiet with my thoughts
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.400]   so that I can actually hear my thoughts above the,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.520]   because there's not the busy jangle of all the voices
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.200]   and all of the to-dos on my list.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.320]   - Good, okay.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.920]   So are there different kinds of Sabbath?
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.620]   - I think that there are.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:47.240]   I think that you can have Sabbath that is just still
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:56.400]   where you are, in fact, mostly resting
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.640]   from activity and movement and busyness.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.560]   And I think there is Sabbath
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.280]   where you're taking a different kind of break.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.720]   Where you are maybe still doing something,
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.400]   but something different from what you usually do
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.000]   or in a different way,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   a more slow, reflective, intentional way.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.200]   - Okay, good.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.320]   - Yeah.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.080]   - Well, and so a lot of times we think of Sabbath
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.840]   as like a day of the week,
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.280]   whether it be Saturday or Sunday,
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.400]   or even a different day.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.560]   I've heard of pastors
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.640]   'cause they work really hard
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.880]   on coming in to leading a congregation.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.920]   So sometimes they Sabbath a different day of the week,
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.760]   right?
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.280]   And then we also have extended Sabbaths,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.080]   like summer rest from school in the years.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.720]   - Yes, or sabbatical.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.040]   I mean, my husband's a pastor
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.000]   and he had a six month sabbatical several years ago.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.640]   And so that was a different kind of, yeah.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.560]   - Exactly, an extended kind of Sabbath,
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.360]   but he's also still doing some of those other Sabbaths
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.720]   in that extended Sabbath, right?
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.520]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.440]   - And then even in the daytime where it says,
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.720]   the Lord says, come to me,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.640]   give us our day, our daily bread,
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.720]   come and sit before me
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.800]   and hear what I have to say, right?
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.120]   And so even that is a Sabbath as we just sit before him,
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.760]   be still and know that I am God,
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.200]   be still and know that I am with you.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   And so that's a form of rest
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.680]   that comes to our soul when we encounter him.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.240]   Well, assessment is very similar
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.000]   to Sabbath in all of these ways.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.600]   It is a time for reflection.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.920]   It is a time, there are different kinds of Sabbath,
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.960]   or excuse me, different kinds of assessment.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.920]   There are assessments that happen at the end of a year
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.160]   or the end of a season,
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.600]   but there are Sabbaths that are happening every day.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.760]   There are assessments periods happening every day
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.800]   with our students.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.000]   So I know maybe you've heard of like a morning meeting,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.840]   right?
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.680]   - Yes, yes.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.520]   - What do they call them?
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.760]   What are some other terms for morning meetings?
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.920]   That's what we call it.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:21.640]   - Some moms of littles call it morning basket time
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.200]   or couch time.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.080]   Or I remember when my girls were in challenge,
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.040]   when they were in the upper challenges,
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.400]   when they were way more independent,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.360]   we had morning check-in so that we could say,
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.640]   okay, how are you positioned for success today?
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.920]   Let's figure out each other's rhythms
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.400]   to see if we can have a family rhythm
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.640]   that will work for everybody today.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.280]   - Yes, ooh, that word rhythm, so good.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.920]   Definitely falls in line with Sabbathing
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.320]   and I don't need, I just turned that word into a verb,
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.840]   I'm not sure I should have.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.960]   - It works in our conversation.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.800]   - Okay, good.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.080]   Well, the same thing with assessing,
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.920]   there's rhythms to assessing.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.160]   So even my morning time with my students, my family,
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.240]   we usually take that time to just reflect on truth
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.440]   that God maybe has for us through some scriptures.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.280]   We also have some conversation,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.440]   but it's also a time in which we're reflecting
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.600]   on the calendar.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.000]   And what do we need to do different today
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.160]   than we did yesterday?
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.440]   What do we need to do?
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.880]   How do we need to improve our schedule
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.040]   or our communication with one another, right?
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.520]   These are all forms of assessing in the moment.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.480]   - Yes, yes, good.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.440]   And that's the kind of assessing
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.800]   that we all are used to practicing every day in our homes.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.960]   Like you assess, do I have enough groceries
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.320]   to get through the rest of today?
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.000]   Do we have enough clean clothes
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.680]   that I don't have to do laundry now?
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.000]   Do we have all the supplies
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   for the never ending science fair project that is ongoing?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.240]   And then we have to troubleshoot what,
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.960]   okay, this didn't work last time.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.000]   How can I do this better?
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.680]   Right, I mean, my first time I did Memory Master
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.160]   with my oldest kids, that was a painful process.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.880]   But then I had to assess, okay,
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.840]   how can I make this less painful for my next student
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.680]   because I see the value in it.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.160]   And how can I bring rest to them and myself
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.600]   through the process, not to mention the daily assessment
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.200]   of you need to work on this, right?
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.160]   This is a subject you're struggling in.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.760]   - This is your growing edge.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.240]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.480]   But there's a lot more to assessment
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.200]   than just what grade did I get or what have I done wrong?
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.640]   Because I remember years ago,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.320]   Lee Bortons made the comment that has stuck out to me.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.760]   I don't even know when or where she said it,
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.680]   but she said there were four things to consider
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.120]   when you have a problem.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.960]   One is, do they know the information, right?
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.480]   Is their grammar down?
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.640]   The second is, do they understand it?
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.000]   Are the pieces practiced well enough
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.800]   for the understanding to have come?
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.520]   The third would be, can they express it?
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.960]   Maybe they do know and understand,
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.360]   but they don't know how to articulate it to you.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.240]   Or the fourth thing,
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.680]   maybe they're having some heart issues,
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.400]   some character issues, and if that's the case,
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.160]   put the books down and go deal
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.920]   with the hearts of your children.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.600]   And that has always resonated with me
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   because assessing where the heart of my student is
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.480]   is actually probably the number one thing
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.840]   I'm paying attention to
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.120]   when I'm encountering assessment with my students.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:41.960]   - And you know what?
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.360]   When your students are your children,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.200]   that's actually the number one concern of most of us.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.360]   Most of us started homeschooling our children
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.040]   because we want them to know how to love the Lord
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.760]   and love their family and love their community,
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.960]   their heart issues that we felt like nobody could do
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.440]   or care about as much as we did.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.000]   - Right, right.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.520]   And so sometimes though,
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.240]   even being able to see what a heart issue is
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.840]   is something that has to be practiced
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.040]   and discerned by the spirit, right?
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.280]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.240]   - Is my student ready for whatever it is
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.680]   that I think they're ready for?
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.600]   Is this what God has for them
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.520]   or is this my plan for them?
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.680]   - Yeah, is it just what I think is next
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.280]   in the scheme of things, right?
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.120]   - Yes.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.480]   Who is dictating what is next
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.520]   or where my student should end up, right?
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.400]   Is it the Holy Spirit or is it a governing body
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.160]   of a local school department
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.520]   who's telling me what I have to have or not have?
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.040]   And I'm not saying those things are not important.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.880]   - Right.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.080]   - But they need to be questions that I've considered
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.800]   when I'm thinking about assessing.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.120]   - Yeah, it's not a knee jerk.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.920]   It's not a knee jerk decision.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.000]   It's not, that's what the state says
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.320]   so that's what I have to do
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.320]   or that's what everybody else in our community is doing
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.600]   so that's what I have to do
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.280]   or even that's what I did with my older child
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.680]   so that's what I have to do.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.080]   - Exactly and we all struggle with that one really easily.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:14.920]   - Oh, yes.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.560]   - Comparing, even if it's not to an older child,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.000]   perhaps it's to another child in their classroom, right?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.360]   - Right, right.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.840]   - Oh, my student's not performing the same way.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.000]   I remember a good friend of mine,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.960]   her name is Kelly Hendricks
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.680]   and her oldest is the same age as my oldest
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.760]   and they were, excuse me, not my oldest, my son.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.120]   Her son is the same age as my son
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.600]   and they were in a Besidarian class together as four-year-olds
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.960]   and they were the only two boys in this Besidarian class.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.840]   - Oh, my goodness.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.680]   - They could barely talk
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.800]   and it was like cycle one ancients, you know,
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.640]   all those big words.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.080]   - Yes, all the big words, yes.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.760]   - And our little boys couldn't even talk.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.120]   These girls were doing circles around them
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.440]   and I remember feeling like, oh, oh no, my son,
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.280]   what's wrong with him?
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.160]   That he can't say all the things that I would compare.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.160]   - Yes, because you don't know any better at that stage.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.200]   - You don't, you don't.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.960]   And I mean, we do intellectually,
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.920]   but we end up still finding ourselves in that space, right?
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.640]   So it was really helpful to me because my friend Kelly,
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.120]   this was her younger children
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.800]   and so she was a little seasoned
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.360]   and ahead of me in the game
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.400]   and she's like, oh, Rachel, it's 'cause they're boys,
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.520]   they're gonna get it.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.520]   She was a real encouragement to me to put away those lies.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.280]   But I had to deal with, you know, assessing,
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.480]   you're assessing whether you think you are or not
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.960]   and responding out of those assessments.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.200]   But the truth is, is it a good assessment
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.240]   that I've come to a good conclusion?
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.880]   A truthful conclusion?
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.360]   Is it something that's blessing my student and myself, right?
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.720]   So these are questions that I have to ask myself.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.960]   If I'm entering into an assessment
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   and we are feeling feelings like guilt or shame
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:16.280]   or condemnation, then that's gonna be a clue to me.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.680]   I might not be assessing correctly.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.760]   Assessment is supposed to be joyful.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.400]   It is a celebration.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.640]   And if it doesn't feel like a celebration,
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.480]   it doesn't mean you're doing something wrong.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.880]   It means the assessment part just needs to be changed,
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.080]   assessed, it's in other words,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.880]   maybe how you're viewing the perspective
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   of how you're viewing needs to be changed,
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.560]   not the thing you're doing.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.480]   Gotcha.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.720]   Does that make sense?
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.760]   Might've been a little confusing there for a moment.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.760]   So the way that you are drawing your conclusions,
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.840]   it might not be the thing that you're doing that is bad.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.000]   It might just be the spin that you're putting on it
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   or the emphasis that you're putting on it or the pressure.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.080]   Yeah, gotcha.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.280]   Or the lens you're looking out of, right?
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.160]   Because if we're motivated by fear,
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.680]   then that fear is going to give us a view
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.600]   that fear is never joyful.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.960]   Right, and it's gonna be very constricting.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.000]   If we, whenever I make motions
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.200]   that are motivated by fear,
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.600]   I move in a very constricted manner.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.840]   Exactly.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.600]   And how many parents I've talked to,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.960]   they're like, well, I'm considering,
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.520]   which this is an assessment, they're drawing.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.360]   I'm considering taking my kids out of homeschooling
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.600]   and I just can't do this anymore.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.920]   I'm doing a poor job and I don't wanna fail them.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.560]   These sentiments are usually,
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.880]   I mean, they're fear-based sentiments
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.120]   and we all can identify with those feelings
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.600]   at one time or another.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.800]   I mean, how many of us said,
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.480]   you want me to take you and put you on a school bus?
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.040]   'Cause I'll take you and put you on a school bus, right?
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.720]   We're having lunch with my friends.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.880]   My life could be easier than this.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.000]   Right, I know.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.360]   When people ask me, they're like,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.360]   oh, do you like home?
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.840]   What's the best thing about homeschooling?
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.200]   I'm like, the best thing about homeschooling
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.960]   is I get to be with my kids all day long.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.800]   And they're like,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.960]   oh, what's the worst thing about homeschooling?
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.680]   Oh, I have to be with my kids all day long.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.800]   (laughing)
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.520]   I always, and people would say,
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   oh, isn't that terrible?
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.080]   I'm like, no, my kids would say the same thing.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.800]   The best thing is that we get to be home
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.280]   with mom and dad all day.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.320]   But the worst thing is that we're always home
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.160]   with mom and dad.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.680]   It just is a perspective thing.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.280]   Exactly, it really is.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.200]   And so when I hear a mom saying that,
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.040]   usually it's like,
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.640]   that's an invitation to me to encourage them,
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.960]   to help maybe change the lens they're looking out of.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.800]   Right?
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.600]   And it may be that the Lord would lead somebody
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.880]   to make different decisions than they're making.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.960]   But the thing is,
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.040]   is we want to not allow our assessments
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.680]   to be led by fear,
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.600]   which is never from God, right?
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.440]   Never from God.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.280]   Yes, very good.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.480]   That is very good.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.960]   So let me ask you this,
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.040]   because we titled this podcast,
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.600]   "The Gentle Joy of Assessment,"
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.720]   and I could feel people all over the world
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.240]   rolling their eyes.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.720]   Can assessment be gentle and joyous?
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.640]   Yes.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.480]   Well, okay.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.560]   I absolutely think they can be gentle and joyous.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.160]   And I have changed how I interact with my children now.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.520]   Ooh, tell me about that.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.520]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.040]   So, okay, let me give you an example.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.760]   If I have, I walk into the kitchen,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.840]   and this probably can resonate with many other parents.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.920]   If you walk into the kitchen
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.120]   and you had assigned a job to clean the kitchen,
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.600]   right, to your children.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.440]   Right.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.200]   And I walk in and it is halfway done,
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.960]   or maybe not even done at all,
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.080]   or I can see they did something,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.600]   but they're not even in the kitchen anymore.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.360]   They're distracted and off doing something else.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.600]   My first reaction, my old reaction,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.040]   would have been to assess,
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.960]   where are you getting this kitchen?
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.600]   You're not cleaning the kitchen.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.440]   It's dirty.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.760]   You have done a poor job.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.400]   You're not listening to me.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.440]   I may have even attacked motive.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.440]   You don't even care that the kitchen is clean, right?
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:46.480]   So that initial response of how I'm walking
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.720]   into that assessment immediately puts my children
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.840]   on defensive.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.040]   It's not joyful.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.160]   It's not gentle.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.920]   It's not kind, right?
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.760]   And so-
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.400]   Definitely not a celebration.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.840]   Not a celebration, exactly, okay?
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.640]   And so now, with learning these assessment skills
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.280]   and how to change assessment,
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.640]   I, and I'm not saying I do it perfect every time, Lisa.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.680]   Let me tell you that's the truth.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.080]   Right, right.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.960]   This is, it really has changed how I interact
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.080]   with my children, even on a day-to-day basis.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.560]   I may come in now and say,
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.560]   okay, well done on how you wiped the counters,
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.000]   and I see that you loaded the dishwasher.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.240]   I really appreciate that.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.640]   You did a good job.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.880]   Is there anything else that you did not do
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.240]   that needed to have been done?
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.520]   And by walking my student into self-assessment,
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.440]   I'm able to actually engage and see
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.520]   where my student is in their heart.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.640]   If they go, yeah, I did it all, it's fine.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.320]   Okay. Right, right.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   Where's the list of where you're,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.680]   what all the things you're supposed to do, right?
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.520]   Can you help me and walk me through each thing that you did?
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.600]   And I'm able to gauge, is my child's heart
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.960]   not in a good place, and then that's the place
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.600]   we need to deal with it?
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.240]   Or is it that they don't understand, right?
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.080]   My instructions. Right.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.640]   Right, that it means something different to them
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.120]   than it means to you.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.640]   This abuses me. Exactly.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.560]   Not quite communicating it to them.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.000]   Right, and honestly, it may be that I need to say,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.240]   okay, that was poor communication on my part.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.040]   I need to do a better job of instructing this area
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.280]   of what I expected to be done.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.360]   Let's try that again.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.320]   And let me even actually, I'm gonna show you, right?
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.960]   And I'm gonna model for them the kind of level of cleaning
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.520]   I'm hoping to get, right, out of that job.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.520]   So when I change the way I have learned how to assess
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.240]   in the classroom has actually spilled out
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.680]   and changed the way I parent as well.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.920]   I love that.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.480]   I love that because I was gonna ask you,
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.200]   and I may still ask you again in a minute,
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   what good is learning to assess well for life,
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.760]   not just for classroom?
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.800]   So keep going.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.640]   Yes. It's great.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.920]   Yes, and it actually changes how I interact with everyone,
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.040]   even my spouse and my marriage, right?
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.080]   If I, how many of us jump to wrong conclusions,
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.760]   wrong assessments in the people we love most,
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.280]   and we do not approach the conversation or questions
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.880]   with hospitality or consideration
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.840]   of the other person's feelings.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.680]   And I think that's a strategy of the enemy, honestly, Lisa,
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.920]   is to create division between us,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.040]   for us to just look through the wrong lenses
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.920]   and to jump to quick conclusions
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.760]   that needed to have taken the time to reflect.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.920]   Yes.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.680]   And I'm telling you, if you learn how to assess to bless,
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.920]   you will not only bless your students
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.200]   and your family and your coworkers,
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.960]   but you're going to engage in a different,
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.280]   it actually takes a lot of heat off of you
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.960]   because the first step of assessment
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.640]   is walking someone else into self-assessment.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.960]   Yes, that's beautiful.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.800]   It's key.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.320]   It is so key.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.680]   Because if I, I mean, if you think about it,
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.560]   God did this all the time, all the time in scripture.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.080]   Jesus did it and God did it.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.480]   Jesus is known to be the master teacher of questions, right?
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.840]   Yes, yes.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.520]   That draws you, it draws the listener into the process.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.240]   It's not just a lecture, it becomes a conversation.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.240]   And there are two of us now thinking about this,
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.800]   not one of us thinking and talking and one of us listening.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.880]   Exactly, and I think one of the big reasons
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.240]   why Jesus would ask those questions is to say,
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.960]   "Okay, where's the heart of this person?"
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.720]   Like, it makes me think about that one parable where,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.640]   and you might have to help me
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.280]   'cause I'm thinking off the top of my head here,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.120]   but there was a guy who, he came and he said,
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.680]   "What must I do to follow you?"
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.560]   Right?
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.600]   And Jesus was like, "Go and sell all of your," you know,
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.440]   he asked him--
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.720]   Everything you have and give it to the poor.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.720]   Yeah, "Are you able to do that?"
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.120]   Or, "What's the greatest commandment?"
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.360]   I can't even remember exactly,
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.240]   but he asked questions that grew,
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.000]   he like basically walked this man on a journey of thinking.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.600]   And then it got to the point where
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.200]   they're now both where Jesus wanted him to be.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.440]   And he said, "Okay, now go and sell all your stuff."
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.280]   Right.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.480]   And the guy, he had assessed
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.400]   that there was an idol in his life, right?
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.160]   But he had, and the command that he gave him,
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.920]   "Go do this," create, it says that he left very sad.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.560]   Right, because I think he realized for the first time,
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.840]   "Oh, there's something in me that's not ready to give in."
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.920]   Yes, yes.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.080]   And then Jesus was able to, you know,
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.520]   and there was a time of reflection
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.880]   that it caused him to have to go and say,
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.600]   "Am I willing to do that?
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.080]   "I don't know if I am."
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.680]   And sometimes it doesn't mean you're evil
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.120]   'cause you're not ready to do that.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.280]   It's an invitation by God to say,
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.400]   "Well, let me heal that part in you
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.920]   "so that you could be ready," right?
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.560]   Well, and I think it's a way for us to acknowledge
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.920]   that there's a roadblock.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.280]   There's a roadblock in us.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.280]   This is why I'm not getting traction on this.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.880]   This is why I can't move ahead.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.480]   This is why I'm not doing better.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.560]   There's this problem, and you asking me that question
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.280]   forced me to identify that that's the roadblock right there.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.120]   Exactly. That's why I'm not better.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:55.120]   Exactly, and my old person would say,
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.640]   "Oh, you're just being lazy," right?
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.880]   And I don't really agree that children are lazy.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   I believe that fear in our children causes them,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.600]   and humans, all humans, not just children,
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.360]   but fear causes humans to do one of two things.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.200]   It causes them to either overwork, right?
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.600]   Perfectionist, driven by fear to not get something wrong,
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.360]   so I'm gonna do it all, which I remember, Lisa,
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.520]   you said I was a good girl who-
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.440]   Yeah, that was definitely my motivation, yeah.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.280]   Okay, so I'm the opposite side,
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.480]   whereas you were maybe motivated by that.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:38.440]   I would be fearful, and it would paralyze me,
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.560]   and I wouldn't be able to do things,
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.480]   and it looked as if I didn't care, but I wasn't doing them,
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.200]   but I did care.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.960]   Right, you just had no idea where to start
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.800]   because you were so overwhelmed.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.520]   Yes, and I really believe that if you have a student
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.000]   who is struggling with just not,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   and I hear this from parents all over the place,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.680]   we have an easier time dealing with a kid
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.000]   who's a perfectionist, who's driven, self-motivated,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.320]   but self-condemns constantly, right?
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.640]   Yes, yes.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.880]   We, as parents, that's easier for us
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.720]   'cause all the boxes are getting checked,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.880]   but the student who's not, who's paralyzed
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.160]   and not able to do the things they're doing,
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.480]   but the truth is, both sides of the coins are not good,
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.320]   right?
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:31.160]   Yes, exactly, they both need us in very definite ways.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.240]   Exactly, and so we get to assess by asking questions
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.560]   to help them identify what is the motivating factor
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.600]   of me feeling like I need to do eight hours of school
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:47.200]   in a day or having a hard time accomplishing
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.600]   a single seminar, right, and my thing.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.520]   And so assessment is, first and foremost,
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.520]   asking and walking our students into self-assessment,
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.560]   just like God did.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.240]   Where were you when I formed the earth, right?
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.680]   I mean, God did it all throughout the Old Testament
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.440]   and the New Testament, so we can take that.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.120]   I mean, God, He knew the answers, right?
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.240]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.560]   Sometimes, now we're not God, and as parents,
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.240]   we might actually not know the answer.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.120]   Sometimes we think we know the answer,
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.800]   and then they answer, our children can respond
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.960]   with different things that surprise us, right?
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.800]   Yes, yes.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.840]   So I feel like by walking, learning how to assess
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:37.120]   in this way, you're actually practicing humility
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.440]   by saying, I think I know, but maybe I don't know,
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.720]   and I'm gonna ask the questions first,
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.280]   and I'm gonna walk my student into a space
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.840]   and make sure they're ready for what I think
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.240]   they're ready for, but maybe they're not.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.680]   It's worth asking the questions.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   And asking the question makes you a partner
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.720]   with your learner, and it is so much better.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.880]   We've both already said it.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.400]   It is so much better to walk arm in arm with a partner
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.840]   than to walk along by yourself.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:17.480]   And so you have automatically, by becoming a partner
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.520]   in learning with your child, by asking them questions,
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.960]   you have opened their heart to you
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.320]   in a way it would not have been open otherwise.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.360]   Exactly, and you know, that's actually what acidity,
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.880]   which is the Latin word for assessment,
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.160]   that's actually what it means.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.280]   It means to walk beside.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.120]   Yep.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.680]   And to walk beside, not above,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:44.040]   where we are lording over them, not below,
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:48.280]   where we are cowering under them, but beside them,
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.080]   where we are partnering with our students,
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.000]   acknowledging the humanity that is within them,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.200]   that they are made in the image of God, just like we are,
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.720]   and that we have value as the stewards over them.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.080]   How many times do we make the comments, Lisa?
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.760]   These are my children.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.600]   Yes.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.920]   And I have been convicted, Lord, these are not my children.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.800]   These are your children.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.880]   Yes.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.840]   These belong to my master,
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   and I have been given the great responsibility.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.720]   Thankfully, it is tied to love, right?
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.240]   And it's only because of His Spirit we can even love.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.240]   But it's tied to, okay, thank you, Lord,
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.240]   I love these people, and I want to steward them well for you.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:39.040]   And that means I want to assess well.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.600]   I want to assess in a way that honors you, Lord,
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   that brings joy, and that honors the person in front of me.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.560]   And I would say that assessing with joy
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.040]   means to honor the human in front of you.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.560]   And to honor someone, like when we say phrases
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.320]   like in a courtroom, right?
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.320]   We say your honor to the judge.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.440]   Yes.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:11.440]   We would never say things to a literal judge in a courtroom
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.280]   the way we say things to our own children.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.240]   You're right.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.600]   We would never do that, and we're all guilty of it,
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.160]   myself for sure included, right?
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:27.240]   And so by learning how to practice this assessment,
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:32.360]   you're practicing way bigger things
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:37.120]   than what do I need to do to get this schoolwork done,
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.800]   or finish the school year,
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.600]   or finish their homeschool career.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.720]   Okay, listeners, I have good news and bad news, okay?
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.400]   The bad news is we've run out of time for today.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.920]   The good news is our very next session
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.120]   with Rachel will be in one week,
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.320]   and we are gonna talk about how do we assess
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:06.000]   now that the Lord has given us this new vision,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.880]   perhaps, of assessment as celebration,
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.000]   and the purpose of assessment
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.760]   to draw, to honor the human in front of you,
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.080]   and to draw yourself and your student,
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.600]   your child into partnership
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:28.600]   as you help them take up the reins of self-assessment.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.080]   And as we have really become perhaps convicted
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.600]   that our assessment needs to change
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.200]   in order to become gentle, and joyful,
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.880]   and spiritually edifying to the whole family,
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.520]   how are we gonna do this?
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.600]   Rachel is gonna walk us through
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.600]   how do we assess in our homeschool next time.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.600]   And Rachel, I wanna also,
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.400]   I want you to speak for a minute,
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.160]   because listeners, Rachel has a conference
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.240]   that she leads that I'd love for her to tell you about,
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.800]   because if you want to hear more about this,
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.600]   and you want an avenue perhaps to practice
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.320]   some of these tools of assessing,
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.800]   Rachel might have just the thing you need.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.080]   Rachel, tell us about your conference.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.000]   - Oh, thank you, Lisa, yes.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.120]   Please join me for the next
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.000]   Tools for Transcripts online conference.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.360]   It's gonna be February 13th, 18th, and 20th
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.320]   at 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.160]   It is presented by Classical Tools for Change,
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.000]   and it's taught by myself.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.280]   And we're gonna delve into the depths of assessment,
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.120]   exploring the answers to questions like,
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.240]   what is the nature of assessment?
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.840]   Who is being assessed?
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.720]   What is being assessed?
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.440]   Who are the assessors?
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.720]   What is the purpose of assessment?
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.240]   And what are some forms of assessment?
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.440]   It is a three-part conference
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.760]   where we were gonna converse through ideas in part one,
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.120]   we're gonna practice the skills of assessment in part two,
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.720]   and then we're gonna walk through the logistics
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.520]   of crafting a transcript in part three.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.160]   So you can find more information
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.000]   at www.classicaltoolsforchange.com,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.360]   and that's for the number four.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.440]   Again, the dates are February 13th, 18th, and 20th,
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.480]   but I do add new dates every month.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.600]   So check our website for those dates as they come.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.560]   And I appreciate you, Lisa,
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.520]   just giving me this opportunity to come
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.400]   and discuss some of my favorite topics.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.720]   - Well, I have loved reconnecting,
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.440]   but I've really loved thinking about this whole idea
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.320]   of the connection between Sabbath and assessment
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:48.320]   and how assessment can be gentle and joyful
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:53.280]   and also honoring to the people with whom we practice it.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.720]   So thank you, Rachel.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.120]   Listeners, I hope that this has given you enough
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.720]   to think about that you'll be busy until next week
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.200]   when we'll see you again.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.520]   All right, bye-bye, you guys.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.100]   (gentle music)
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.160]   you
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.220]   you
