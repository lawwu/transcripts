[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340]   I'm not teaching good side of life.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.140]   So I had to figure out a way when I came on in 2016 of teaching you what life
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.780]   really is for the majority of us is hell.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.740]   And so while people love to show you the cars and the house and
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.380]   the vacations and shit, all that's good, all that's happy.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.820]   I'm gonna show you the side that I know most of you are going through.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.340]   And people hide very well.
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.780]   I don't want to hide anymore.
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.540]   I hid for 24 fucking years.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.940]   That's why now I told you, we can talk about whatever you want.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.420]   Because as human beings, the first thing we have to learn,
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.300]   I also stuttered real bad growing up.
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.180]   So if you hear me stutter every now and then,
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.060]   it's because that was part of my life also.
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.300]   So it's funny, human beings want to show you the best side, and
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.180]   they want to hide the worst side.
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.620]   For me, I'm gonna teach you how to be vulnerable.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.140]   Cuz that's the only way you fix yourself.
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.980]   You don't fix yourself by coming out here and me selling you some fucking books.
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.020]   That's why I don't have them, I forgot them.
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.220]   I'm glad people got something from the book.
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.780]   I want you to learn that the only way you grow is how to look at yourself and
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.460]   say, okay, like I did, table longer than this.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.100]   What the fuck I have to do to get somewhere?
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.940]   There was nothing good on there, nothing.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.420]   Yeah, I love playing basketball, I left that out.
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.300]   That's something I love to do.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.460]   I don't care about that, that didn't make the fucking list.
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.540]   Cuz the list that I had to live by was the very list that was to get me
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.300]   at this table with you, to talk to you,
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.460]   to the normal human beings which I once was, about how you can get somewhere.
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.220]   And how it looks, looks very ugly.
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.540]   There's no fucking passion, no fucking motivation, there's no, my God, man,
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.500]   I fucking, this is, no, it's every day of your life just doing.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.420]   No passion, no discipline, no motivation, all these words, I hate people,
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.460]   I hate that so many people fucking use these words now cuz it's watered.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.260]   It's someone sitting in a room by themselves and
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.660]   they figure themselves out and say, God, this is gonna fucking suck.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.140]   Where's passion when you're 300 pounds?
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.820]   Where's the motivation when you can't read and write?
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.940]   Where is it?
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.780]   So how did this happen?
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.180]   I just fucking did, I just did.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.860]   I said, maybe at the end of this journey, there'll be something there for me.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.340]   If not, I can read, if not, I'm 185 fucking pounds.
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.100]   There's no magic potion, there's no, let me wake up and look at some shit, no.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.780]   All those words are overused, they're bullshit, it's all bullshit, just do.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.380]   You're living, how do you wanna live?
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.860]   How do you wanna die?
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.380]   How do you wanna fucking be remembered?
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.380]   That's it, that's it, period.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.180]   >> The word haunted is ringing in my head.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.380]   >> Yep.
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.540]   >> I think it's such a powerful word.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.300]   >> Yep.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.940]   >> Because I was about to say, it seems like a huge part of your process,
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.100]   maybe the entire process is it's all stick, no carrot.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.300]   You talk about the carrot, the positive thing, and
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.220]   then there's the stick, the thing you're trying to avoid.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.060]   >> Yep.
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.140]   >> Feel like it's, the way it's landing for me is, it's all stick and gas pedal.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.820]   >> That's it.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.380]   >> There's no carrot.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.380]   You're not imagining, when I'm a paramedic, when the book is published.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.740]   And obviously you set those goals and you make those targets.
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.260]   >> Yep.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.540]   >> But it's all stick.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.900]   >> All stick.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.540]   >> No carrot.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.980]   >> Think about that.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.740]   I'm waking up right now, studying, I have a test tomorrow.
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.860]   I already passed the fucking test.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.940]   Think about that.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.260]   Every day of my life, that's what I must do just to retain what I learned.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.820]   Four hours plus a day, I go through and do that.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.900]   There's no stick, or there's only a stick.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.660]   There's never been a carrot.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.900]   Which is why, when I speak to people,
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.660]   I have to figure out a way to resonate with them.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.300]   Because all I want to say to them is, let me teach you the real life.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.060]   How it really is.
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.140]   The reason why you're a loser, and the reason why you're not fucking making it.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.900]   And the reason why you're trying to go through all these,
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.420]   I go to all these fucking conventions.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.460]   Speak all the fucking time.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.060]   I look in the fucking audience, and these people sign up, sign up, sign up.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.020]   Fucking every year, go to convention.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.100]   Thinking they're gonna learn something fucking different.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.380]   No, you're lazy, you know exactly what to do, exactly what to do.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.100]   Cuz even me, in my state of, I can't read or write, I knew exactly what to do.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.060]   It just sucks doing it.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.260]   It sucks to do it.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.300]   It sucks to wake up every morning of your life and say, God, man, I'm not smart.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.380]   So guess what I gotta do?
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.540]   I gotta study the same shit that I got one of the highest scores in the nation on.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.700]   And do it again, do it again, do it again.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.780]   It's not just there, it's not just there permanently for me.
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.420]   So yeah, it's all stick, it's all stick.
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.060]   The only care that you have is like, maybe, maybe.
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.220]   Cuz whenever I take these tests that are real hard, in the back of my brain,
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.820]   it's like, there's a good chance you're not gonna make it, Goggins.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.580]   This ain't you, bro, this ain't you, you weren't born like this.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.700]   This ain't you, the real you, bro, study all you want to.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.060]   But the second that fucking computer comes on with 150 questions, this ain't you, man.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.820]   Somehow, comes back, I passed, I passed again, passed again.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.700]   But that real me back here every fucking time is saying, that ain't you, bro.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.740]   That ain't you, and I have to outwork that voice.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.380]   When I'm taking that test and I get to a question, I don't fucking know the answer.
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.380]   I'm like, fuck, man.
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.660]   And then say, I told you, man, that ain't you, you're 300 pounds, man.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.300]   You sit at home, you figure out how to do your hair, that's what you do.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.860]   How to come to school with the reverse baldness when you're 16, that's you.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.620]   So there is no get out of jail free card.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.340]   This is why I say stay hard.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.820]   Because when you weren't given the gifts,
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.460]   the only thing you can do in life is stay hard.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.860]   And I know people cannot stand me, they can't stand this talk.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:11.740]   This is all you can do, there's no magic pill or a magic potion.
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:18.140]   All you can do is outwork the man that God created or woman in you.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.460]   And what that looks like is unfun.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.060]   That's why I said, do not do a documentary on me.
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.460]   Because people will not see the truth.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:34.300]   They will see what they wanna see is, I don't wanna live like that, good, good.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.740]   And you will live exactly the way you live now, questioning who you are,
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.380]   wondering what is possible, wondering what you are capable of doing.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.300]   That's how that looks, or you can be me, which, am I happy?
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.820]   I don't know, never thought about it, don't really care about it.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.180]   Cuz all I really cared about was when I looked in that fucking mirror,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.100]   I saw a piece of shit.
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.340]   Happiness wasn't on the mirror at 16, or I was 300 pounds.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.140]   It wasn't like, I'm looking for happiness.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.860]   No, I'm looking at myself in the mirror and say, all right,
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.100]   motherfuck, you did it again today.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.460]   You're a bad boy, cuz that shit sucks.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.980]   I have about a couple minutes of that, when I got the carrot.
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.940]   The second I lay down to go to bed, the carrot's gone,
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.860]   because I'm waking up all through the night to check the work I did that day.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.380]   Did I get this drug right?
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.220]   Did I get this right?
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:27.980]   Did I get that right?
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.980]   What did I do?
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.620]   My God, fuck, I'm already losing it, it's a stick.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:42.840]   [MUSIC]
