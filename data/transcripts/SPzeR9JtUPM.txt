[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   [silence]
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.220]   We know that one of the things
[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.860]   that can trigger the onset of puberty,
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.900]   in particular in females,
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.420]   is that when enough body fat accumulates,
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.860]   that body fat releases a hormone called leptin.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.580]   And that hormone leptin travels in the bloodstream
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.880]   across the blood-brain barrier
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.420]   and goes to the hypothalamus
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.020]   and can trigger the onset of puberty
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.060]   by activating the neurons
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.720]   that release gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.380]   So many people believe that one of the reasons
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.880]   that puberty is happening earlier and earlier in females
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.340]   is because of the accumulation of more body fat
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.260]   at younger ages than was observed 30 or 40
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.020]   and certainly 100 years ago.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.740]   Now, I can already imagine a number of people are thinking,
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.980]   oh, this must relate to the obesity crisis.
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860]   And indeed, there is a crisis of obesity.
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.860]   Obesity is something that is causing all sorts of problems
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.140]   with people's health at various levels, brain and body,
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.780]   and that is far more frequent today
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.820]   than it was even 20 years ago.
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.200]   So it is indeed a crisis
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.440]   because it has enormous detrimental effects
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.420]   for so many aspects of brain and body health and longevity.
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.900]   But this whole process of thinking about body fat
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.460]   signaling leptin to the hypothalamus
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.340]   and the onset of puberty
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.500]   doesn't necessarily have to do with the obesity crisis.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.060]   It might relate, but it could also relate to,
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.500]   for instance, improved nutrition,
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.380]   which is allowing body fat stores to accumulate,
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.140]   maybe not to the level of obesity, but to accumulate earlier
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.700]   and at younger ages in females,
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.460]   which is then causing earlier puberty in females.
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.780]   To just highlight how that might be possible,
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.180]   I want to review some data
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.700]   that talk about the onset of menses, menstruation,
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.220]   that is puberty, in females according to country
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.980]   and according to age over the last 100 or more years.
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.460]   So what are the general trends
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.240]   in terms of the onset of puberty in females?
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.020]   Well, that's an easy one to answer.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.160]   Over the last 100 years or so,
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.460]   the onset of puberty has been occurring much earlier
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.940]   with each passing decade.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.320]   It's really an incredible set of statistics.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.780]   I will provide a link to these data
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.100]   since I know a number of you are listening
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.780]   and not just watching on YouTube.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.500]   This is from a study in which the onset of puberty
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.300]   has been analyzed from as early as the 1850s, right?
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.660]   In certain countries, there are data on that,
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.500]   out to the 1970s and in other countries,
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.540]   starting at about 1900, extending out to about 1990.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.100]   These are ongoing collections of data,
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.500]   but just to give you a sense
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.140]   how the data are falling out
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.500]   in a couple of different countries,
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.220]   just to give you a flavor,
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.260]   but for those of you listening
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.340]   and for those of you watching,
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.500]   the essence of all of these findings
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.900]   is that puberty is happening much, much earlier
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.180]   with each passing decade.
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.640]   So for instance, in the United States,
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.140]   around 1900 or 1903, the average age of menarche,
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.140]   the onset of puberty in females was about 14 years old,
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.020]   whereas in 1990, the average age is 11.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.660]   So that's a pretty significant,
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.660]   we can say acceleration of the onset of puberty.
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.020]   Now, of course, these are averages,
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.460]   so there will be exceptions.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.660]   There's a distribution of data.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.100]   Today still, there will be young females
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.540]   who will undergo puberty at age 11 or 10,
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.900]   or maybe even nine and others who will undergo puberty
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.500]   at age 13, 14, maybe even 16 or 17.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.980]   However, if we look at, for instance,
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.460]   the data from Norway, which dates back quite far,
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.740]   they have excellent record keeping to 1850,
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.860]   what we see is that the average age
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.880]   of the onset of female puberty in 1850 in Norway
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.780]   was 17 years old,
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.780]   whereas in 1970, it's 13 years old.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.460]   So this is a dramatic acceleration of the onset of puberty.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.620]   And you see a similar trend in other countries as well.
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.180]   So if we were to look in, for instance, in the UK,
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.060]   they have a smaller data set,
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.820]   meaning it only extends back to about 1940,
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.300]   but the average age of the onset of puberty in the UK
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.740]   in 1940 was 13 and a half years old.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.720]   Again, this is just for females.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.580]   And in 1970, it was closer to 13
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.940]   with a trend towards declining even further.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.880]   Unfortunately, they didn't continue to collect data
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.900]   out to 2022.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.120]   And as a final point, if we were to look at,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.500]   for instance, in Germany and Finland,
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.040]   the average onset of puberty in 1870
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.020]   was 16 and a half years old.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.300]   By 1940, it was down to 13 and a half years old.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.340]   So all of these data have borne out over and over again,
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.020]   regardless of location in the world,
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.500]   which is important because when you start to think
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.900]   about the obesity crisis, you can say,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.940]   well, that's mainly in developed countries,
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.340]   believe it or not, or perhaps not surprisingly.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.580]   And maybe it has to do with the obesity crisis.
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.380]   And yet I don't think we can conclude that at all.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.380]   Something is happening, however.
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.220]   It could be increased body fat stores
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.700]   due to overeating and obesity.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.440]   However, it could also be unrelated to obesity.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.420]   It could be, for instance, improved nutrition
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.300]   and the availability of quality nutrition,
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.340]   which can signal the maturation
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.840]   of the brain and body mechanisms
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.080]   that trigger the onset of puberty,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.960]   ovulatory cycle, and menstruation.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.400]   So we want to be very careful about leaping to conclusions
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.640]   about what these trends mean,
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.820]   but the trends themselves are very, very apparent.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.740]   And as a final point, I should also mention
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.000]   that there are a number of different behavioral
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.160]   and psychosocial, as they're called,
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.720]   interactions that can influence puberty as well.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.720]   This has been most strikingly observed in animals.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.400]   And so I don't want anyone to be alarmed
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.240]   or to leap to any great conclusions
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.760]   about the onset of timing of puberty in humans,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.600]   but I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.520]   about a certain result which shows
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   that if a young female is exposed to the odor,
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.200]   not necessarily the pheromones, right?
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.800]   There's a distinction between odors that we perceive
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.880]   and pheromones, which are subconscious, right?
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.440]   That we don't actively perceive,
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.440]   but that can impact our biology.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.600]   And pheromone effects in humans are very controversial.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.600]   But we know, for instance, that if you take a female animal,
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.760]   and there's some evidence from humans
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.600]   that if you take a young pre-pubertal female
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.400]   and you expose her to the scent
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   of a reproductively competent male for a series of days,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.020]   but maybe even as short as a few hours,
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.740]   and she is also not regularly being exposed
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.780]   to the scent of her father,
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.080]   that she can undergo puberty earlier.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.920]   That's right.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.740]   There is something about the odor and/or pheromones,
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.920]   or perhaps something else that occurs
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.420]   when a young pre-pubertal female has a father
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.780]   that she's in regular contact with.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.240]   He wouldn't necessarily have to live at home,
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.820]   but that is around a lot, that his smell, excuse me,
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.860]   is registered by her biological systems.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.020]   That, I don't want to say protects,
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.180]   because it kind of skews the valence of the conversation,
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.180]   but that offsets or buffers the otherwise observed effect,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.900]   which is that the scent of a reproductively competent male,
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.140]   if it's present often enough, or perhaps intensely enough,
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.460]   that it can trigger the onset of puberty in that female.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.260]   In other words, the scent of a male that is not the father,
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.240]   and we think also that is not biologically related to her,
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.100]   can trigger earlier onset of puberty.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.580]   And that effect can at least be partially buffered
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.100]   by her being in the presence of the scent
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.100]   from her biological father.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.020]   Now, some of you are probably already leaping
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.540]   to conclusions about what this means.
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.300]   Should you not allow your daughter to be exposed
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.940]   to any males who are of reproductive age, et cetera?
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.860]   And that's certainly not what I'm saying.
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.300]   There's a huge number of considerations
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.780]   that go into that calculation for everybody
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.700]   and circumstances, et cetera.
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.160]   But the point is that the odors of individuals,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.400]   both related, in particular, closely related,
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.600]   and non-related individuals,
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.480]   can shape the neural systems and the hormone systems
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.000]   that can trigger the onset of puberty
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   or suppress the onset of puberty.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.580]   [upbeat music]
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.280]   (upbeat music)
