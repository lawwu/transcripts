[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Welcome to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.840]   We're back with guest Paul David Tripp,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.320]   the author of the book, "Awe, Why It Matters
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.720]   "for Everything We Think, Say, and Do."
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.400]   So this week we're talking about awe
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.700]   and how it really does relate to everything in life,
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.800]   specifically to our spiritual growth and our Bible intake,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.480]   our ministry aims, and even to our news consumption,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.880]   our weight loss attempts, our anxieties,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.080]   our parenting methods, and our expectations
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.920]   for marriage and romantic love.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.160]   We must be seduced by God, as you said on Monday.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.720]   He must capture our hearts.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.720]   This has ramifications for finding purpose
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.320]   and meaning in our lives, as we saw earlier.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.040]   This is essential for getting honest about weight loss
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.800]   and the care of our bodies, as we saw yesterday.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.800]   Today we turn now to talk about how to engender awe in God,
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.280]   in others, as a leading aim of our ministry labors.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880]   Paul, how has your own ministry been shaped
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480]   by this reality and this calling?
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.960]   - I love Psalm 145.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.960]   I say in the book that Psalm 145 changed my life
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.160]   and changed my ministry, because one day reading
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.160]   through Psalm 145, I all of a sudden got my calling.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160]   I think for the first time,
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.800]   I understood what I had been called to do.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.440]   And it's just a phrase that says,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.440]   "One generation shall commend your works to another."
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.520]   And I thought, there it is.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.920]   My job is to be used of God through the vehicle
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.160]   of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.800]   and the content of scripture,
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.400]   to give people back their awe of God again,
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   so that their hearts are now ruled by the awe of God.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.000]   So that claim on their hearts then begins
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.720]   to redirect everything in their lives.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.840]   Materialism isn't first a money problem.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.720]   Materialism is an awe problem.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.580]   If I'm not in awe of God, it's very, very possible
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.080]   for me to be in awe of physical things
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.480]   and spin myself into debt as a result.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.860]   Disobedience is not first a law problem.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.800]   It's an awe problem that leads to a law problem.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.520]   I mean, look at the 10 commandments.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.440]   The first commands are about worship,
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.760]   because if you don't keep those commands,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.700]   you won't be keeping the ones that follow.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.700]   And so in giving people their awe back again
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.440]   through the preaching of God's word,
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.440]   I give them the gift of a satisfied heart,
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.600]   which then gives them strength against the temptation
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.760]   that would say, "Here's where satisfaction could be found."
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.080]   - So good, yeah.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.360]   This single ministry aim of helping give people
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.480]   their awe in God again,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.480]   it really simplifies a lot of our discipleship
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.360]   and parenting, our preaching, our musical worship,
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.820]   our counseling, all of it.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.960]   But this really must begin first in our own hearts, though.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.760]   - Sure, and even your motivation as a minister.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.660]   I mean, look, if you're not in ministry
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.360]   with a heart that's satisfied in God's glory,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.720]   then you'll probably ask your ministry
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.320]   to give you identity, meaning, and purpose,
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.720]   and inner sense of well-being.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.600]   I have to say this, 'cause I've been in pastoral ministry
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   for many, many years.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.280]   A ministry is a miserable place to find your identity.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.240]   It just is.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.240]   And so I need to be freed from the bondage
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.920]   for looking to have this all capacity satisfied
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.800]   by creation just as much as anybody else
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.280]   in my ministry does.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.400]   - Yes.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.600]   So when Paul Tripp wants to recapture his own awe of God,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.000]   or when you want God to once again capture your heart,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   how do you do it?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.240]   Where do you go?
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.840]   - Let the Bible do it for you.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.100]   I think it's important to take people
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.040]   to those mind-numbing, heart-engaging,
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.160]   knee-weakening passages like Isaiah 40,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.680]   where the language, human language,
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.840]   is stretched to its furthest elasticity
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.520]   to try to capture the glory of God.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.080]   I mean, think of the physical picture
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.440]   of God holding the waters of the universe
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.680]   in the hollow of his hand.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.580]   Think of the majesty of that.
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.480]   I mean, how much liquid could you hold in your hand,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.680]   the palm of your hand, without it spilling?
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   That's just one illustration of the stunning glory of God.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.160]   Or the end of Job, where God has that,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.120]   "Where were you when the foundations of creation
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.640]   "were laid," conversation with Job,
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.920]   and displays his splendor.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.800]   Or Ephesians 1, where the redeeming plan of God
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.280]   throughout the ages is laid bare for us.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.120]   We need those passages.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.760]   We need to meditate in those passages.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.720]   We need to go back to those passages again and again.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.680]   And they do a much better job of capturing God's splendor
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.080]   than I would ever do.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.160]   - Amen, yes.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.760]   So speak to ministers now.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.720]   This is simplifying.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.160]   It is also incredibly daunting.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160]   They labor to inspire awe in others.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.480]   This is what you call in the book
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.960]   the grand agenda of all ministry.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.200]   I love that.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.560]   Speak to ministers who are lost in the details,
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.240]   or they're buried in criticism,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.800]   or they simply feel burned out
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.840]   from years of pouring their lives out.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.680]   How would you counsel ministers here?
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.680]   - I think in the press of the struggles,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.200]   trials, pressures, and discourages of ministry,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   there is counsel to be found for us in Psalm 27.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.640]   Psalm 27 is written in one of two
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.480]   of the most tragic experiences.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.600]   Either David was fleeing from Saul and gross injustice,
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.520]   or fleeing from his son Absalom,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.980]   who wanted his throne, a terrible family betrayal.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.920]   And in the midst of that, he says,
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   "One thing I desire, that I could dwell
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.760]   "in the house of the Lord
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.600]   "and gaze upon the beauty of the Lord."
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.640]   Now, why does he say that?
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.960]   Because he understands there's something
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.200]   that exists in the universe,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.280]   someone that exists in the universe,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.080]   who's way more glorious and way more beautiful
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.760]   than any ugly thing you will face in your ministry.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.120]   And you will only understand
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.880]   the struggles of ministry properly
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.320]   when you look at them through the stunning beauty,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.280]   awesome glory of the Lord.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.040]   Now, here's what that means.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.920]   It means you need to have a habit
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.240]   of getting up every morning as a pastor
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.200]   and gazing upon the beauty of the Lord.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   Go to one of those passages, let your heart take that in.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.680]   Rest in that.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.880]   And why can you rest in that?
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.320]   Because what the Bible teaches us
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.240]   is all that God is in his glory,
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.400]   he is for us by grace.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.320]   He has unleashed his glory on us by grace.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.400]   So that beauty not only tells me who God is,
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.040]   it redefines me as one of God's children.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.180]   And then, now you're ready to go out
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.040]   and do your ministry,
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.480]   but now not doing it hoping for greater acceptance
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.420]   and greater success.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.680]   Now you go out with your heart satisfied
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.200]   and you're free to give
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.760]   what has filled your heart to others.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.200]   - Finally, what would you say to a pastor
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.040]   who knows that they should preach awe in God,
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.720]   but they don't feel it privately?
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.320]   Is the public preaching of God's awesomeness
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.540]   disingenuous when a minister
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.900]   doesn't experience that awe privately?
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.680]   - I don't think there's ever a moment in preaching
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.940]   where you do not preach truth as a poor example of truth.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.120]   I mean, what pastor has ever preached a passage
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.200]   saying to himself, "I perfectly example this"?
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.040]   No one.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:36.160]   And so, I'm always a broken tool
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.000]   I love what it says in 2 Corinthians 4
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   that we are cracked vessels
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.920]   so that the light of God's glory shows through.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.320]   I mean, that's all of us.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.480]   And so I get up, I confess my inadequacy,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.880]   I confess my inconsistency,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.000]   and I luxuriate in God's forgiveness
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.020]   and in the gospel irrationality
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.500]   that he can actually use someone like me
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.260]   to declare his glory.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.180]   - Yeah, very good.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.220]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.360]   We're gonna return tomorrow
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.980]   and transition to talk about awe and parenting.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.020]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.180]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.520]   with guest Paul Tripp.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.620]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:40.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
