[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.160]   Psalm 36, "In your light we see light," for the choir director of the servant of Yahweh,
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.520]   of David.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.240]   Transgression declares to the ungodly within his heart.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.440]   There is no dread of God before his eyes, for it flatters him in his eyes for one to
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.720]   discover his iniquity and hate it.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.300]   The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit.
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.940]   He has ceased to consider to do good.
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.240]   He devises wickedness upon his bed.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.600]   He sets himself on a path that is not good.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.920]   He does not despise evil.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.640]   Your love and kindness, O Yahweh, is in the heavens.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.480]   Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.520]   Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.960]   Your judgments are like a great deep.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.160]   O Yahweh, you save man and beast.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.040]   How precious is your love and kindness, O God.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.080]   And the sons of men take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.260]   They're satisfied from the richness of your house, and you give them to drink of the river
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.460]   of your delight, for with you is the fountain of life.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.160]   In your light we see light.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.960]   Continue your loving kindness to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.880]   in heart.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.840]   Let not the foot of pride come upon me, and let not the hand of the ungodly drive me away.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.720]   There the workers of wickedness have fallen.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.160]   They have been thrust down and cannot rise.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.160]   Amen.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.160]   Amen.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.160]   Amen.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.220]   you
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:00.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
