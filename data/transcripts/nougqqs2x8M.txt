[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.220]   Do our past sins work together for our future good?
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.340]   It's a question from two different listeners today.
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.680]   Tim is one of them.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.920]   Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.800]   Paul writes in Romans 8.28,
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.700]   and we know that all things work together for good to them
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.960]   that love God to them who are the called
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.700]   according to his purpose.
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.360]   I know that all things includes the so-called bad things
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.040]   as well, like suffering and death.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.000]   However, I'm confused as to whether the all things
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.600]   also includes my specific sins.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.680]   A similar question came in to us from Cliff.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.320]   Pastor John, can you explain something?
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.720]   Does the all in the all things of Romans 8.28 include my sin?
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.960]   I hate my sin.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.920]   I long for the day I won't sin.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.640]   But is my sin too working for an eternal good in me?
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.480]   Pastor John, how would you answer Tim and Cliff?
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.280]   - Well, before I answer directly,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.840]   which I hope to do,
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.520]   let me lay down a biblical warning
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.520]   because Paul is very much aware of a danger
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520]   in answering this question with a yes,
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.520]   namely that our sins can do work together
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.920]   for our eternal good.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.240]   He sees a danger and he warns against it at least twice.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.480]   So that's where I feel like I should start.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.840]   So here's the first one, Romans 3.5.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.360]   If our unrighteousness serves to show
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.400]   the righteousness of God,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400]   what should we say?
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.840]   That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us?
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.960]   By no means, for then how could God judge the world?
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.960]   But if through my lie, God's truth abounds to his glory,
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.400]   why am I still condemned as a sinner?
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   And why not do evil that good may come
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.240]   as some people slanderously charge us with saying
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.240]   their condemnation is just?
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.240]   In other words, Paul is very aware of the danger
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.280]   that in answering this question,
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.880]   I might lead people to do,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.120]   what here is the quote,
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.600]   do evil that good may come.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.240]   And he says, and I say,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   anybody who infers that from anything I'm gonna say now,
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.960]   from me or from Paul,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.580]   they're making a slanderous charge.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.160]   I am never going to say,
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.800]   let's all do evil that good may come
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.920]   since he turns all of our evil for his glory
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.700]   and for our good.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.140]   That's the first warning.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.140]   Here's the second one from Romans 5.20-6.2.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.000]   The law came in to increase the trespass,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.360]   but where sin increased,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.320]   grace abounded all the more.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.120]   So that as sin reigned in death,
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.940]   grace also might reign through righteousness,
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.520]   leading to eternal life through Jesus our Lord.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.520]   What shall we say then?
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.520]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.780]   By no means.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.380]   How can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.740]   In other words,
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.740]   if we use our presumed human logic to say
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.860]   that more sinning means the display of more glorious grace,
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.500]   so let's all be about more sinning,
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.820]   we are dead wrong.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.820]   And the first reason he gives why we're dead wrong
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.620]   is that dead people don't do that.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.480]   Dead people don't think that way.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.460]   Dead people don't act that way.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.460]   He says, how can we who died to sin still live in sin?
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.860]   Dead people don't sin like that,
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.860]   and we have died with Christ.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.320]   So double warning.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.540]   Let's heed Paul's warnings
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.180]   as we try to answer the question,
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.460]   does Romans 8:28 mean
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.460]   that even our sins work for our good?
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.220]   Now, the next thing to notice, I think,
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.900]   is the precise wording of Romans 8:28.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.100]   Let's make sure we get it.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.100]   We know that for those who love God,
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.300]   all things work together for good.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.300]   For those who are called according to his purpose.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.000]   So it is a crucial question to ask,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.940]   well, what's the effect of sinning
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.940]   in the heart of those who love God,
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.960]   in the heart of those who are called by God?
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.960]   And surely part of the answer is brokenhearted repentance
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.900]   and self-humbling and a resolve to hate sin more seriously
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.160]   and fight sin more valiantly.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.180]   And those responses are good.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.340]   They're good.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.340]   So yes, sins work for good
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.340]   for those who love God and are called,
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.260]   at least in that sense.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.260]   But this is different from saying
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.260]   that sinning works for our greatest happiness in eternity.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.920]   The promise of working for our good
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.940]   is not the same as the promise
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.780]   of working for our maximal happiness.
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.780]   Now, I know that this introduces a distinction
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.260]   that many people have not perhaps thought about,
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.260]   namely that in heaven, there will be varying rewards,
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.780]   which correspond, I think,
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.900]   to varying capacities for happiness,
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.540]   meaning everyone in heaven will be fully happy.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.480]   That's the meaning of heaven,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.480]   but that some will have capacities of fullness
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.300]   greater than others.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.660]   We talked about this way back in episode 1188.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.980]   If anybody wants to go check,
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.060]   but let me quote Edwards here,
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.080]   just a few sentences to make the point.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.660]   Jonathan Edwards, he says this,
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.260]   "Christ tells us that he who gives a cup of cold water
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.700]   to a disciple in the name of a disciple
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.980]   shall in no wise lose his reward.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.420]   But this could not be true
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.020]   if a person should have no greater reward
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.220]   for doing many good works than if he did but a few.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.700]   It would be no diminishing to the happiness
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.460]   of those who have lower degrees of happiness and glory
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.420]   that there are others in heaven
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.940]   advanced in glory above them.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.620]   For all shall be perfectly happy.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.380]   Every one shall be perfectly satisfied.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.980]   Every vessel that is cast into the ocean of happiness
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.620]   is full, though there are some vessels
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.460]   far larger than others,
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.460]   and there shall be no such thing as envy in heaven,
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.140]   but perfect love shall reign throughout the whole society."
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.320]   That's the end of Edwards' quote.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   So there's a picture of how there can be perfect happiness
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.820]   in everyone in heaven,
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.820]   and yet there can be also degrees of reward
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.980]   greater or lesser capacities for happiness.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.380]   And the point of saying that right here
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.780]   is to open the possibility
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.580]   that when Romans 8:28 says
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.820]   that everything works for our good,
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.820]   it does not guarantee that all of us who love God
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.820]   will have the same capacity for happiness in eternity.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.860]   In other words, good in Romans 8:28
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.860]   does not mean as good or as happy as conceivable,
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:45.300]   since our capacity for happiness may have been greater
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.100]   if we had lived differently.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.820]   But the good of Romans 8:28 does mean
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.280]   enjoying God as fully as your capacity allows.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.040]   So when Paul says, for example, in 1 Corinthians 3:15,
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.360]   if anyone's work is burned up at the final judgment,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.200]   he will suffer loss,
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.300]   though he himself will be saved,
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.200]   but only as through fire.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   When he says that, the implication is that sinful behavior
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.520]   may diminish our capacity for some eternal happiness.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.520]   Now, why do I say may diminish
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.520]   our capacity for eternal happiness?
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.520]   I say may because it is possible
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   that after some season of sinning,
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.520]   say teaching false doctrine,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.520]   we might recognize in this life our failure
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.520]   and repent and be broken and be humbled
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.520]   and turn and be all the more fruitful
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   because of having failed and gotten so much clarity
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.520]   about our mistake that the rest of our lives
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   is more fruitful.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.520]   In other words, it is an oversimplification to say
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.520]   every failure to do the very good deed
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   that would have been rewarded with future joy
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.520]   necessarily means that our future capacity for future joy
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.520]   is diminished by that failure.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:33.520]   That does not follow because God may take that very failure,
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   that sin, which forfeited the eternal reward
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   of the good deed that it failed to do
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:47.520]   and cause the very sin to break us and humble us
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.520]   and turn us into a path of even greater devotion
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.520]   and obedience and fruitfulness and eternal joy.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:02.520]   So I'm not saying every sin has this remarkable effect.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.520]   I'm not. I don't think that's true.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.520]   That would be an overstatement.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.520]   Some sins of God's people simply work
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.520]   for our good and God's glory
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.520]   because they bring about forgiveness and justification
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.520]   and thankfulness.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   So I conclude every sin in those who truly love God
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.520]   works for God's glory, which is our joy.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   And in his amazing grace, God makes some sins
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.520]   gloriously devastating to our ego
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:51.520]   and thus exceptionally fruitful for our eternal joy.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   Thank you, Pastor John, for thinking this one through.

[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.520]   this obviously includes suffering, as we mentioned at the outset.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   So what is God's good design in our pain?
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.520]   That's the topic up next time on Wednesday when we return.
