[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   A podcast listener named Elisa with a historical connection to you, Pastor John,
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.160]   writes in to ask this, "Hello Pastor John, thanks for your ministry over all these
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.920]   years. Incidentally, we," that's her and her husband, "we met you when we were post
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.040]   Stanford students attending InterVarsity's Western Leadership Conference
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.000]   sometime around 1985. I was one of the worship leaders at the conference and
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.440]   vividly remember you speaking on Christian hedonism, a life-changing
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.620]   paradigm for us. Now that we're empty nesters, my husband and I are asking the
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.160]   question, 'How do we spend the next portion of our lives?' However, for better or worse,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.880]   my dear husband is something of a perfectionist and doesn't want to make a
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.840]   mistake in answering this important question." So the question becomes this,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.160]   "When the stakes are so high, how do you not become paralyzed with the fear of
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.040]   making a mistake in this huge decision?"
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:03.440]   I have to ask, "How can you be a perfectionist as an empty nester? How can you live that long and still be a perfectionist?"
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.760]   Well, anyway, he is, so we're gonna deal with this. So Elisa, this is wonderful to be
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.520]   reminded of those days at Stanford. I remember them, and I remember them pretty
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.240]   clearly for reasons that are not altogether positive, because I remember
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.920]   that the leader of the inner varsity group and I were moving in different
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.600]   directions, it seemed. I'm gonna close with that in just a few
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.480]   minutes and apply that to your situation. So here are the things that come to my
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.120]   mind, and I'm exactly in your situation. You're younger than I am, but I'm
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.360]   thinking about that kind of question. So here are my thoughts. Number one, one of the
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.640]   best ways to overcome the fear, perfectionistic fear, of making a mistake
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.760]   in what you decide to do is to realize that deciding nothing is the biggest
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.080]   mistake. There's your deal breaker. That'll get you going. In other
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:09.800]   words, you're not in a neutral zone. There are no neutral zones. Not to move toward
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.760]   a God-sized goal in this next season of your life is to disobey. So standing
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.000]   still is not an option, because it means you're drifting. You're never standing
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.040]   still. You're drifting, and you're coasting with the culture and the way of
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.840]   the world. That's the first thing. Second thing, God loves to steer a moving ship.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.640]   If you're tied up in the harbor of comfort and leisure, God ordinarily will
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.120]   not give you clear direction. He gives direction to captains who point their
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.160]   ship out of the harbor, into the storm. Think about Jonah. Kind of a
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.840]   counterintuitive illustration. Even Jonah was moving in exactly the wrong
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.160]   direction, and God stopped him. He didn't send him home, say start over. He didn't
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.620]   send him home. He made that journey part of the journey, and he sent exactly where
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.560]   he wanted to be. Not exactly in the way he wanted, but he got him where he wanted
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.800]   to go because he was moving. Number three, one of the ways to be moving without
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.720]   knowing exactly where you're going is what I might call investigative moving.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.880]   You're moving when you are pursuing possibilities with serious
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.520]   investigation. That too is moving. Number four, take heart from the many
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.800]   promises of God that in his great mercy he will give you the guidance you need
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:53.560]   when you trust him. For example, Psalm 25 8, "Good and upright is the Lord, therefore
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.960]   he instructs sinners in the way." So we qualify, right? He instructs sinners in
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.000]   the way. He leads the humble—people who know they're sinners and admit it and
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.960]   cry out—he leads the humble in what is right. He teaches the humble his way. That
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.560]   is a precious promise of guidance. Number five, pursue with all your might what is
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   crystal clear as God's will in Scripture. For example, 1 Thessalonians 4 3, "This is
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.280]   the will of God for Elisa and her husband, your sanctification, your
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.720]   holiness." If you have a full, deep, wide, rich understanding of holiness, it's not
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.840]   bad advice to say, "Pursue holiness with all your might and do as you please." God,
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.440]   just do! Just do! Because if you are passionate about being holy and
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.920]   maximizing your love of God, then it'll happen. God loves to give direction,
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.440]   fruitful direction, to lovers of holiness who pursue it with all their hearts.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:12.920]   Number six, in this process of prayer and investigation, dream bigger than aging
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:20.360]   fatalism would allow you. I find in my own heart at age 70 the temptation to
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:30.720]   think, "I don't have long to live, so I should be probably restricted in my
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.360]   dreams of what I can accomplish." Now, I think that's a mistake. I think it's a
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:45.360]   serious mistake, and I'm trying to strive against that thought. I have no idea how
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.600]   long I have left. You don't either. I never have had any idea how long I have
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.080]   left, but when I was younger, I assumed that I could accomplish more simply
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.000]   because of the amount of time that was in front of me, probably. But in fact, the
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.560]   accomplishments came because of God's blessing on a particular season. It
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.960]   wasn't the length of life. It was the power of seasons, and who knows, who knows
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.520]   what you might accomplish in the next season. So don't let the fatalism of
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:31.920]   aging limit your dreams of fruitfulness. And the last thing relates to Stanford
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.960]   1985. One of the reasons I look back with some sadness on those Christian
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:46.240]   hedonism talks is because little by little as the series of messages
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.840]   went on, I saw myself through interacting with students and the leader, I saw
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.680]   myself going in a different direction than the inner varsity leader at the
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.880]   time. His stress was on the wonder and the glory of the fact that God works for
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.760]   us. We are not God's employees trying to earn wages. We are the patients of the
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.120]   great physician who is using all his wisdom and his skill to serve us and our
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:23.040]   eternal health, and that's true, and I love it, love it. But the note I was
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:32.040]   striking then and have been ever since was when God works for us, the goal of
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:39.480]   his work is to fit us for enjoying God himself. That's what the physician does,
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.440]   not like any earthly physician. This heavenly physician is trying to get
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.080]   our disease healed that makes us find substitutes for God so that in our
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.680]   wellness we will see him, know him, love him, be satisfied in him. God himself is
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.600]   the all-satisfying treasure, and as I recall, the students back then began to
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:08.000]   discern a different trajectory between me and the leader. So here's the way it
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.400]   relates to you. In your case now, the question perhaps finally is this, what
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:23.680]   new vision for our next chapter of life would cause us to taste most fully the
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.840]   power of God, the wisdom of God, the grace of God in our lives? How can we get more
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:36.280]   of God? And I think if that's the passion, God will show you the answer. That's a
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.920]   very helpful word, Pastor John, for all of us who are faced with a season of
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.020]   decision and stuck in indecision. We need to act, thank you. And moving the
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.400]   conversation from the paralysis of indecision into the realm of boundless
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.200]   decision-making, the next question is, in the age to come when there will be no
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.600]   sorrow for sin and there will be no sin at all, when we will experience perfect
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.640]   freedom for the first time, so will heaven be a place that we can do
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.800]   whatever we want all the time? That's the question next time. It's a good one.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.120]   Pastor John and I will return on Friday and he will explain the four stages of what it
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.440]   means to be really free. We'll see you then.
