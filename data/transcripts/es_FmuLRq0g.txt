[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   when people think about their withdrawal rate, their early retirement,
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.320]   how does inflation play a role in all of this?
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.280]   Obviously, what you want to do is you want to adjust everything by inflation,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.400]   right, because nothing makes sense if you look at just nominal numbers.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.240]   The gold standard that you want to follow in every single safe
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.520]   withdrawal analysis is that, first of all, the withdrawals should be adjusted
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.520]   for inflation. And then also when you look at, well, what is my final value
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.000]   at time X, that should also be adjusted for inflation.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.600]   It doesn't make a huge difference if your goal is to deplete your capital.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.000]   Zero dollars 30 years from now.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.680]   It doesn't matter if it's a nominal or real dollars.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.400]   But if you have a goal of giving a bequest of a million dollars in 30 years,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.880]   it makes a huge difference whether that is after inflation or before inflation.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.200]   Everything I do is always inflation adjusted.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.040]   Inflation adjustments have to be always in there, otherwise you're comparing apples and oranges.
