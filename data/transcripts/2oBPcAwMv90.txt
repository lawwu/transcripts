[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.820]   In the last podcast, in episode 94, we talked about whether online teachers
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.160]   threaten the authority of leaders in a local church. Pastor John, in this episode,
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.360]   speak to average pastors, those who are fully aware that they cannot compete
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.800]   with you or Tim Keller or Matt Chandler or any number of online preachers when
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.640]   it comes to preaching gift. What would you say to an ordinary preacher in a
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:34.440]   local church? I'd like to devote the rest of my life to encouraging him. I taught a
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.200]   preaching class yesterday. I've been teaching preaching for years, and most of
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.280]   these guys are average preachers, I would say. There are a few remarkable ones
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.600]   among them, and I give myself to trying to encourage them. And here's what I say.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.840]   When they're done preaching, I think one of the most important things I can say to
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.000]   them is, "You know, if you will do what you did there and just get better and
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.960]   better at that, namely, opening to me a paragraph from the Bible that explains
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.920]   to me what these phrases mean, applies them simply and earnestly and passionately
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.280]   with a heartfelt and prayerful attitude towards my life, I will grow under your
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.640]   ministry." I remember one time years ago, I was called upon to give a teacher
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.200]   recommendation when I was teaching at Bethel to a young seminary student who
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.760]   came to Olivet Baptist Church to preach, and he gave me a form. He said, "Would you
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.560]   fill this out when I'm done preaching? Because I have to do this for my
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.320]   preaching class." And he preached on Colossians 1. Can you believe that? This
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.880]   is 35 years ago plus, and I remember the text he preached on,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.400]   Colossians 1, and the prayer of Paul. And he simply, in a fairly pedestrian way,
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.600]   worked his way through every phrase of that prayer, commented on what it meant,
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.560]   applied it to my life, some illustrations of how he prayed it and how I might pray
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.960]   it. And the next morning, I'm jogging, and that whole sermon was present to my mind.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.400]   And it wasn't present to my mind because he was a flashy communicator. It was
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.960]   present to my mind because he was a faithful expositor. He had showed me what
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.400]   the Bible meant. I think people are hungry. "Show me what these words mean.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.760]   Explain these sentences to me. How are they explosively wonderful, and how do
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.800]   they relate to my life? How do they change things?" So I think that the best
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.600]   encouragement that I can make is this. Being a flashy communicator, being a
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.400]   great orator doesn't necessarily lead to edification, and it doesn't necessarily
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.440]   lead to the conversion of sinners. It doesn't necessarily lead to the glory of
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.680]   Christ. In fact, it can get in the way of glorifying Christ. What builds up
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:57.880]   the church is a clear, heartfelt, faithful explanation of what the word means
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.640]   sentence by sentence, and an exaltation over that word so that you reveal how
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.040]   precious and valuable it is to you. And I think a man who's anointed with the
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.840]   Holy Spirit and has a love for the Word of God and a measure of gifted
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.360]   explanation—that is, a gift of teaching—as pedestrian as he may feel his
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.960]   communication style is, or even his personality, he can take a people deep
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.120]   into the Word of God, and that's what the church desperately needs. And frankly,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.640]   Tony, I think what's going to happen is this. The Internet is going
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.640]   to become like the telephone and television, and it won't have the
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.240]   pizazz it once had, and people will begin to settle into real life again, and they
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.760]   will desperately need friends, they will need people in their lives with flesh
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.000]   and bones, and they'll need pastors who show up at the hospital, who show up at
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.800]   the graveside, and all the flesh is just going to be less fleshy someday, I think.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.520]   There will never be a replacement for those person-to-person relationships.
