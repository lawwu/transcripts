[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460]   A podcast listener named Sarah who lives in Chicago writes in to ask this, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.480]   how should Christians respond to the sin of unbelievers?
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.400]   I have longtime friends who are not Christians who partake in drunkenness and homosexuality among other sins
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.840]   and I'm wondering how to respond to their behavior with love and with grace.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.400]   In conversation, should I be unresponsive to their willful sin in the hopes of remaining friends with them and their eventual salvation?
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.160]   Or should I call out their sin and explain to them why they are in need of a Savior with the risk of alienating them
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160]   and losing our friendship?"
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.760]   We know that Jesus was called a
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.440]   friend of tax collectors and
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.440]   sinners, Matthew 11 19.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.120]   And we know that he was invited
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.200]   into the homes of sinners, both the non-religious kind like tax collectors and sinners,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.840]   he calls them people like prostitutes, and
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:06.840]   the religious kind like Pharisees. What we don't know is how often Jesus was invited back.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.040]   And
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:17.840]   the reason that seems like a real question to me as I read the Gospels is that he explained his presence with sinners
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.960]   differently than you might expect.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.440]   He didn't explain himself as a simple friend who just enjoys hanging out with sinners,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.080]   like they would make them feel good.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.560]   Friendship with tax collectors and sinners and Pharisees did not mean for Jesus the enjoyment of their fellowship.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.920]   They had very little in common to fellowship around.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.400]   He loved them too much
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   to enjoy what they enjoyed. The way Jesus explained his presence with sinners was this,
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.240]   this is Matthew 9 10, "Those who are well have no need of a physician,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.760]   but those who are sick, go and learn what this means.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.680]   I desire mercy and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.760]   sinners to repentance." And lots of people today I think would say, "Good grief that was offensive.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.320]   I mean, that's an offensive way to talk.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.360]   I'm hanging out with you because you're sick and you need a physician.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.720]   You're a sinner and not righteous and you need a Savior. That's the meaning of my
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.400]   presence as Savior and doctor." There are a lot of people today I think who would say, "That's just inauthentic."
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.120]   You need to first
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120]   really enjoy the camaraderie
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.080]   that you have with
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.360]   believers and then when they feel that you you're really one of them and enjoy being with them,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.160]   then they might be willing to hear that they are sick and need a physician and sinners and need a Savior.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.760]   Well, that's not the way Jesus was thinking.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.600]   I can imagine that in most of these dinner parties, Jesus said things that were so blunt and
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.720]   so straightforward and to some so offensive that he never got invited back.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.760]   For example, when he was invited to Simon's house,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.240]   he was criticized by his host for allowing a woman to anoint his feet and wipe them with her hair.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.480]   And his response was a full-blown
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.360]   indictment of his host.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.040]   Turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, "You see this woman. I entered your house.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.000]   You gave me no water from my feet. She has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.480]   You gave me no kiss.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.280]   From the time I came in, she's not ceased to kiss my feet. You didn't anoint my head with oil and she has anointed my
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.560]   feet with ointment. Therefore I tell you,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.720]   her sins which are many are forgiven, for she loved much, but he who is forgiven little loves little."
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.080]   It is easy to imagine that at many of the dinner parties,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.080]   Jesus went to issues arose in the conversation that exposed the
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.720]   selfishness and pride and greed and sensuality of
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.640]   sinful friends that he loved.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.000]   And from the little we can see, it is highly unlikely that Jesus would have simply
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.040]   listened and said nothing about the ways of the kingdom.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.680]   He would have acted like a physician.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.640]   "I see some disease here and I know a remedy."
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.280]   And he points them to the ways of the kingdom.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.520]   Later in the first century,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.440]   we do get a glimpse in 1st Peter of the very tension that Sarah is asking about.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.720]   On the one hand, Peter calls Christians to be overflowing with good deeds towards unbelievers in the hope that their criticisms will be
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.080]   silenced.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.080]   Criticism of Christians will be silenced.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.000]   That their hostile attitudes would be shamed,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:11.920]   silenced, 2.15, chapter 2, verse 15. Shame, chapter 3, verse 16. And that they would be brought to glorify God, chapter 2, verse 12.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.360]   So it's clear that the believers didn't want to unnecessarily alienate the unbelievers,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.760]   but rather to win them and
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.120]   declare the excellencies of him who called them out of darkness into light, chapter 2, verse 9.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.040]   But Peter was also aware that Christians were called to live
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.000]   lives of such purity and holiness
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.160]   that
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.280]   unbelievers would inevitably be offended and critical as the Christians pulled away from
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.720]   fellowship in those sins.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.560]   This is an amazing two verses in chapter 4, verse 3 and 4.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.400]   "For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.800]   passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.400]   lawless idolatry, with respect to these they are surprised
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.840]   when you do not now join them in the same flood of
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.320]   debauchery and they
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.040]   malign you."
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.040]   So the point here is simply that
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:24.080]   we live with the tensions of what love really requires of us.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.240]   What does a true friend really do?
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:36.960]   A true friend is full of good deeds and returns good for evil and a true friend
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:44.640]   abstains from sinful behavior and declares the excellencies of Christ. And both of these strategies are
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.000]   necessary.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.040]   Neither is guaranteed to win over the unbeliever.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.360]   That's what we long for. That's what we pray for.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.880]   But we don't shrink back from our good deeds and we don't shrink back from lives of purity and holiness and
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.400]   verbal declarations of the excellencies of Christ. We leave
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.100]   the outcome and the fruit to God in Christ by the Spirit.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.640]   So I would say to Sarah, the longer you wait to explain
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.080]   Christ and his
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:24.600]   excellencies and the ways of Christ and the reasons for your hope in Christ, the more awkward
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.080]   it will seem to you when it comes and the more perplexed
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.420]   your friends are going to be that it took you so long.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:39.920]   So ask your small group at church or your friends or whoever believers you have in your life, ask them to
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.360]   pray for you earnestly and then go ahead and put into words
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.680]   your love for your unbelieving friends.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.120]   Yeah, that's a pointed approach. We need to think through and apply with wisdom.
