[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.240]   This episode was jointly hosted by the Starting Out and the Pre- and Early Retirement Life
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.760]   States Chapters and recorded October 25th, 2023.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.880]   The topic was Estate Planning Basics, Taking Care of Your Parents.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.880]   Open Q&A.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.560]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.600]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.520]   investment advice.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.640]   I'll mention Mike Piper's book.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.280]   So a lot of folks may know of Mike Piper.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.760]   He's very active with the Bogleheads and he's extremely involved with the Boglehead Center,
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.840]   I'm sorry, John Bogle Center for Financial Literacy, excuse me, even the treasurer for
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.920]   that organization.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.920]   So he's got a book on Amazon and the Kindle copy is $4.99, last I checked, and it's called
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.880]   After the Death of Your Spouse, and I'm just going to put it on my screen briefly so that
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.120]   folks have something quasi-tangible to act on.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.500]   And although the title is After the Death of Your Spouse, I found the first half almost
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.720]   like a checklist in preparing.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.760]   So one would benefit from reading this well before what the title implies.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.880]   So with that, and folks who don't know Mike Piper, he's a CPA and he's very active again
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.040]   on the forums, very accessible, he's humble, he's approachable, he's a phenomenal person.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.080]   So I'm very comfortable recommending this book.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.200]   And more specifically, I'll just cover the table of contents.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:53.440]   The book's divided in this way of immediate steps and very practical, almost checklist-oriented
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.160]   what folks would be encountering, but you can read it and in advance know what to plan
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.160]   for.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:10.440]   So it covers the roles of the executor and by empowering yourself, and it's very conversationally
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.520]   written, void of jargon, very user-friendly.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.920]   So I wholeheartedly recommend at least the first half for the planning stage.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.280]   And why I distinguish the second half towards the bottom of this table of contents, you
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.740]   see part two, intermediate next steps.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.200]   This large, and now I'm forwarding to the next part of the table of contents, a lot
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.600]   of this addresses the technical financial aspects of accounts and beneficiaries for
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.160]   IRAs and inherited IRAs, and even deferring an inheritance, which didn't occur to me,
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.280]   and he goes over why one might do that, tax reasons and otherwise.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.540]   Something else that I thought was really valuable in the first half of the book was notifying
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.640]   credit bureaus, so the credit reporting agencies like TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax, after
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.880]   the death of your spouse, because there's identity theft.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.280]   So that hadn't occurred to me.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.920]   I think a lot of people are versed in subsections of this topic, but there's just a gold mine,
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.440]   a treasure trove of practical insights here.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.480]   So again, I'll scroll back to the cover.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.080]   That's the title, "After the Death of Your Spouse" by Mike Piper.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.320]   You can find it on Kindle for $4.99 as of today.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.240]   With that, I will stop sharing my screen.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.640]   Pause, share.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.080]   Pause that.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.940]   Okay.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.120]   With that, I'll jump into how we'll structure the rest of today's meeting.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.000]   So thanks to everyone for joining.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.900]   We've divided the topical content into these five categories, which I'll read.
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.800]   The first, taking care of an aging parent.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.720]   Second, elder care planning, including power of attorney.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.640]   The third, health directives and proxies, as well as living wills.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.700]   The fourth, guardianships, including custody and handling incapacitation.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.220]   And the fifth of five is end of life situations, including prepaid funerals.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.360]   So with those topics, we'll open it up to the group to share, as Mary mentioned, personal
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.040]   experiences, focused questions.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.080]   We will aggregate those questions, compile them, consolidate them, present them to Summerfield
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.200]   so that when we reschedule, he can address them in a very focused manner.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.480]   So I'll pause for a second.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.600]   Miriam or team, did I miss anything in terms of how we'll structure what folks can expect
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.560]   in terms of ground rules for the meeting?
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.920]   May I ask, Michelle, did your hand up for a reason?
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.880]   And also there's background noise, so if you're not intending to speak, can you mute, please?
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.800]   Okay, thank you.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   Okay.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.460]   So Alan, Lady Geek, Miriam, did I miss anything in terms of how we intend to structure this
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.240]   since there's a bit of ad hoc going on?
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   No.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   Okay.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.840]   So why don't we open it up to the group, taking care of an elder parent.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.840]   This is an opportunity ideally to share factual, informed insights, guidance, experience, things
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.080]   that you found helpful, specific questions you have.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:47.600]   What we'd like to avoid is too highly opinionated where it could be wrong or where it's not
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.840]   factual and it could lead to mis- or disinformation.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.480]   So nothing wrong with sharing what you found helpful.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.240]   It's obviously subjective, but we want to avoid putting out wrong information.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.440]   So with that, let's open up taking care of an aging parent.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:15.120]   Feel free to raise your hand, put questions in the chat.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:24.780]   Does anyone have a specific question about taking care of an aging parent or those who
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.800]   have?
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.920]   So Stu has his or her hand raised.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.640]   Stu, feel free.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:43.880]   My mom lives in Florida and we are not in Florida and it seems like she's having issues
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.320]   getting to doctor's appointments.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:54.080]   So she's late 80s and she's been asking her neighbors, but I can tell the neighbors are
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.480]   getting tired of taking mom to her appointments.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.080]   How far are the doctors and how many?
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.640]   Maybe like 15 to 30 minutes away.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.160]   And how often does she need to go?
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:16.080]   Well, I'd say maybe once a month and a half, every month and a half.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   Okay.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.080]   Miriam has her hand up.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.720]   One thing, check her insurance policy.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:30.840]   Her health insurance policy to see if there is the health insurance company can pay for
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.000]   a medical van to take her.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.900]   She's eligible for that.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.960]   And also our relatives used, well, first of all, there are also private medical vans that
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.280]   she could sign up with.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:51.120]   And sometimes the local counties have medical vans that are available.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.040]   And we would have to apply with the county to, especially in Florida, to apply with the
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.480]   county, with the agencies that supply the medical vans.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:09.600]   But I remember using one for a relative and they actually, the relative was in a wheelchair.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.120]   They would put the wheelchair in the van and it would be locked inside the van.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.040]   So it didn't move.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:22.520]   And it was, I could go with our relative in the van also to the doctor's appointment.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.360]   And the reason I could not take the person is that, first of all, if the person fell
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.300]   out of the wheelchair, I could not pick them up.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:38.080]   And then also it was just so difficult maneuvering the wheelchair and getting the person from
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.960]   the wheelchair into my car.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:48.280]   So the medical van was the solution rather than a neighbor who, it comes to a point where
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.440]   the neighbor is not going to be so willing probably.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.840]   She's got a Blue Cross-Fed program, basic.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:09.200]   I don't think she would want to spend a dollar on any transportation.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.420]   She'd rather miss her appointment.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.840]   - What's her mobility like?
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.560]   - She's fine, but late 80s, she's not the best driver anymore.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:26.520]   - I was gonna say, I've had to arrange transportation in Florida for my parents on occasion, and
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.800]   when they couldn't get, they're in assisted living and they generally can get rides from
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.000]   the assisted living to their appointments.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:44.720]   But when I've had to arrange a ride, there are some taxi services that cater to the senior
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   population.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.960]   You might have to search them out, but it may not be available where you want to live,
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   but it might be something to look at.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.280]   It might be a cheaper option than maybe the full medical transport, which can get kind
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.280]   of expensive.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:08.960]   - Is she in a suburban or urban, or how dense is her environment?
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:15.440]   - Between Fort Myers and Naples, it's called Estero.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.560]   Well, it's a suburban.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.480]   - Okay, and so some of these options like medical van or specialized taxi services,
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.680]   you mentioned her perhaps reluctance to spend.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.480]   Are you or others covering her costs?
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.680]   If that were covered, would she be more agreeable to using these services?
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.280]   I don't want to volunteer you, it's perhaps a hypothetical.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.600]   - I think if we were to spend the money, she would ask how much it costs and then she would
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.620]   get mad at us for spending the money.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.040]   What if you told her it was a fraction of what it really costs?
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   - She might find out.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:06.880]   That's what I was thinking, maybe like, "Hey, we got a big discount on Uber.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.340]   We got a 75% coupon and we got a bunch of rides for you, mom."
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.000]   - So Uber has worked for her?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   What has been working for you?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   She hasn't done that yet.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   She's afraid to do that, but I'm thinking.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.600]   - Are you going to tell her you're submitting it to insurance for a reimbursement?
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.080]   - Gorey, in the chat, one of the Vogelheads said, Sarah said, "Sometimes organizations
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:39.760]   for specific diseases, for example, the American Cancer Society may have a ride program through
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.760]   volunteers."
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.760]   - Excellent.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.040]   So, Stu, thanks for the question.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.920]   You definitely want to poll the audience for other topics or questions, but absent that,
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.000]   we can continue on this if it's helpful.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.920]   I'm not monitoring the chat, so if others have things from the chat that should be shared
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.680]   verbally, Miriam or others, please do.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:12.000]   Stu, was there anything more to your question that you want to share, either what has worked
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.040]   well for you, what may help others, what you learned later that benefited you that could
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.900]   help others early on?
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:30.040]   - Well, no, but right now, it's just been the neighbors, you know, and I'll be talking
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.560]   about this to my brothers because we need to have...
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.160]   We can't have her neighbors, like, relying on them.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.160]   - Okay.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.160]   Understood.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.160]   Let's see.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.160]   Alan has a question.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:49.280]   - As I just want to point, I put a link in the chat of a helpful book resource to how
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.480]   to initiate the financial conversation with parents when you're addressing potential future
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.300]   needs or current.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:01.760]   Sometimes they're unwilling and uncomfortable having a conversation with a child about their
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.040]   future needs, and there's a wonderful book.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.540]   I've heard this author a number of times on some podcasts, Cameron Huddleston, basically
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.600]   about how to approach the conversation.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.040]   She wrote about her own experience with her mother.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.080]   The book is titled "Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk," how to have essential conversations
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:27.000]   with your parents about their finances, which also includes elder care planning and such.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.680]   Just wanted to point that out as a good resource.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.680]   - Great.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.680]   Thanks, Alan.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:38.760]   As far as getting assistance for driving an elderly parent, certainly if they have any
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:44.440]   religious affiliations, congregations that may be able to offer such services, and just
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:51.840]   Googling for the local county that she resides in, as well as the city, for assistance.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.800]   I know my mother, who also lives in Florida and Clearwater, we've kind of dealt with this
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.400]   a little bit.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:04.520]   We've actually found a private driver rather than using Uber, but I found out there is
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.240]   actually a volunteer organization that does provide services for nominal amounts, like
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:17.400]   $10 round trip within a certain radius of mileage.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.920]   Those services might be available.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:25.960]   - I found the private driver not to be that expensive, relatively speaking, myself.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.120]   - Yeah, it depends, yeah.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.360]   - Okay, very helpful.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.840]   So a parallel question in the absence of other questions, why don't we quickly pull.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.800]   If you have a question, please raise your hand or just chime in.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.160]   This is super informal, feel free.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.800]   You won't be interrupting, but in the absence of questions, I'm wondering, folks on this
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:15:03.840]   call seem cognitively aware, engaged, conversant, and we might have our own plans to age in
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.080]   place or stay in our homes as long as we're physically able, et cetera, but at some point,
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.620]   we lose objectivity and we're not able to make the same decisions that we thought we
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.880]   committed to earlier.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:25.760]   So how have folks navigated this kind of less obvious transition of someone in their 50s
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.960]   or 60s saying, "Yes, when it's my time to move to assisted living, I'll voluntarily
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.280]   do that," but when they're 70 and all the things that they, in their younger rational
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:46.320]   days, they would have said they'd volunteer for, they no longer have that lens.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.880]   Making my questions clear, when we lose the objectivity to voluntarily lose the home or
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:16:00.520]   seek assistance, leave the home, I mean, or accept assistance, I don't know, there must
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.160]   be people who've experienced this and how do we guard against that for ourselves?
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:18.320]   So are you saying that a family member would force the parents into an assisted situation?
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.880]   Is that kind of what you're-
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.960]   Oh no, not at all.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.320]   So it's entirely hypothetical, but definitely I don't mean to imply anyone being forced
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.320]   or anything.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:33.640]   So let's say in my current rational state, or I think I'm rational, I'll say when I need
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:39.960]   assistance, when I'm no longer independent, when my quality of life has deteriorated significantly,
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.400]   I'll be open to moving to a facility.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.360]   That's what I say in my current state, when I have the cognitive ability to say that,
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:53.280]   and I mean it genuinely with the best of intentions, but fast forward a few decades, I'm no longer
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.920]   able to take care of myself, but I no longer have the objectivity to say, "I agreed to
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.460]   leave my home and accept assistance at this point."
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:11.320]   So my future self is holding on to distorted self-impressions of, "I'm still independent.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.720]   I can exist in my home.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.560]   I don't need assistance."
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.840]   Even though I previously said, "When the time comes, I will welcome those things."
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   But it's-
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:29.200]   I think what tends to happen is, I know in my family situation, there was a medical event
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:40.800]   that triggered, that re-triggered the discussion that my parents should move, and they finally
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800]   did agree.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:47.360]   They made good plans, but I think they were trying to hold on to their lifestyle at home
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:55.520]   as long as they could, but they went beyond when they probably should have gone, but the
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:05.520]   medical events that they were in, I think it takes maybe family members staying engaged,
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:14.880]   evaluating cognitive, physical conditions, and assess what the options are for family
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.880]   members.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.880]   Okay.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   That helps.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.880]   A medical event sounds clear.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.560]   So I see Miriam has her hand up, and then Ellen.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   Yes.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.680]   I think this happens all the time, Gorrie.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.720]   On the Vogelheads Forum, it seems that at every point in time, we have a thread that
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:35.200]   involves, "My elderly relative refuses to leave the home.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   My elderly aunt lives on a farm in the middle of Minnesota, 30 miles from the nearest medical
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.080]   center, and she refuses to leave."
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:52.320]   We have relatives who will- they are intent on aging in place in the home, even though
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:58.720]   right now they are basically homebound and bedridden.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:04.680]   So it comes to a point, I think, where this is where guardianships come in, I suspect.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.920]   And then also, what do you do?
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.760]   You just pick them up or get the sheriff out there and put them into a facility?
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:18.000]   This is a very, very difficult decision because, as you say, they're not necessarily thinking
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:28.320]   clearly due to age, or they just don't want to get old, they just don't want to move,
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.560]   they don't want to be in a facility.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.360]   It's very, very difficult.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.680]   There's different components of this, too.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:43.160]   I know with my own dad, he loved to drive, but during one of my visits, I knew he shouldn't
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:50.920]   have been driving, and I had to engage his primary care doctor to- she was going to report
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.120]   him to the state of Florida to have his license revoked.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.840]   But before she did that, she asked if he would visit with her to discuss this, and during
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.040]   that visit, he agreed to give up his license.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:15.680]   But that was a component of just keeping him safe and keeping other people safe as well.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.000]   So I see Allen has his hand up.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:27.280]   I'll just ask in the interim, have folks seen something work in this situation?
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.840]   Are people, like in Miriam's example of bedridden, homebound, want to age in place, are they
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:41.600]   more receptive to conversations with their peers, their close friends, maybe family members
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:47.320]   who aren't the younger generation who are, you know, encouraging the different facility?
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.600]   But if they're someone from their own age group who went through something similar,
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:21:00.400]   have folks experienced that a bedridden, homebound, age in place, reluctant person is more receptive,
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.920]   more permeable, depending on the source of information?
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:11.120]   Okay, maybe we can revisit that.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.120]   There's almost no choice.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:18.920]   I mean, it gets to the point where for the elderly relative that I am thinking of in
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.640]   our family, where they will simply have no choice.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.560]   Right now, they do not have their medicines on auto refill.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.200]   They're not taking their medicines.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.520]   They have a commode next to their bed.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.600]   They cannot empty the commode.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.720]   You know, every time we go over, it is a new thing.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.200]   One more thing.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.920]   It's embarrassing to say that this is a relative in the family.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.440]   But this is what they want to do.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.280]   They want to age in place.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.920]   They are serious, they are intent on it.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.800]   A guardianship, I understand.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.800]   We've never done it.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:02.360]   Nobody, I know in our family, we have a large family, nobody has ever had to have a guardianship.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.120]   Because eventually it just became so obvious, the family went and said, we have a great
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.520]   place for you.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.640]   We have a wonderful place for you.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.920]   And you need to go there because you're going to lose the home.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.360]   Or because for some reason, we just simply have to do it.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.040]   Now is the time.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.840]   And eventually move them.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.800]   Find a place that you think that they would feel comfortable with.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.200]   Find a place financially that is doable.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.560]   It's very, very difficult.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:36.080]   I don't know how else to explain it, but it would depend on each individual person.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.760]   Some people qualify for Medicaid.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.200]   Others do not.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.800]   Some have financial resources.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.960]   Others do not.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.760]   It's a very big area.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760]   Mm-hmm.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:53.960]   So maybe it takes exposure long before the situation, touring facilities saying, would
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.520]   you ever consider moving here if the situation came to it?
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.520]   I'll say no.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.440]   That's a nice thing to do, but they're going to say no.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.560]   Well, this relative has said no.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:10.680]   But I'm saying in the rational decade or two before the event presents, if when folks have
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:16.960]   objectivity and it's framed hypothetically as if you reached a state where you needed
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:25.600]   a commode next to your bed, where you couldn't physically perform x, y, z, those daily functions,
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.160]   would you consider this place, this?
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.480]   They will say no.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:36.200]   Because first of all, I will never be in a position to need a commode next to my bed.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.480]   And also if I do, I will be able to take care of it.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.620]   Or I will hire a lady to come in and clean.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:49.880]   There will be rational in their mind, rational explanations for why they will never need
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.920]   to move to an assisted living facility.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:58.560]   And by the way, I never use with our relative, this relative, the word nursing home.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.400]   I always call it an assisted living facility.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:09.800]   But that and it helps a little bit, but they will, you know, that there will always be
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.320]   a reason on their mind why they don't need it.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.160]   And also they will think that they will get better.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.200]   Today I can't get out of bed, but tomorrow I'll probably be able to.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.800]   If I take my extra Tylenol, I will be able to get out of bed and I'll be able to push
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.920]   the microwave buttons to make my dinner.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.040]   That's how it comes and it doesn't happen.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.040]   Understood.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.040]   It comes down to independence.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:41.660]   I think that's really people try to, I think, I think the intention is good.
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:47.280]   Maybe when you're in your fifties or sixties that when you reach that stage that you would
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.280]   consider it.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.560]   But then when you get there, you've enjoyed the life that you've had and you're just trying
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.640]   to.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.680]   But that's my point.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   Are we those people too?
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:05.720]   Because we're referring to a different group, but maybe we're all vulnerable to that.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   So, okay.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.280]   Why don't we pause that for a second, Alan, you've had your hand up for a while.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.280]   And then Sarah.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.280]   Okay.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:16.080]   Just to address this last question, I think the problem is even when people are on sound
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:22.040]   mind and say that I plan on doing X, Y, and Z when cognitive decline kicks in, they probably
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.880]   will no longer recognize or acknowledge that they stated that before.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.120]   So it's a hurdle that's hard to overcome, but you can, there are other resources and
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.460]   ways to approach this.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:38.000]   For instance, most elderly have a primary care physician nowadays met the Medicare wellness
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.040]   annual wellness exam requires a review of a memory test, cognition questionnaire, and
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   other questions.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:51.960]   If you accompany an elderly parent to the primary care annual exam, they will assess
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:57.760]   and ask for input and the physician may be helpful in determining that it perhaps is
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.680]   time to, as a minimum, get some home healthcare, which could be a transition towards assisted
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.680]   living.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:12.280]   Also, if an elderly parent has either a long-term care policy or indemnity plan that offers
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:18.240]   some home health care, that's another way to transition towards a more complete care
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.240]   down the road.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:25.360]   It's certainly prudent to review if your parents will allow you any of their insurance
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:32.600]   policies, particularly long-term care policies and reading in detail what the services are.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:37.840]   I had to go through this with my mother who's 92 and battling pancreatic cancer.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.120]   She had what we thought was a pretty good long-term care policy that turns out now that
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:47.560]   company out of Pennsylvania is in rehabilitation, long story, I could go on for an hour about
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.560]   that.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:53.600]   It does have homemaker benefit, it does have some home healthcare benefit that we've been
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:59.080]   able to take advantage of, and she wants to continue to remain in her home with assistance
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.080]   as needed.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.600]   We may or may not need to have either inpatient hospice care, potentially, or rather in her
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.600]   house.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.160]   But certainly, looking at those resources from the physician, it's typically going to
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.000]   be a medical event that precipitates this.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.800]   Multiple calls, falls, other injuries, unfortunately, that make it more of an urgent matter.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:28.200]   But if somebody's hospitalized and sent to rehab, that's one way to transition to another
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.160]   facility down the road.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.640]   Social worker from the hospital may be able to assist with placement and assessment, at
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.680]   least to assess what their home situation is, and from their professional perspective,
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.520]   that is needed.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.520]   >> Okay.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.520]   Thank you, Alan.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.640]   Very helpful.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.880]   Sarah, you had your hand up?
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.880]   >> Yes.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:28:00.680]   Following up on what Alan said, a medical event can be an opportunity.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:07.640]   Your loved one, even if they're -- so Medicare only -- Medicare, original Medicare only goes
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:14.520]   into a skilled nursing facility at their cost if the -- I think it's 48 hours, 72 hours,
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.160]   something like that.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:23.240]   But even if they don't qualify for that, to discharge somebody from the hospital to an
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.560]   assisted living place, because the doctor said, even if that might not be per se what
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:34.100]   they said, may be a way to get them in the door, and somehow or another, they just never
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.520]   leave that.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:48.060]   There was a story years ago, I think it was on Invisibilia, about how we, as we age, crave
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.920]   the familiar.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:57.160]   And so you're asking somebody who's lived in their home maybe 40 or more years to leave
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:04.320]   the thing that they understand, that they know how to cope with, and when we're looking
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.880]   the most for what is familiar, and that might be something to keep in mind when a relative
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.720]   is pushing back.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:20.580]   You know, one of the reasons to me to moving into a CCRC is that they are a life plan community,
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:24.720]   is that they are the ones that are going to say, you know what, this just ain't working,
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.320]   it's time to move to the next level.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.840]   >> And for folks who don't know, what's a CCRC?
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.080]   >> Pre-McHara Retirement Community, also called a life plan community.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:41.360]   And you know, there's usually a big buy-in, they're also considered a financial risk because
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:49.240]   of that big buy-in, whether or not they will float until you no longer need their services.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:54.240]   There's lots of threads on Bogleheads about CCRCs.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:03.320]   A care manager, if you were able to recruit a care manager, perhaps they would be able
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:11.480]   to be the third party that comes in and says, this doesn't work, I wrote another note here,
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.160]   but I can't read that.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:21.040]   And you know, the other thing that I would be concerned about is whether or not something
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:28.000]   like Adult Protective Services, that's what we call it in my state, could become involved.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.880]   Is there the possibility that this would be considered so negligent that family members
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.120]   would be accused of being negligent?
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:45.200]   And I don't know, and the home care nurses that I knew that called APS back in the day
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:52.920]   when I did a little bit of home care, didn't think that in my state APS was very successful
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.120]   in their deeds.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:00.760]   So, but definitely to, you know, it ain't easy.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.680]   It just is not easy.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.200]   >> Okay.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   Thank you, Sarah.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   Diane?
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:14.920]   >> I came late to this discussion.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.080]   So I'm sorry.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.000]   I'm a boglehead nanny.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:28.640]   I'm just adamant about having the discussion as early as possible, if it's your family
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:35.440]   or if it's someone -- if it's your immediate family or it's someone else, have the discussion.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.280]   Start at age 50.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.760]   Make sure you know.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:45.960]   Someone says, I never, ever want to go into a home.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.720]   Why not?
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.380]   Explore everything that you possibly can.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.640]   Figure out what the alternatives are.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.280]   Do not wait.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.360]   It's -- you write the other thing.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.120]   Write a letter to yourself.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:10.880]   If you think there's a possibility of memory impairment, write a letter to yourself.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.320]   Do not -- and it does not come on suddenly.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:27.640]   There can be suspect -- in terms of the Medicare wellness, it's pretty easy to avoid that.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:36.040]   But if it does not come on suddenly, you know, your loved ones know, write a letter to yourself.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.960]   Be absolutely positive of what you do and don't want.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:47.120]   And if you have a family member that says, I'm going to stay in my home no matter what,
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.360]   then figure out what the scenarios are.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.800]   List them out.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   What if this happens?
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   What if this happens?
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:33:00.840]   If they say no, you have to figure out where your boundaries are and what you can do for
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.840]   them.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   >> Okay.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.840]   Thank you.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.840]   Very helpful.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:10.160]   So I want to also add to the way you said write a letter to yourself, I wonder if people
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.920]   can record videos to themselves.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   And that way, you know, someone said earlier, they will deny having felt that or said that.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:24.000]   But reading something can also be -- I didn't write that, but maybe seeing a video of oneself
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.920]   can be more convincing.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:34.600]   And something also came to mind, a lot of long-term care plans can pay family members
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.800]   to be the caretaker.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.560]   I don't know if folks have familiarity with that.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:48.040]   But where a family member serves the elderly person in their own home so that you don't
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.360]   need to hire necessarily an external home health aide.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:59.400]   So I think that's normal or at least not atypical.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:06.160]   So I want to remind folks of the other topics and in the interest of time, we can -- some
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.280]   of these segue equally into each other.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:15.240]   So the next one on the list is elder care planning, including power of attorney.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:20.000]   So certainly our first portion included a lot of elder care planning.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.200]   But under this umbrella, are there any other additional comments or questions or experiences?
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.900]   >> About the first topic?
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.040]   >> So taking care of an aging parent was the first, then we're moving to the second, elder
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.200]   care planning, including power of attorney.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:45.920]   >> One thing I would add to this topic was it was helpful for me getting my parents to
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:52.240]   consider moving to assisted living several years ago was while my mom was hospitalized,
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:35:01.520]   the case manager mentioned that there were agencies that would help you discern appropriate
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:08.000]   places for placement based on financial resources.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.540]   And that process was so invaluable to getting my parents to open their eyes to what was
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:22.620]   available to them in their community and that they could afford it.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.000]   >> It sounds like a great resource.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.640]   >> Those agencies are free.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.640]   >> Okay.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.800]   I see Miriam has her hand up, but very briefly, Stu, how does one find such an agency?
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.880]   Is it as simple as Googling agencies to help find assisted living?
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.760]   >> Probably.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.000]   >> Okay.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Miriam?
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   >> Yes.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.280]   On powers of attorney, Gary, we did have a question coming in from the RSVP list, and
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:58.680]   it had to do with the difference between financial powers of attorney and health directive powers
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:06.200]   of attorney, whether to have separate documents or one document.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:14.320]   And one of the reasons they asked is that they find that medical places, hospitals and
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:22.560]   nursing homes do not necessarily even ask for the powers of attorney, the power of attorney,
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.920]   but the banks will.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:32.760]   And then also, well, that was that part of the question.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:39.720]   So I know, for example, our power of attorney for my husband's elderly sisters is 27 pages
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:47.080]   long, and that's Times New Roman 12 point or 14 point, the regular document point.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:54.320]   Now, you know, why wasn't -- when I take it with me to their doctors, they don't even
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.320]   want to see it.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.840]   I pull it out, and they think I'm serving them a subpoena or something.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.160]   It's just huge.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.880]   But on the other hand, you need the power of attorney.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:12.720]   You need that for medical decisions, and for -- you need the power of attorney.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.840]   How do people handle the power of attorney, and what has been their experiences in hospitals
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.360]   and nursing homes with the powers of attorney?
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   >> I have experience with it, if you want me to comment.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   >> Pardon me?
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   >> I have experience with it.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.960]   I'm currently using one for my father in Florida.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.080]   I've used it for four years.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:37.200]   He had set up a durable power of attorney with his family lawyer several years ago,
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.480]   and that's good for financial as well as medical.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:46.080]   His medical providers have asked for it for me to talk to them, so it's usually very easily
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.080]   sent over.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.880]   I just -- I've scanned it into a PDF document and emailed it to them when they needed it.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.960]   Occasionally, I'll have to fax one in, but it's not 27 pages.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.640]   I think it might be five or six pages, I think, but it's a standard durable -- it's called
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.480]   a durable power of attorney.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:13.440]   It wouldn't allow me to probably transact, say, real estate transactions, although I
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:20.960]   say that, and I was able to sell my father's house several years ago with it, but I don't
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:28.800]   know if I'd be able to take out loans against the real estate with it, but I haven't attempted
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   to do that either.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   So that's --
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   >> Right.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:38.120]   So I see Diane and then Lady Geek, and just a quick comment.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.000]   The way Miriam mentioned, banks will ask for the power of attorney.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.640]   I think folks in this crowd know banks often have their own specific power of attorney,
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.280]   so you'd want to get a copy of that.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.960]   I was a banker in my career, and we would usually want a power of attorney specific
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.120]   for the transaction if you were borrowing money.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.120]   >> Got it.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.120]   Okay.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.920]   Diane and then Lady Geek, and then Deanna.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.640]   >> It's two totally, totally different things, and what are you trying to accomplish?
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:15.080]   If you're trying to deal with the finances, you need a regular power of attorney, but
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:22.280]   if you're trying to deal with healthcare, you need a durable power of attorney for healthcare,
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.920]   and that needs to be ironclad.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:37.520]   You need to 100% know what your patient wants you to advocate for, and you need to be really,
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:44.720]   really clear, but I'm not sure why there's a confusion between the two separate things,
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:52.400]   because a healthcare provider, in my experience, only wants to know that you have the healthcare
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.560]   power of attorney, and they will recognize that.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.080]   >> Okay.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:03.200]   Miriam, do you want to reiterate if there was confusion?
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.160]   Do you want to clarify that question?
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.760]   When we say healthcare power of attorney, is that different from healthcare proxy?
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.760]   >> Yes.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.760]   >> Okay.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   >> No.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   >> Well, yes, no, no, no, no, it's not different from a healthcare proxy.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.360]   I think it has to do with whether or not you have two separate documents.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.960]   I think that's what the question was, whether there are two separate documents, whether
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:33.920]   you can walk in with a, have your power of attorney, just a health power of attorney,
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   healthcare power of attorney, I guess the healthcare proxy, but for example, our power
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:44.520]   of attorney has healthcare in it as one subsection.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:54.080]   It has real estate, it has financial, it even has virtual currency in it, meaning every
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:41:00.120]   new possible clause that an attorney can put into a power of attorney is there, including
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:10.280]   the latest Florida legislative, legislative law from Florida that if the bank won't accept
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.480]   your power of attorney, then you can sue them.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.320]   Even that is in this power of attorney, it has everything, it has the whole kitchen sink
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:21.040]   in it, and that's what I say, it's 27 pages long, but I think the question had to do with
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:28.280]   having a short power of attorney for healthcare versus putting in all the financial stuff
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:33.840]   in the power of attorney, because the question says that they find that the medical places,
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.960]   hospitals and nursing homes, don't even want to look at it, they just say, do you have
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   it?
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.960]   And then they accept it.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:47.720]   My experience at Durable has worked for the medical community, when they've asked for
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:55.000]   it, I've sent it in, and it was like magic, they started talking to me, so it's good.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Okay.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Diane, your hand is still up.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.680]   Do you have additional comments?
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.680]   No.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   Okay.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.680]   Lady Geek.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.680]   Okay.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.680]   Hello.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.680]   Okay.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.440]   Diane, I'll lower your hand then.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.720]   Okay.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:16.440]   So the difference, there's three different things that get confused, not with my mom,
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:24.200]   but when my husband was alive, there is a, I had a, it was a standby, a power of attorney
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:30.040]   for legal financial things, and then there's a medical power of attorney, but there's also
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:37.320]   when he was a frequent flyer to the hospital ER, they really don't care about POA.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   As a spouse, I have automatic legal rights, or actually I didn't even, I don't believe
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.520]   I, they actually said, do you have power of attorney, yeah, and I brought it in, and all
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:55.840]   they did was copy Xerox, the nurse on staff or the physician on staff would just take
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:01.600]   my POA, run it in through the copier, staple it and hand it back to me, he says, okay,
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.600]   you're good.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:09.560]   Nobody reads that, but as a spouse, I have, I do have legal rights to admit him, and I
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.640]   was doing that, well, maybe I did show it, but either way, I was doing that, but medical
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.640]   directives.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:21.400]   In Pennsylvania, there's a standard form called the Pennsylvania Order for Life Sustaining
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:26.360]   Treatment, the PULSE form, I believe that's standard in many states, it is a doctor's
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:31.440]   order, you can change it as many times as you want, nobody reads a legal document, these
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.720]   are doctor's orders, you sit down with the case manager, with the nurse, with the physician,
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:40.080]   you sit down one-on-one and say, what do you want, what do you want to do with your husband?
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:46.320]   They go, DNR, do this, do that, oh, by the way, never do feeding tubes, that is inhumane,
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:52.720]   but the, so, yeah, I've seen it done, I was pissed.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:59.080]   So the, so what he's saying, it's just separate out the process, if, when you need a medical
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:04.220]   thing, you're in a hospital, or a doctor's office or something, they, you fill out the
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:08.240]   PULSE form, the order, a doctor order for life-sustaining treatment, then you tell the
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:13.360]   person what do you want to do, you're done, they don't care anything about the legal documents,
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:19.240]   they might ask for POA later on, that's about it, so just be clear that when you fill out,
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.920]   when you're, when you pay a lawyer to fill out these documents, at least the person who's
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.560]   going to need to use them can read them, and then take care of it for you under their own
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:38.040]   POA, so that, that's what I wanted to mention from, from doing this many times.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:46.160]   I did it for my mom, I believe, as her daughter, but, and again, I brought in my POA, which
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:52.120]   was actually a, was not adorable, it was a standby POA, with the condition that she have
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:56.780]   two medical, signed medical statements from her doctors saying she was incompetent for
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:01.120]   financial decisions, I got, I easily got those, that's when she was admitted to memory care,
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.680]   I admitted her under that POA, they, that became, it becomes durable when that happened,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:11.480]   I forget they call it springing POA or whatever, but, so that's what I wanted to say about
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:17.720]   POAs, there's, there's legal things, and there's practical things, oh, sorry, about the bank
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:23.080]   POAs, I actually did have a bank form years ago, when I signed one for my mom when she
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:31.040]   first moved into her CCRC, at the local bank, I went back as, you know, trying to modify
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.160]   her accounts, and they refused that, and they wanted, now they said they don't, they no
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:42.240]   longer use bank POAs, they want the real POA, Xeroxed it, copied it, and then they sent
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.680]   off to their, whatever the bank's legal guys say, and they turn around, they said, yeah,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.080]   you're good, fill it in, so I'm good to go, so I don't think banks are using their own
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.880]   forms anymore, okay, that's all I had to say.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:46:03.000]   Okay, thank you, Lady Geek, Tiana, you may be muted, you appear muted.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:11.040]   I'm the person that Miriam had read the note about, banks accept the POAs, and the medical
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:18.540]   people don't care, so the reason I said that was last year, I have one sister that has
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:25.320]   a POA, and I have the POA for my mom, who's 100 now, and my other sister does not have
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:32.400]   a POA, so the other sister took my mom from the hospital to a nursing home, and put her
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:40.360]   in a nursing home, and then signed it as, she said, I have a POA, so she signed it,
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:47.160]   and it wasn't like the medical part, it was the, are you the person responsible for paying
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:56.200]   bills if she can't, so it was, you know, they should have asked for the copy of the power
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:01.880]   of attorney, and in their document, they say, we will ask within 24 hours for a copy of
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:09.800]   your POA, but they never did, so there's my mom in the nursing home, and we didn't have
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:16.540]   what you call the medical power of attorney, so in that case, my mom would be the person
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:22.360]   that has the full authority to make her own medical decisions, so everything went wrong
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.840]   in that case, and I don't know if anyone has any comments.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:42.420]   Regarding the contract, I know when I put my parents into assisted living, I didn't
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:48.200]   have to have a power of attorney to sign the contract for them to enter the facility, I
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:53.320]   just took on the financial responsibility for them, so I don't know if you need the
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   POA necessarily for that.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:04.240]   Deanna, has the nursing home followed up to obtain a copy?
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.880]   No, that was last year, and she was there for like three weeks, I think.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:16.740]   The thing that Bill said, I forgot, what did you say, Bill?
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:23.220]   I think you mentioned your sister signed the contract for the nursing home.
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:30.540]   But in this part of their contract, it specifically said, are you signing this as power of attorney,
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.100]   so you could sign it as the person taking on the responsibility, you would sign it on
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.820]   a different line, but if you sign it as power of attorney, then they're supposed to ask
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:44.660]   you a document, so basically, you're hoping that just an average person couldn't just
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:51.140]   throw your mom in a nursing home, but they can.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:56.140]   And we didn't know if we could get her out again very easily, because we didn't have
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:03.220]   the medical power of attorney, so it was like, someone can do something, but we can't undo
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.320]   it very easily.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:09.260]   If we had the medical power of attorney, my other sister or I probably could have gotten
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.980]   her out immediately.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:16.620]   But because of that, we had to go through like a three-week process to get her back
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:21.420]   out again, so yeah.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.460]   Wow.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:30.380]   Any other questions or comments regarding what we've covered so far?
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:31.380]   Allen.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:39.940]   Yeah, I was just going to say, for many of us, our elderly parents may have had a durable
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:45.040]   power of attorney and healthcare surrogate, and all these documents completed many, many
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:50.080]   years ago, even over decades ago, so it's certainly worth reviewing in advance.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:56.360]   There may be newer formats and state legislation that requires additional content, as Miriam
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:00.920]   said, and it's prudent to review that on a regular basis.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:08.200]   I know recently, when my mother took ill, I contacted her attorney, and we in fact updated
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:13.960]   her powers of attorney and everything, in addition to her will, but he said that what
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:19.460]   we had was really totally outdated and had just been sitting in a lockbox all these years,
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:26.060]   so that's something else to be proactive with.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:30.320]   Do you recall the material differences?
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:35.880]   In our case, there was some language that the state of Florida wanted in the more current
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:36.880]   version.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:37.880]   I don't recall the specifics.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:43.400]   I know it was probably a couple of pages longer than the original one.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:48.660]   I didn't compare the two, but he reassured me that what we have is current, and I will
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:50.160]   ultimately have power.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:53.940]   I already have durable power of attorney for her.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:57.720]   Haven't had any issues as yet, but I haven't had to do much with it as yet.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.720]   Okay.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.720]   Miriam.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.720]   Thank you, Alan.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.720]   Yes.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:09.420]   I wanted to ask Lady Geek, on the POLST, the Provider Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment,
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:12.920]   how does that differ from the living will?
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.720]   Nobody looks at the living will?
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.320]   Well, what is the living will, first of all?
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   The living will is your life-sustaining treatment, what you wish for life-sustaining treatment.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.320]   What you wish.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.000]   It's called an advanced healthcare directive.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Right.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   And you sign that.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:38.200]   The elderly person signs that ahead of time, and it is then notarized, I guess, whatever
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.720]   the state requires.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.440]   But how does that differ, then, from the POLST?
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:48.840]   The POLST is a doctor order they must follow.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:53.960]   The advanced healthcare directive is a legal document that somebody looks at and interprets.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:58.600]   So the doctor's orders is immediate, it's effective, everybody knows what to do, and
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   they will follow it.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:05.080]   You can update that as many times as you want, while that person stays there, but I've never
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:10.000]   been asked for the advanced healthcare directive, because I've always filled out that form,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.560]   and they were very clear, it's a one-on-one interaction, they explain everything, and
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.560]   I sign it.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:21.960]   I think I sign it as patient representative, or I sign my name Lady Geek POA, or something
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.760]   like that.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:30.520]   And then, of course, they have the copy of the actual POA that people never read.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:36.520]   But they say being a spouse, or being a daughter, immediate family, goes a long way.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:45.080]   If it was a friend, an unmarried partner, you'd have a lot more to prove, I would think.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.680]   Or more disrelevance.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.800]   Okay.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   Thank you, Lady Geek.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.160]   Diane, and then Sarah.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:59.320]   A POST is very different, in my experience, from a power of attorney, a medical power
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.320]   of attorney.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:06.080]   A medical power of attorney can be very explicit, talking about what you want, in any number
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:10.280]   of circumstances, and you can evoke it.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.320]   A POST, you have three choices.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:21.640]   I want full care, I want intermediate care, maybe if this happens, I want to do this,
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.120]   or I do not want any resuscitation.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:34.960]   A POST is absolutely 100% clear about what you want.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:38.840]   And a durable power of attorney is like, these are your wishes.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:45.040]   And so, I've heard it said that you don't need a POST until you get older.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:53.280]   I think because of the fact that you can choose, I want full code, I want everything, that
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.840]   people should have a POST.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:54:04.560]   I know, I'm older, I live in a facility where ambulances may come once or twice a week.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.280]   They always want to see the POST.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.960]   Some people feel as though when they're younger, they don't need a POST.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:23.280]   I don't understand the downside of having one, but it is much more direct and explicit
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:28.360]   and covers the situation.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:32.560]   So I would 100% recommend a POST.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.660]   Okay, thank you, Diane.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:43.960]   So maybe something for the crowd to noodle on is downsides to a POST, as Diane mentioned,
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.120]   not knowing what the downsides are.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:50.200]   So if folks have an experience with the downside, they can share it later.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.120]   So Sarah, and then Beverly and Tim.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:55:03.280]   So, yes, advanced directives are often expressing your wishes, but they are not physician's
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:08.940]   orders or providers or licensed independent practitioners orders.
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:14.680]   And the medical world works off of protocols and orders.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:19.760]   So you can go into a hospital and somebody will read your advanced directives and say,
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.320]   is the DNR all right?
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.780]   And they'll say yes, and they write the order for the DNR.
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:29.200]   And that ceases to exist when you go out, when you're discharged from the hospital.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:34.980]   Physician's order for life-sustaining treatment is so long as you can present it to a provider,
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:37.080]   then they need to follow that order.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:42.320]   And so when the EMTs arrive at your house, the paramedics, and they're going to work
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:48.280]   off a protocol and you say, here's the POST, absolutely positively do not do chest compressions,
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.280]   they go, okay.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   No, they don't.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.280]   Well, yes, let me rephrase.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:58.640]   That's what they're supposed to do.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:05.700]   If it's a physician's order for life-sustaining treatment, but not if it's an advanced directive.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:09.060]   Because otherwise, if it's an advanced directive, they're working off of their protocols and
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.320]   their protocols are to intervene.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:20.520]   There's actually a fairly good thread on this in Bogleheads recently, yeah.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:27.080]   Is that Taylor's thread on pros and cons of do not resuscitate?
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.920]   I think so.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:32.800]   There was also another one, but I think that may be the one you're talking about.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:37.480]   Lady Geek, it's topic 412455.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:45.200]   If you can put that on the chat, perhaps.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:52.580]   So Jim Dolly, who is an emergency room physician, was also one of the people who made comments
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:53.580]   about that.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:57:03.180]   And he's talked about, well, when you have somebody in the emergency room, and it's pretty
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:08.860]   clear that resuscitation has been requested not to happen, they'll back off.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:14.420]   But the problem is really more like if you're in the field and there's no physician around,
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.820]   they're working off of protocols.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:25.660]   Or those advanced directives don't follow the patient, like my mom went from a hospital
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:33.900]   setting where the advanced directives were there, they knew what not to do chest compressions
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:41.580]   or try to resuscitate, but then she went to rehab and for some reason, those directives
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:53.380]   didn't follow her there, and they did initially do take resuscitation measures.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.580]   So that's something to just think about.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:56.580]   Okay.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.580]   Thank you, Bill.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.820]   Diane, your hand is still up.
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:02.260]   I don't know if that's intended.
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:06.580]   It wasn't intended, but let me say something.
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:18.300]   There are a lot of questions about end-of-life and DNR, and do you or do you not call 911
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:22.920]   if you have a post order?
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:30.420]   Do they have to, if you call them because you're in distress, but maybe you're not critical
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:40.540]   from the condition, each emergency service operates in a different way, and it's something
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:44.180]   I think that people really need to think about.
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:50.740]   And all of these things, until you're older, until you've experienced them, you don't think
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:51.740]   about them.
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:58.180]   And there's always little, for instance, one of the things, if you go to what they call
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:06.620]   drive-by surgery, if you're doing outpatient surgery, they do not have to follow, in almost
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:15.920]   every case, your DNR, because it's a short term, they don't have resuscitated capacity,
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:19.700]   and so they will not follow your DNR.
[00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:29.460]   If you go into surgery, you have a DNR, you have to, in most cases as a condition of surgery,
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.720]   you have to stop that.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:37.820]   No physician wants to go into surgery and says, if you go into heart failure, I'm just
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.820]   going to let you die.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:49.860]   It's so complex, and so all I can say is investigate, investigate, investigate, and talk to your
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:58.180]   family members, talk to your loved ones, figure out what it is they need, figure out what
[00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:01.940]   you can do to advocate for them.
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.980]   I recently had an experience with my best friend.
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:13.980]   I was absolutely 100% sure she was 100% sure of what she needed, what she wanted, major
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:17.740]   teaching hospital, major city.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:24.260]   I had four days of doctors calling me and saying, we want surgery, and other doctors
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.980]   saying, I don't think she's competent.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:32.780]   I actually had to call in and threaten a lawyer.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:40.340]   Just investigate, talk to your loved ones, figure out everything that's going on.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.620]   It's so complex.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:46.980]   Make sure you know what you want and what your loved ones want.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:47.980]   >> Okay.
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.980]   Thank you, Diane.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.980]   Beverly and Tim?
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.660]   >> Hi.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:57.460]   I want to make a few comments because I used to work in healthcare, and I can tell you
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:02.900]   that I never read anybody's advance directive, and I never really got documentation.
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:06.420]   If somebody said I'm the husband or the wife or the mother or the father, I just believed
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:11.860]   them because it wasn't my job to really vet them.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:16.700]   I think that an advance directive is vague, to say I don't want to be resuscitated is
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:22.100]   not that meaningful, whereas a POST, which I'm from New Jersey, and POST started here,
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:28.020]   so the Physician's Order of Life Sustaining Treatment, is a legal document in a hospital.
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:33.780]   Even if you get discharged in that hospital system, and now there's not just one hospital,
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:36.900]   but there are a lot of hospitals in a conglomerate, right?
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:41.380]   Every time you sign in, that document pops up first.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:46.340]   If you say I don't want to be resuscitated, does that mean you don't want chest compressions?
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:49.060]   Does that mean you don't want a ventilator?
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.140]   There's a lot of things that that could mean.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:56.540]   The POST is specific, because for my own mother, she said, "If I get pneumonia, I don't want
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.780]   to be on a ventilator."
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:01.420]   Okay, but do you want oxygen if it'll make you feel comfortable?
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.780]   Yes, I don't want a feeding tube.
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:09.860]   Okay, so there are various things that you can agree to or not agree to, and you can
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.980]   say why, and you can be very specific.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:18.700]   I'd encourage people to get a POST because then you have more power, and if you are at
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:22.540]   a surgery center, it doesn't matter if you're in an emergency room.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:27.140]   If you're in a nursing home, it carries weight and credibility with the medical staff, and
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:33.220]   they do need to follow that, whereas an advanced directive, it's kind of wishy-washy whether
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:38.780]   or not, and nobody has the time ... In a crisis, nobody's going to read it anyway.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:44.740]   They do the best they can in a crisis, but an order is an order, so it's a good thing
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:50.340]   to have that on record, and put down exactly what you want it to say and why.
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.660]   I always tell patients, "You can change your mind at any point.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.940]   We can rewrite this.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:03:00.500]   Tomorrow, if you decide that you don't want oxygen, we'll write it."
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:05.300]   I think you should feel comfortable if you have that in your medical record.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:10.060]   Thank you, Beverly and Tim.
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.060]   Alan?
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.060]   Yes.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:18.100]   I put a link in the chat, at least for the state of Florida, and I suspect many others.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:24.460]   The state has an official DNR document signed by a physician, especially for individuals
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:32.180]   that are still living at home, perhaps with terminal illnesses, and it's printed out on
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.180]   yellow paper.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:37.660]   I actually have one here that I have already printed out for my mother, who's terminally
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:43.580]   ill, and it's supposed to be filled out, signed by the physician, and taped to the refrigerator
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:48.780]   in a common area where it can be found quickly if paramedics are called to the home or another
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:55.580]   caregiver has to intervene and sees that the patient is unresponsive, so it's quite clear
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:04:01.060]   what their advanced directives and do not resuscitate wishes are.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:05.780]   That's something to look into for each of your individual states.
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.940]   That can be certainly helpful when somebody wishes to remain at home.
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:15.140]   Alan, is the DNR order the same thing as the PULST?
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:20.940]   I'm not familiar with the PULST, but I presume it's the same thing.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:28.140]   The PULST comes from the doctor, is that right, Beverly?
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.180]   That's correct.
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:35.060]   You sit down with your physician, you sign that, so DNR is not that meaningful, because
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:39.860]   do not resuscitate could mean not shocking somebody, not giving them compressions, there's
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.960]   a whole range of things.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:49.180]   If you have one DNR while you're hospitalized, when you're discharged, it goes away.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:52.740]   If you have a PULST, it continues on.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.700]   Like I say, it's always on file for you.
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:01.880]   Every time you sign into that hospital system, or even if you call paramedics, when they
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:05.380]   type in your name and social security number, bam, that thing pops up.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.260]   That's the first thing that they see, what they can and can't do for you.
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:14.420]   That may be state specific, because I know my experience in Florida, I had submitted
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:17.940]   when my mother first went to the hospital a couple of years ago, I submitted her advanced
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:22.100]   directives and so forth, and when she was most recently admitted, they asked me if we
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.140]   had such a document.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.580]   I said, "Yes, it's been submitted."
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.860]   They did not have any record of it.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.060]   We had to start all over again.
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:32.980]   Then once you went to another facility within the same system, they did not have a copy
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:35.440]   of what we had just submitted two weeks previously.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:41.120]   No, only the PULST, because if it's a do not resuscitate order, the minute you're out of
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.480]   that system, the minute you're discharged, it goes away.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.680]   Even if you are, there's certain facilities have, it's only good for 72 hours or whatever.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.600]   It has to be renewed periodically.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.440]   Is this something universal to all states, or is that something more specific to yours?
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.440]   I've never heard of it.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.440]   I'm a retired physician.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.440]   No, PULST, P-U-L-S-T.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:05.960]   It started in New Jersey, but I recently spoke with, it's in Pennsylvania and other states
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960]   as well.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960]   That's a doctor's order.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960]   I believe it is in Florida.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:15.560]   The DNR is also an order, but it's only specific to that hospitalization.
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:21.800]   One thing is that the DNR you create when you do your estate planning or your elder
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:27.520]   care planning, along with the health directives, it's like the living will.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:32.900]   You do that with an attorney and it may be signed with notaries, but it sounds to me
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:40.160]   like the PULST is a medical paper that is done in the hospital with the attorneys when
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.200]   you are in the hospital for some reason.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.360]   Would that be correct to say that?
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:49.320]   No, the PULST is not just when you're in the hospital.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:56.080]   The PULST in my community, you put it in a place for medical text.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:04.120]   The problem is if you have a PULST that says DNR and you call 911, you are at the mercy
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.640]   of the person that shows up.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:11.080]   They can or cannot decide.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:15.160]   You can have, they will say, why did you call 911?
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.520]   What is it that you want?
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:20.360]   Your loved one that is standing there is going to say, what are they going to say?
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:24.560]   I call 911, I don't want you to do procedures.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.720]   I want you to do X, Y, and Z.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:34.400]   It's a very controversial area and people need to figure out exactly what they need.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:42.520]   And if they have a PULST that in effect says do not resuscitate, why call 911?
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.200]   You need to figure this out.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:49.240]   But a PULST is not something you create with your attorney and have it notarized along
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:53.800]   with your living will, your power of attorney, your financial powers of attorney when you're
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:59.880]   in the document creating and signing session with your attorney.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.520]   The PULST is not done then, is that correct?
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.900]   I have never seen a PULST in that realm.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:11.120]   It's something that your physician initiates or you initiate with your physician.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.000]   I have not seen any legal or lawyer ramifications.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   Beverly?
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.400]   No, the DNR, while it's a legal document, it doesn't have to be, it can't be recognized
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:28.320]   in the hospital until a physician writes a DNR order with the family or the patient.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:34.480]   The PULST is a medical order and it must be recognized and it must be recognized by EMS,
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.800]   emergency, wherever you are.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:43.440]   It's a physician's order as opposed to a legal document that says this is what I wish.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.680]   But that's one step.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.000]   If you're alert and awake and when you get to the hospital, you can say I'd like to sign,
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.280]   I'd like my physician to write a DNR order that will be recognized by the hospital.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:59.040]   But a DNR that you write in an attorney's office is not the same as a medical person
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.040]   would.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.640]   So you bring in a DNR and then the doctor signs it with his order.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.520]   Ideally, it must be recognized.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:14.560]   But what I'm saying, and this may be just true in California, when you call 911 and
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:21.840]   you have a DNR and a PULST, they're going to say, why did you call me?
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.640]   And it's between your loved one and the EMTs what they're going to do.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:36.720]   And, you know, you can, so you need to understand if you have do not resuscitate PULST, should
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.520]   you call 911.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:46.160]   It's very difficult because you may have a terminal condition, but you also may have
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.680]   a short term condition that you need relief for.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:55.160]   It takes a lot of thought.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:00.500]   Ideally all of this should function legally, but it always does not.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:06.920]   The hospital should recognize your power of attorney, your medical power of attorney.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:13.200]   They should recognize as an advocate, your PULST.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:21.160]   I just recently had an experience as a large major teaching hospital, took me five days
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:29.820]   in a threatening an attorney to get them to honor my friend's PULST.
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:36.040]   Not as smooth as it should be, educate yourselves.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:43.520]   I just Googled and the PULST exists at some level in 50 states and Washington DC.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:49.040]   So yes, it is valid with some tweaks in all of the states.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.000]   I just found, I just posted the one, I just Googled it real quick and found the one for
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   Florida.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   I'll give you an example.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.560]   I spoke to the social worker when my mother was first hospitalized and diagnosed with
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   terminal cancer and they referred me to the yellow sheet for the do not resuscitate to
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.000]   hang on the fridge at home.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   Never mentioned PULST.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.960]   I never even heard of it until this evening, but in fact it does exist for Florida as well
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.960]   and I found it and I'm going to follow up and have her fill that out.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.680]   It goes into more detail with more options than does the standard basic DNR.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:29.920]   If you have any questions, Miriam knows how to contact me, so PM me, it's fine and good
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.920]   luck with everything.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:39.200]   Thank you, Diane, Beverly, Alan, Miriam and did I miss someone?
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.920]   So going back to, I think all of these things as Lady Geek mentioned, kind of work in parallel.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:52.720]   So I'll just go over the categories again to fuel the discussion for any other comments
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.080]   or questions.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:59.080]   So taking care of an aging parent, we started with, we segued into elder care planning,
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.000]   including power of attorney.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.480]   We certainly discussed health directives and proxies as well as living wills.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.760]   I'm not sure we use that term, so we can revisit it if it helps.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:16.920]   And then the last two categories, guardianships, which was mentioned but not discussed, custody
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:23.640]   and handling incapacitation, and the last category, end of life situations, including
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.480]   prepaid funeral.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:33.240]   So we're at a quarter after nine and if folks have questions or experiences or guidance
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:42.460]   or helpful thoughts on any of these topics, feel free to chime in.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:48.840]   I would like to say one thing that I previously was not aware of, you can have all of these
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:57.600]   documents in place, you or your loved one can require surgery, your surgeon most likely
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:05.560]   will say, we need to suspend your DNR, we need to suspend your post, I will not go into
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:11.400]   surgery with the edict that I cannot revive you.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:16.480]   My friend had a do not intubate.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:19.960]   She went into surgery, they intubated her.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:24.840]   It allowed her to survive the surgery.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.160]   But then she deteriorated.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:36.640]   So you need to -- what you need to do is understand every single ramification.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:43.900]   You need to understand you can have all of these things in place, but your surgery.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:49.680]   Do you want to say if my heart stops on the table?
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.680]   Don't resuscitate me.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:55.340]   I'm not sure any surgeon would go ahead and perform the surgery.
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:14:04.680]   So again, it's just education, education, figure out as much as you can ahead of time
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.680]   for you and for your loved ones.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680]   >> Okay.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.880]   Lady geek has her hand up.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.880]   Thank you, Diane.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:19.980]   >> Funerals, prepaying.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:25.840]   Let me post a link to what happened when my husband died.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:36.160]   It's happened the first time.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160]   Okay.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.160]   Okay.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.160]   It explains the story in the first post of what happened.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:47.680]   When my husband was passing, right before he died, he said time to make funeral arrangements.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:54.500]   And because of prior -- I heard from people that they can increase -- you pay a fixed
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:15:01.220]   price, but they can charge you with the cost increase, which they can do.
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:08.960]   So first experience, which I posted about the -- I posted the link in the chat, was
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:15.000]   where I purchased an insurance contract that they will cover all the additional costs.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.180]   So it turns out he passed away about a month or so later.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:22.020]   And the guy who sold it to me was an insurance salesman.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:24.200]   I asked him, how much money are you making on this?
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:27.260]   He says 30 bucks.
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:34.140]   But what happened was that when my husband passed, the cost of the value of the contract
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.340]   -- I mean, it was only a couple months.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:39.780]   The cost of the contract was -- he made basically a $50 profit.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:44.620]   So I negotiated with him for extra copies of the death certificates.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:49.680]   So I mean, here I am, my husband passes away, and I'm negotiating with the funeral director
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.320]   for death certificates over the cost.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.540]   And hey, I'm a global ed, but I don't know.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:16:01.360]   I think he -- I don't know whether he was insulted or laughing hysterically at someone
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.360]   who would do this.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.500]   So I got the death certificates.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:14.780]   The second time, the prepaid for my mom was done like 10 or -- oh, 1997?
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:16.500]   Way back.
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:23.640]   And looking at the cost, and I went to the same funeral home, and yes, they can pay -- so
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:30.400]   the difference was for the religious service person, and it was an extra $600.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.480]   So I just paid it, and very nice service.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.000]   So that's my experience with prepaying.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.980]   So yes, they can charge, and they do charge a cost above and beyond the contract.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:48.500]   And actually when I read, I actually had a copy of my mom's -- my parents' original documents
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:53.320]   for the funeral home and for the cemetery, and it said prices -- there was a print in
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:57.920]   there that said prices valid through the end of December 1998 or whatever.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.220]   It was that old, 2000-something.
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.620]   So they can charge.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:09.000]   So I say I have an option if you guys are really -- this insurance contract, which I
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:17.180]   linked to in the chat, or just suck it up and pay the difference when the time arises.
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:18.180]   >> Okay.
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:21.460]   Thank you, Lady Geek.
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:27.380]   Any other questions or comments, insights, personal situations to share that others may
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:30.340]   learn from?
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:34.500]   Personal situations to share that you want to ask a question about?
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.500]   Alan?
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.500]   >> Yes.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:44.100]   One of the things to consider also, assuming if an elderly parent or certainly when they're
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:49.180]   approaching end of life, if you have power of attorney, both financial and otherwise,
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:54.080]   in reviewing all their finances, maybe they have a trust in place, certainly there will,
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.620]   one must also plan to ensure that there's going to be enough sufficient cash on hand
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.520]   to take care of final expenses and how that's going to be handled.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:11.040]   For instance, in my case, my mother had POD or TOD beneficiaries on all of her accounts,
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.500]   and that would have been problematic if upon her death, all the money is immediately -- the
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:23.680]   accounts are all frozen and distributed accordingly with basically the beneficiaries would have
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:28.520]   to pony up money on their own to cover final expenses down the road, assuming that all
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.400]   the siblings or beneficiaries are willing to do so.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:37.640]   So that's a consideration to think about when you're reviewing end of life care and financial
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.840]   planning.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:45.040]   The funny thing is, I spoke to her estate planning attorney for some guidance, and he
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.440]   basically said, "I can't advise you on the financial aspect on the accounts.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:56.100]   You need to talk to a financial advisor or a CPA," in spite of him having drafted her
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.760]   will and so forth.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.440]   So we're in the process of doing that.
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:03.720]   But just one consideration that may fall through the cracks if you don't think about it.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:10.560]   >> Well, Alan, why would a POD take a long time?
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:19.320]   I know the accounts are frozen immediately, but for my sister's-in-law, if you go in immediately,
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:22.400]   they can unfreeze them within a day.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:27.920]   >> Well, in my mother's case, she has a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren that
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.600]   she wants monies distributed to.
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:39.640]   She doesn't have a trust, but myself and my two siblings are all the POD/TOD, so there's
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:42.400]   no money available to make that distribution.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.840]   We'd have to basically all pony up the money on our own, as well as how to cover her final
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.840]   expenses.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:54.400]   She has a minimal amount in her checking account, and we need to basically reserve enough money
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:20:03.480]   to take her final expenses, as well as distributions for her wishes to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:08.040]   Whatever is left will then be divvied up amongst our siblings.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.800]   >> Okay.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   Thank you, Alan.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.080]   Jim, and then Deanna, and then Diane.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:18.080]   >> I just wanted to mention my father-in-law passed away last year, and he was a veteran
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.200]   and wanted a military burial, and I'm going to share the screen here.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:30.520]   We ended up, the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, which looks like this, the pictures,
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.520]   handles everything.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:38.080]   I mean, you can show up with a casket or cremains, and they can do above ground or in these things.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.120]   I forget what these things are called.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:41.120]   >> Crypts.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.120]   >> Crypts.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.120]   Very nice.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:48.040]   And they have an honor guard, a military attachment comes over, does a very nice honor guard.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:53.520]   Honorable ceremony, and they actually did a gun salute, and they gave us the shell casings,
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.520]   which was nice.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.520]   Really nice.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:59.280]   So, anyway, if you have a veteran and they would want to do this, these cemeteries are
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.680]   located all over the country.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:07.080]   >> Thank you, Jim.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.480]   Deanna.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:12.520]   >> This is based on what Alan just said.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:19.760]   So, yesterday I went to one of my mom's banks, and the woman there has been helping me with
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:27.080]   some of the power of attorney stuff and processes for my mom to be able to keep getting access
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.560]   to her accounts.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:36.720]   And so she suggested that my mom might want to put me on as like the secondary owner of
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:43.080]   the checking account so that it would -- it sounds like that would fix the problem that
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:49.940]   Alan was talking about, that suddenly everything's frozen and no one has any money, so that I
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:55.520]   probably should then use that as what happens in that circumstance.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.940]   And I don't know what you mean by enough money in there, Alan, but --
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:02.080]   >> Yeah, we actually did that.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:09.880]   I'm now a joint -- named jointly on her checking account, but it's not sufficiently funded
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:13.240]   currently, and we're going to address that, how to get it sufficiently funded to cover
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.240]   all the needs.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.880]   >> And can you give me more specifics?
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:22.960]   What does it mean specifically, or sufficiently funded?
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:23.960]   What would you guess?
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:30.760]   >> Well, in her case, she wants -- the money is distributed for her -- some of her heirs
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:34.200]   that would be over $100,000.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:40.160]   So I need to have that available to take care of as the executor of her estate, whereas
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:48.280]   all of her investment accounts are TOD or POD for myself and two siblings.
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:55.520]   So we need to basically reserve sufficient funds to cover her other wishes for distribution
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.840]   to heirs.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:03.280]   And the question would be, for instance, if she passes, prior to my telling Fidelity,
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.800]   for instance, where her accounts are at, prior to saying, could I transfer money -- because
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:12.520]   I have power of attorney -- could I transfer money from her account to her checking account
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.720]   prior to telling them that she has passed?
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:20.520]   That could be one option, just the day that she passes, to make a massive transfer or
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.560]   initiate a massive transfer.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:27.120]   I don't know ethically and legally if that's okay, and I'm not sure if that would even
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.120]   work.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.120]   But that was one option.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120]   >> Yeah.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:35.920]   >> Well, then, are you also considering the, like, say, medical bills that are built up
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:36.920]   or something?
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:37.920]   >> That, too.
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.680]   Any additional costs.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.840]   She has a long-term care policy, but we're paying out of pocket and getting 80% of it
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:48.800]   reimbursed, so there will be ongoing expenses where the estate is responsible for.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   >> Okay.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.800]   Thanks.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.680]   >> Deanna, we are doing this now for my sister-in-law, and one thing to be careful about is that
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:59.760]   we have found that the different banks do have different rules.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:04.800]   For example, my sister-in-law banks at a credit union.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:10.240]   There there are -- she -- my sister-in-law is the -- what they call the primary on the
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.240]   account.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:14.720]   There are three joints.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:21.160]   But as soon as the sister-in-law dies, the credit union says they are notified immediately
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:24.880]   by Social Security, Medicare, the hospital, the bank.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:29.040]   The big brother tells them immediately that she has passed away.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:39.040]   The account is immediately frozen, and one of the joints has to come in with their identification
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.440]   to open up the account.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:46.520]   Then the account is unfrozen for 60 days, and any of the joints can take money out,
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:49.480]   and you can use the money then to pay for things.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:54.880]   At that point, the account will be permanently frozen, and the joints have to go put their
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.120]   money somewhere else in a different account.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:01.600]   However, what do you need the money for?
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:07.100]   In her case, it would be to pay the mortgage, because if the account is frozen, the mortgage
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:13.200]   on her house comes out automatically from her account, so it wouldn't be open to pay
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.200]   that.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.920]   How about Florida Power and Light, you know, the Internet?
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.560]   There are bills that come directly out of her account, so that is why we would need
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.800]   to get it opened immediately.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:29.200]   Meanwhile, we bank at Chase, and there it is different.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:35.800]   There we're like, Alan, the joints -- the account will not be frozen immediately.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:40.140]   The joint can just go in.
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:45.100]   The joint can go in and take the money out of the account.
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:49.300]   >> I'll just ask -- I'll ask her what the situation is at that bank.
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:50.300]   >> Yeah.
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:51.300]   >> Okay.
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:54.780]   Thank you, Miriam, Alan, and Deanna.
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:57.540]   Diane, your hand is up.
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:00.580]   You're muted.
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:05.980]   Diane, you appear muted.
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:13.420]   >> I posted a couple of resources for nonprofit funeral consumer associates.
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:20.020]   These are generally associations locally you can join.
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:28.380]   They survey the funeral directors in the area and will give you costs for cremation and
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:32.460]   all of the other funeral options.
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:42.380]   It's -- again, I always would prefer nonprofit, and so when your loved one dies, you contact
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:48.860]   them or you know ahead of time the services and what they will cost in your area.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:53.260]   The other link I provided was whole body donations.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:57.340]   This is a somewhat fraught field.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:00.780]   Lots of people leave their body to a medical facility.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:08.780]   There's also a lot of commercial organizations out there.
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:13.380]   It can be a somewhat murky area.
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:20.300]   There are -- there's information about how much money can be made from selling body parts.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:28.740]   So I guess what I would say is these organizations can provide a very valuable resource.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:34.660]   Try to look for a nonprofit organization.
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:40.420]   And again, all I can say is do your research ahead of time.
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:42.380]   Talk to your loved ones.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:46.820]   Know exactly what you want.
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:50.500]   Know exactly what your resources are.
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.140]   Plan ahead.
[01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:55.700]   Know what your resources are.
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:56.700]   >> Okay.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:59.740]   Thank you, Diane.
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:06.220]   In the absence of other questions or comments, I'll share a quick -- folks probably know
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:09.940]   of Charlie Munger, so Warren Buffett's right hand.
[01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:14.300]   He turns 100 in January and he's still going strong.
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:21.100]   He often quips that the only thing he wants to know is where he's going to die so that
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:25.860]   he doesn't go there.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:34.340]   Along the lines of what folks are saying, what do folks think in terms of practical
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:37.780]   actionable takeaways from this sort of meeting?
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:38.780]   And I love how it's going.
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:46.500]   I was just feeling grateful that folks' comments are focused and concise and pointed and helpful.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:51.460]   Are there -- you know, whether it's physical activity, we all know, you know, eat healthy
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.180]   and exercise.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:58.400]   In terms of cognitive decline or just staying healthy, how to put off all of these things
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.500]   that we're talking about as long as possible.
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:04.060]   What have -- what has worked for folks?
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:07.380]   What have they seen work for their friends and loved ones?
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:15.500]   >> Best thing is to be born with good genes, but you have no control over that.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.500]   >> Okay.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:24.460]   >> I live in an area where there's a lot of retirees.
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:30.260]   I'm on the younger end of the spectrum, but I know several folks in their 80s, into their
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:37.020]   90s, and they're still quite active, and it's a common trait I see amongst them all is that
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:46.100]   they stay physically engaged almost every day of the week, or -- and socially engaged,
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:51.940]   so I think that's just something I observed, anecdotally.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:52.940]   >> Okay.
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:57.820]   So in addition to the physicality of it, also community.
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:59.900]   >> Yeah.
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:06.620]   >> And also, not only is Charlie Munger turning 100, but in January, Taylor Laramore, who
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:14.100]   began the Vogelheads in 1998, is turning 100 years old on January 25, and we are already
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:17.860]   planning his 100th birthday party.
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.060]   >> Fantastic.
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:22.300]   >> What keeps Taylor going?
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:30.500]   >> He once told me, he said, "I often wonder why I made it to the," you know, at that time
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:35.420]   he told me he was about 97, "How did I make it to 97?"
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:41.540]   And he said, "I think it was because after working, after being in World War II, after
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:51.100]   being in a foxhole in Belgium for several weeks in the middle of winter in World War
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:31:00.220]   II, watching people die, I came home and realized that little things don't matter, not to get
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:04.500]   upset about little things in life."
[01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:13.620]   And as we know, he, during -- on the Vogelheads Forum, he is cordial, decent, kind, helpful,
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:20.900]   you know, somebody can explode in front of him with negative comments about him, and
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:28.460]   he takes it in stride and tries to make -- tries to say something nice.
[01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:33.060]   Plus, he's extremely helpful with his financial information.
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.700]   >> Wonderful.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:37.260]   Thank you for sharing.
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:40.300]   >> He also does not even use a cane.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:44.900]   He's almost -- he's 99 years old and nine months.
[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:46.220]   He doesn't use a wheelchair.
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:47.580]   He doesn't use a cane.
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:50.140]   He doesn't use a walker.
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:52.140]   He's still 6 feet tall.
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:56.860]   He's had four bouts of cancer, which he has dealt with.
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:32:02.460]   He does credit good medical doctors.
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:06.020]   And by the way, his son has told me that he's very pushy with his doctors.
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:10.620]   You know, he doesn't want to be in that office longer than he has to be, and he wants to
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:11.620]   be seen on time.
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:14.460]   He's very, you know, time-oriented.
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:17.540]   But he does follow his doctor's orders.
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:18.540]   He goes to chemotherapy.
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:24.060]   I don't remember if it's once a week or once a month, but he still goes after his latest
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:31.420]   bout of cancer, which was hip cancer, about five years ago.
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:38.820]   He did lose his voice to lung cancer -- not lung cancer, throat cancer, maybe 20 years
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:42.820]   ago now, maybe 15 years ago.
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:48.780]   He has been through -- he's been through a lot, and he still has a good attitude, and
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:51.980]   that's what he attributes his long life to.
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:52.980]   >> Wonderful.
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:54.260]   Thanks for sharing, Maryam.
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:57.420]   It gives new meaning to stay the course.
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:04.820]   Diane, your hand is up.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:10.320]   You're muted.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:19.220]   Diane, why don't we start by unmuting, and then let us know if your raised hand is intended
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:21.020]   and if you have a comment.
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:22.020]   Okay.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:26.540]   Well, we're figuring that out.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:28.220]   So any other thoughts?
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:32.820]   It's clear physical activity, community interaction.
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:44.180]   What else have folks seen work for the folks who are active into their 80s, 90s, haven't
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:52.540]   physically or cognitively declined as much as we've seen others?
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:56.500]   >> I imagine there's some studies somewhere that suggest that those individuals who are
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:04.460]   financially secure, perhaps because of less stress, perhaps will theoretically live longer
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:10.900]   or are able to get better healthcare and utilize the resources from a life of living below
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:11.900]   their means.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:16.620]   I haven't seen studies, per se, but one would expect they exist.
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:24.260]   So maybe Bogle has, as a group, have a little better longevity and fewer cognitive issues
[01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:27.580]   down the road.
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:28.580]   >> It's a great idea.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:35.340]   >> I also know, Gauri, that a life insurance salesman, life insurance person in life insurance
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:40.460]   once mentioned that the policies are more expensive for people who are more likely to
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:46.520]   die early, and one of the factors is your job, your employment.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:56.520]   Are you working in a heavy construction zone as a person, you know, moving big barrels
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:04.560]   of concrete around or cranes, you're up on one of those big cranes hoisting large concrete
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:11.400]   barriers, or are you an attorney or an accountant sitting at a desk?
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:14.320]   >> Great point.
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:17.880]   Thank you, Miriam.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.520]   Any other questions or comments?
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:26.040]   The floor is open, and feel free to go beyond topics we've stated.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.040]   Deanna?
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.040]   >> I know.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:33.600]   I have another question.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:38.560]   Lately I've been going to different banks, giving them the power of attorney papers,
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:44.040]   and then sometimes they'll say you have power of attorney over the checking and savings
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:51.360]   but not CDs, or you have to sign this additionally or a bunch of different things.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:58.720]   So has anybody, or are there any books to read or something that would help me through
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:05.720]   this process, because each of the four banks is different, each of them counts, they don't
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:09.080]   just say you have power of attorney, you can do anything.
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:14.000]   They are kind of like, they're almost like getting in the way of I have to do one thing
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.760]   at a time or something.
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:22.520]   Now I have the checking account, but I don't have access to the CDs or things like that.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:30.000]   Do you guys have any tips?
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.860]   >> I think you simply have to go to each bank, ask them the very direct questions, and write
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:36.860]   it down.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:37.860]   >> Yeah.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:43.040]   >> If they have, ask them do you have forms for that, get a copy of the form.
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:46.800]   Are these banks that you can walk into, or are these online banks?
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:54.840]   >> Yeah, I can walk into them, although one's like 40 or 50 miles away, but I got to the
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:59.080]   point where walking into the banks was a lot better than calling them on the phone.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.080]   >> Yeah.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:06.320]   >> And then just keep separate notes for each bank, but put yourself as a joint if possible
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.040]   so you have all access to the money.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:13.320]   But again, it depends if it's your mother, correct?
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.320]   >> Yeah.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.320]   >> And she's 100 also.
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.320]   >> Yeah.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.320]   >> Third person tonight going to be 100.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:18.320]   >> She's already 100.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.320]   >> Already 100.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.320]   She'll be 101.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.320]   >> She beat the whatever guy to 100, yeah.
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.320]   >> She beat Taylor and Charlie Munger.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.320]   >> Charlie Munger.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.320]   >> Yeah.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.320]   >> Yeah.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:35.320]   Each bank is different, so just you have to write it, if each bank is, you have to write
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:36.320]   it down specifically.
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.320]   >> Right.
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:44.920]   You're sort of making a grid, like what does this bank need, what does this one need, what
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.360]   do I, what counts for this one and what counts for that one?
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:56.040]   >> And also, if they have a brochure or a book, I did find, for example, Ally Bank,
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:01.200]   which is an online bank, when you open an account at Ally, they do give you a booklet
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.120]   that they send to you, like the old days, in the mail.
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:09.040]   Well, that was interesting because in that booklet, it specifically lays out what to
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:16.480]   do and what happens when a person dies, if the account is joint, if it's TOD, Ally does
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:22.160]   allow TOD accounts, even for joint accounts, you can still have beneficiaries.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:26.400]   So that was very helpful because I saw it in writing.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:32.120]   So if you go to the bank and they say, Ally's online, but if you go to an online bank, I
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:38.640]   mean, to a physical bank, and they say, oh, no, this does not happen, you can't do this,
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:39.640]   you show them the paper.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:40.640]   >> Right.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:44.560]   >> And you say, well, this is the official Chase paper, it says I can do it.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:53.160]   >> Or maybe the officer you're speaking to is not well-trained or doesn't know.
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.160]   >> That happens.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.160]   Thanks.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:56.160]   >> Very helpful.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.160]   Thank you.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:04.280]   So some of these comments remind me of the importance, and this is both obvious but perhaps
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:10.880]   often overlooked, is the importance of having a thorough inventory of where these accounts
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:18.240]   are, contact people, just so that whoever needs to navigate the process is equipped
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:24.680]   and not unearthing things blindly.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:32.480]   So Miriam, I know some other questions may have been submitted via the RSVP.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.240]   Anything we want to cover there?
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:38.920]   >> Another thing we didn't cover, which was submitted, had to do with guardianships.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:43.960]   They said when is an elderly guardianship appropriate?
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.480]   Has anybody here done guardianships?
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.600]   Have any of their relatives been in guardianships?
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:58.760]   My understanding is that nobody in our family has that I know of, but it's when a person
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:09.400]   perhaps does not have relatives, you might need to appoint a guardian, but to do -- my
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:15.440]   understanding is that a guardianship in Florida especially, it involves the court system.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:20.480]   So you are bringing in the court system, and a guardian will need to be appointed.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:26.760]   It can be a relative, but still, before you can do anything, you do have to file paperwork
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.920]   with the court system.
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:32.040]   Sometimes things need to be approved by a judge.
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:39.280]   So it is not easy to do that, to do a guardianship, in the sense that it involves a whole other
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:43.840]   level of administration.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.600]   But I guess if you have to do it, there's no other way.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:50.120]   >> Okay.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.120]   Thank you.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.840]   I've not been monitoring the chat, but I did notice this question, and it has a few answers,
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.000]   so maybe we can build on those if there's more to add.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.520]   So the question is, how long does it take for a trustee to access the cash in a bank
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:11.560]   or brokerage account when the trust owner is suddenly incapacitated, assuming the trustee
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.960]   is named for the situation?
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:22.800]   I'll paraphrase some of the responses in that it doesn't take long, and one maintains access.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:33.200]   But folks should feel free to build on known responses or situations.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:38.720]   Have trustees experienced barriers, or what would make it easier for the next trustee
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.440]   who finds themselves in that situation?
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.960]   Excuse me.
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:50.320]   Bill, I see you commented in response.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.080]   Do you want to elaborate on your response for the benefit of the group?
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.080]   >> Yeah.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.640]   So I saw some questions about trustees.
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:09.960]   My parents had trusts set up, and they were trustees for their trusts until they moved
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.640]   into assisted living at that time.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:18.360]   They agreed to have me take over their financial affairs, and they resigned as trustee, and
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.680]   I was appointed trustee.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:25.480]   There was some documentation that had to be done with a lawyer for that to facilitate
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.400]   that, but it was fairly smooth.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:38.120]   And once I did that, working with financial institutions, working with their existing
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.520]   institution, it was challenging.
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:47.880]   It was during the early days of COVID, and it was challenging, and I heard Miriam talk
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:54.800]   about Ally Bank, and I do have relationships there, and my parents didn't at the time,
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:43:01.760]   but they worked pretty well with trusts, so I just opened a new account, and my parents'
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:12.080]   names are online, and they were very easy to work with, and along the way, my mom passed
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:18.120]   away last year, and her accounts didn't get frozen.
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:26.840]   We just continued to pay bills out of that account as needed until probate was settled
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:28.440]   this year.
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:29.440]   >> Okay.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:32.040]   Thank you, Bill.
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:39.040]   In the absence of other questions or comments, I'll raise one that I'm curious about.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:45.600]   Having heard about CCRCs on this call, or retirement communities, or assisted living,
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:53.600]   are these places that when we're at our cognitive best rational objective that folks can move
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:44:02.240]   into, and then as cognitive abilities may decline, and we reach that form of person
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:09.700]   that is less agreeable, but needing or wanting to age in place, are these communities designed
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:16.440]   to age in place, can accommodate memory care, so that there's a middle ground that someone
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:25.580]   isn't forced to leave their situation, and can be cared for while aging in place voluntarily
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:27.460]   in a place that they've chosen?
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:32.220]   Is that part of how these are premised?
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:33.900]   And I see, Sarah, your hand is up.
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:37.900]   I don't know if it's in response to this or something new, but feel free.
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:40.060]   >> Yes, in response to this.
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:42.700]   So I'll post the link.
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:52.180]   There is an organization called CARF, C-A-R-F, carf.org, that provides voluntary certification
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:58.180]   for life plan CCRC communities.
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:05.940]   So a lot of it is just going to depend on the community and the state you live in.
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:11.540]   You know, I had a friend who had her mother in Las Cruces, New Mexico, in a CCRC way back
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:19.460]   when, and the CCRC called up one day and said, "You know, it's time we talk about your mother
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:21.660]   moving to memory care."
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:22.660]   So I've got --
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:23.660]   >> Within that facility, Sarah?
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:24.660]   Sorry to interrupt.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:25.660]   >> Yes.
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:26.660]   >> Okay.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:27.660]   >> Yes.
[01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:37.140]   So, and, you know, I'm pursuing a CCRC, but it's in a different location, which is just
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:39.740]   in a whole other bag of worms.
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:46.380]   And the original facility has independent assisted living, memory care, and a skilled
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:53.020]   nursing facility, but they have built a sister facility, which is totally separate, except
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:58.980]   for the highest level, and it has all of that except for the skilled nursing facility.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:03.700]   And they think that's okay, and that's the way the future is.
[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:15.260]   In my city, there is a new for-profit, not CARF-certified facility that is all four,
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:17.020]   but they make me really nervous.
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:23.580]   And I can also -- I keep posting on Bogleheads the thread about -- the article about you
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:27.460]   should worry about -- it's not titled this, but the basic premise is you should worry
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:30.780]   about your CCRC going bankrupt.
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:38.220]   So it is -- I mean, you're putting in a big chunk of change, and in exchange for that
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:41.860]   and whatever you pay the monthly, you're looking for them to take care of you until you no
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:49.100]   longer need care, and sometimes it doesn't work out that way.
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:50.100]   >> Okay.
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.100]   Thank you, Sara.
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:52.220]   That's very informative.
[01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:55.420]   Just a quick question, and then we'll go to Lady Geek.
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:47:00.980]   When you say the risk of them going bankrupt, how does one mitigate for that?
[01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:04.700]   Are there larger companies that are more financially stable?
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:11.700]   I know some of the REITs are in the healthcare and assisted living space, or are these large
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:15.860]   financially independent, smaller, where you just have to wonder?
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:22.060]   >> So, again, I'll post the link to CARF, and although it's pretty simple, carf.org.
[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:24.380]   And I think -- I'll double-check.
[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:28.020]   And they do have articles in there.
[01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:35.420]   And one of the things that is desirable is to investigate financially what they can do.
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:43.860]   I mean, it's sort of a -- like a pyramid scheme, frankly.
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:50.660]   And you want your car, your CCRC, it's like a lot of things.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:59.020]   You want it 90-plus percent, preferably more like 95% continuous occupancy.
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:05.980]   You want to see a long waiting list so they can maintain that occupancy rate.
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:12.980]   There are people who feel that your best bet is to go with a not-for-profit.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:15.140]   It's not easy.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:22.380]   And so they're -- so the comment in the chat, do all CCRCs require a buy-in fee?
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:31.340]   So they are divided by categories, usually just A, B, C, and I think D. A, I think, was
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:38.380]   the original model where you paid a big chunk in and you didn't get anything back.
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:43.980]   But that was to end of life, regardless of what happened.
[01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:49.700]   And then there are various other plans, but, you know, if you're getting money back, that's
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:55.500]   still a problem if your company goes bankrupt because they don't have anything to give you
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:49:00.860]   and you're low on the totem pole for getting -- the investors get money back first, which
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:04.060]   is what's worrying me about mine here in town.
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:05.060]   >> Thank you.
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:08.060]   And I'll close out the question and then to Lady Geek.
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:13.180]   Are there -- what's the incidence or frequency of these going bankrupt?
[01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:21.140]   Is it clearly a legitimate concern, but remote in terms of probabilities thus far?
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:23.620]   Or it's been happening a lot?
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:26.340]   Or with what frequency are they going bankrupt?
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:28.780]   >> I don't have a frequency for you.
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:32.580]   I do use a fee-only financial planner.
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:39.460]   She was quite concerned when she realized I was talking about doing a CCRC.
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:48.900]   The article that I'll post that she gave me also mentions, yeah, I mean, it's a risk.
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:49.900]   >> Okay.
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:51.540]   Thank you, Sarah.
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:54.860]   Lady Geek.
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:50:01.260]   >> Let's talk about getting the entrance deposit refunded, which is what I'm doing right now
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:03.500]   with my mom.
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:12.060]   First, when I helped my mom transfer into -- well, my dad died, and actually he was
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:14.380]   one of the people who said, "I'm never moving."
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:17.700]   And my mom -- I was killing my mom because she was taking care of him.
[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:19.900]   She is this very, very social person.
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:22.700]   I was killing her just to -- because she had to stay there.
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:25.260]   I said, "Mom, you would love this retirement community."
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:27.300]   And she absolutely wanted to go there.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:33.700]   But it took a while -- as soon as my dad passed, me and my sibling just -- she was there.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:38.980]   During the admission -- while she was going through the admission process into the community
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:44.860]   or purchasing her unit, one of the forms on the entrance deposit was how would you like
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:52.820]   it refunded to the estate, to beneficiaries directly, or to a charity or something.
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:51:00.540]   So we filled out the form to -- she filled out the form that the refund would go to beneficiaries,
[01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:02.500]   which includes me.
[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:05.180]   So my mom passes.
[01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:11.500]   I close out everything with the CCRC.
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:14.140]   And the entrance deposit is interesting.
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:20.660]   Because in my situation, my mom's situation, there's no -- I do not -- she has no estate.
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:26.580]   She has TOD/POD accounts, which are not part of the estate probate process.
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:29.860]   So there's no money in there to pay anything due.
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:34.860]   So what the CCRC realizes is that this happens all the time.
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:44.620]   What they are doing is any balance due, her rent, credit or debit, refund or payment,
[01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:48.060]   will be adjusted on the return of the entrance deposit.
[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:55.060]   So if she owes one month of expenses, or actually she's getting a credit for like three weeks,
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:57.180]   they will add that to the entrance deposit.
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:00.900]   So that way the beneficiaries will get paid that amount.
[01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:07.820]   So what they're doing is -- it's the category where you give them the money and they give
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:10.100]   you 90% back.
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:11.300]   That's the category she's going in.
[01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:12.300]   There's different categories.
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:14.420]   Now, how do I get that back?
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:20.020]   Well, they obviously know she passed, because it's their skilled nursing center.
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:24.380]   I did not need to supply that certificate.
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:28.820]   So what -- I read it, and I worked with the rep.
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:31.100]   You'll get it back in 90 days.
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:32.100]   Excuse me?
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:36.140]   Apparently those entrance deposits, I guess they're like escrow accounts.
[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:38.600]   It's a pool of cash.
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:42.860]   They take the -- they give their profits, goes to the general community expenses.
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:49.020]   But what they do -- it's like a bank with a -- that can do whatever they want.
[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:55.100]   They will wait until they have enough money to pay you back in that cash reserve.
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:53:01.780]   So if everybody dies and everybody gets paid, everybody leaves, they're not going to refund
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:05.940]   anyone until they get a new person coming in and giving them an entrance deposit.
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:06.940]   They will wait.
[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:08.420]   So they depend on turnover.
[01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:10.300]   They depend on capacity.
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:15.060]   So I have to -- so first of all, they're waiting 30 days for the transactions to sell.
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:16.540]   That just happened.
[01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:22.300]   So now I have to wait another 60 days to be assigned a number in the queue to get the
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:23.300]   refund.
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:26.660]   And they say, well, typically that's about 90 days.
[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:29.020]   Could be less.
[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:33.780]   But it really depends on their turnover and occupancy rate.
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:36.340]   Last year they said it was running close to 90 days.
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:38.700]   They said this year it's looking a little shorter.
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:41.540]   So I'm now in a waiting game.
[01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:46.180]   And so I just find it interesting -- I guess it's like a bank where the depositor comes
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:49.180]   in and demands their money back.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:51.260]   They can say, no, you have to wait.
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:56.420]   It is -- so if you read the residence care agreement very carefully about that entrance
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:54:01.180]   deposit, it's clearly stated there, but you don't realize what it is until you actually
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:03.300]   need to read that paragraph.
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:07.540]   So but it was an interesting form that they will adjust -- because this happens all the
[01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:10.100]   time with the state accounts, I don't have an estate account.
[01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:15.020]   They will just adjust balance due or give you a refund to the entrance deposit, the
[01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:16.020]   money you get back.
[01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:17.020]   So I thought that was really cool.
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:18.540]   I'll just get it.
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:25.700]   Now as for dying in Pennsylvania about TOD/POD accounts, I'm pushing out a link to the forum
[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:28.100]   thread I created for this.
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:29.100]   Don't die in Pennsylvania.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:35.540]   Transfer on death -- pay on death accounts are taxable as an inheritance tax.
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:38.100]   This is very, very different than an estate tax.
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:42.940]   My mom's estate tax is zero because there's nothing there to probate.
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:47.060]   The TOD/POD accounts will be taxed at 4.5%.
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:51.460]   The lineal inheritance rate in New Jersey, I understand the inheritance -- the tax for
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:57.200]   the descendants is zero for immediate descents, but in Pennsylvania, it's 4.5%.
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:08.640]   So within nine months, I must file for a Pennsylvania REV 1500, an inheritance tax form.
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:09.960]   I'll do it for my mom.
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:14.640]   The nice thing with this is that there is -- because this happens with -- like I have
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:15.640]   siblings.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:19.280]   They're split across several accounts, including the Fidelity account.
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:23.180]   So the nice thing is there's a little check box in the Pennsylvania inheritance form that
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:24.800]   says send me a bill.
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:28.080]   I give the name and address of each of the beneficiaries.
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:32.220]   I don't have to worry about a brother or sister paying me -- I don't have to foot the bill
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:33.360]   for them.
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:36.500]   So I pay my fair share of the inheritance.
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:37.500]   They pay their fair share.
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.460]   I just check the box.
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:41.560]   Not my circus, not my monkey.
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:42.760]   Family drama.
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:44.440]   Let the state deal with it.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:51.000]   And if either of the siblings fail to pay, the state is free to file a lien against their
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.760]   property.
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:53.760]   Not my concern.
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:59.520]   So I posted a thread -- I posted a link to my thread in there.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:04.880]   And apparently the Pennsylvania inheritance -- you have to notify the state of investment
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:06.200]   accounts.
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:09.680]   You do not have to notify the state for bank and savings and cash accounts.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:13.240]   But you still have to pay the taxes, which I intend to do.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:18.640]   So -- and of course, that is filed with the county of the register of wills, with two
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:19.640]   copies.
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:20.640]   They'll send a copy to the state.
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.640]   So okay.
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:22.640]   We're out of time.
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:23.640]   We've been two hours.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:31.420]   But I just want to say it's a very interesting adventure on the entrance deposit refunds.
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:35.520]   And also a more fun adventure with the state of Pennsylvania.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.400]   So I'm getting my taxpayer dollars' worth -- they're getting mine.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.400]   So okay.
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.400]   That's all I had to say.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:42.400]   >> Great.
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:43.440]   Thank you, Lady Geek.
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:46.640]   So as Lady Geek mentioned, we're two minutes after the hour.
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:55.840]   I think the quote of the evening will be Lady Geek saying, "Not my circus, not my monkey."
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:01.120]   And before we wrap, are there any closing comments or questions?
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:07.800]   Again, we're happy to take specific questions to Summerfield so that he can address them
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:13.360]   in a focused way when we reschedule.
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:16.320]   If not, thanks again to everyone for participating.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:21.120]   >> Gloria, I want to mention three upcoming meetings.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:22.120]   >> Great.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.120]   >> Okay.
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:30.720]   On November 8th, there is a meeting that Chicago is organizing with Grandma Sylvia.
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:39.280]   And Grandma Sylvia will be here, and the topic is "Surviving the Loss of a Spouse and Her
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:47.720]   Financial Journey to Financial" -- I think -- it doesn't say here, but financial -- "Her
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:53.640]   Ability to Handle Her Own Finances After Her Husband Handled All the Finances and Then
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:55.320]   Passed Away."
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:58.320]   That's Grandma Sylvia, November 8th.
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:06.160]   On November 15th, Chicago is presenting the "Health Care, ACA, COBRA, and Other Options
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:14.800]   for Pre- and Early Retirees," pre-Medicare, November 15th.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:23.080]   And then on December 13th, Chicago is hosting Lonnie Thibodeau on Medicare.
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:26.440]   He has spoken before at a meeting on Medicare.
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:27.440]   He's really great.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:29.640]   He knows Medicare inside and out.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:33.240]   And so that is December 13th.
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:40.200]   And then January, possibly the "Mad Scientist" will be back.
[01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:41.200]   And --
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:45.160]   >> To discuss his life as a recent homeowner and recent dad.
[01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:46.160]   >> Uh-huh.
[01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:51.960]   And Taylor's birthday party, 100th birthday party.
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:53.320]   >> Excellent.
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:59.760]   And we can also say the 2024 location for the Bogleheads Conference was announced.
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:03.040]   It will be Minneapolis.
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:05.000]   Probably in the October range.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.760]   I'm not certain of that, but Minneapolis is certain.
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:12.280]   They have a huge active volunteer chapter.
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:19.280]   So if folks are considering, that's where it'll be.
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:22.760]   I want to reiterate how grateful I am for this community.
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:27.920]   I find folks inspiring, just how folks help one another.
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:33.040]   And I'll say it as straight as it is, because it comes up over and over.
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:40.580]   Let's each, you know, remain active, engage in whatever exercise we can, eating healthily.
