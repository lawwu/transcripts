[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Ed Welch is the author of a wonderful book titled "Running Scared, Fear, Worry, and
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.040]   the God of Rest."
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.760]   A few years back in the offices of the Christian Counseling and Educational Foundation in Philadelphia,
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.240]   I asked him, "What does anxiety say about our spiritual condition, and how should we
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.280]   respond in moments of fear and worry?"
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.640]   Here's how Dr. Welch responded.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.360]   Mark 4 and Matthew 13 talk about the parable of the sower and the seed.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.040]   And it slips in this one little comment about how the worries of life can be one of the
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.440]   encumbrances to spiritual receptivity and spiritual growth.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.560]   So that immediately puts it high profile.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.360]   So if you're a person like myself who's real familiar with anxieties and worries, it says
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.500]   this is an important spiritual matter.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.320]   So right off the bat, it's an important one.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.640]   I think one reason the scripture identifies it as an important one is so often fears and
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.880]   anxieties create this world where the only thing that exists is myself and the threat
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.040]   to the thing that I love.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.100]   And the thing that I love could be something very good.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.100]   It's my life.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.100]   It's food.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.100]   It's sustenance.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.260]   It's my spouse.
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.440]   So it doesn't have to be a bad object necessarily.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:29.440]   But so often fears just condense life to those two things and God is functionally not there.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.760]   At least that's my own experience.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.080]   And as far as I can tell from looking at other scripture, scripture seems to suggest the
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.040]   same thing because so often one of the ways out of fears and anxieties is we have a personal
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.320]   God.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.360]   Speak with Him.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.960]   Speak with Him.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.480]   It's simple, but for those who struggle with fears and anxieties, if they find that they
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.120]   are more and more quickly able to move from this world that is very, very small, it's
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.680]   just them and their anxieties, to speaking out to the Lord, that is the mark of wonderful,
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.440]   powerful sanctification.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   Amen.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.720]   That was Dr. Ed Welch, the author of Running Scared, Fear, Worry, and the God of Rest.
