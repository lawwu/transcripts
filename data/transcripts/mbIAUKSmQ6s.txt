[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Jeremy writes in with today's question, "Dear Pastor John, I've served for the past seven
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.400]   years as a worship leader, but something I've had trouble reconciling is how worshiping
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.200]   God has been turned into singing trendy praise songs in a community setting.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.880]   Does this derive from the Levites and appointed leaders in the Old Testament?
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.740]   I have a hard time finding something relatable in the New Testament.
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.400]   In fact, one of the scriptures I find most denotes what worship is comes from Romans
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.680]   12, where Paul tells the church in Rome that worship is giving oneself completely to God.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.760]   Long question short, what brings us corporate music worship that inhabits almost every church
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.760]   today?"
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.240]   Well, let's just overlook the use of the word trendy, because I doubt that's really what
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.240]   he's asking.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.520]   I mean, I don't think he expects to find in the Bible a justification for trendy.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.280]   I think his question really is, why do we sing for half an hour in worship services
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.280]   all over the world?
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.440]   Why do we do it that way?
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.160]   So let me try to go at that and see what I can do.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:16.520]   I would define worship as anything we do which gives expression to the supreme, all satisfying
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.640]   worth of God.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.720]   That's worship.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.680]   Which would include both offering my body to be burned in martyrdom, because I'm showing
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.920]   how precious Christ is to me, that I'm willing to give up my life for him.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.200]   And it would include my singing, my heartily offering up my voice and my heart in church
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.180]   as I sing, because I'm giving expression to his worth as I sing a God-exalting song.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:55.560]   Now what makes them both worship is the experience of the heart, which treasures God above all
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560]   things.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.120]   That's the essence of worship, the experience of the heart.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.960]   Jesus says, "Your heart is far from you.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   Worship me with your lips."
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.400]   This is a zero worship.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.960]   So the essence of worship is heart, a heart that treasures God above all things.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:19.080]   The universe was created so that human beings would do everything we do and use everything
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.280]   we have to display the supreme worth of God.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.840]   And in an ideal world, all is thus worship.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.920]   Now how does it come about that today most evangelical services around the world, at
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.760]   least the parts I've been to and that I look at online, have an extended time of singing
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.360]   at the front end and preaching at the back end?
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.280]   Here's my best effort to give an account for this.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.920]   When you compare, this is the most important thing I'm going to say, this little observation
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.920]   here.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.280]   When you compare the Old Testament and the New Testament, something startling emerges
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.860]   with regard to worship.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.880]   In the Old Testament, there is an extremely detailed set of guidelines for how everything
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.280]   should be done in relationship to the tabernacle and the sacrifices and the way people come
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.640]   to God.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   In the New Testament, those details are almost completely lacking.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.960]   I'm tempted to say completely lacking.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:32.240]   There is no way anybody could construct a normative worship service from what we have
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.680]   in the New Testament.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.960]   Lots of people think they can, but I don't think so.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.360]   There's more tradition going on there than they realize.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:49.760]   My opinion about why this is so is that the Old Testament was a "com-si" religion with
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.960]   all of redemptive history focused on a culturally unified ethnic people called Israel, and the
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.360]   New Testament is a "go-tel" religion with no ethnic center, no geographic center, no
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:15.600]   cultural center, and therefore the New Testament is written so as to be a manual of theology
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   and life useful in all cultures and all the peoples of the world, which is why it should
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.200]   be translated into all the languages of the world.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.800]   If the New Testament had given detailed guidelines for what a worship service should be, it would
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.140]   have enshrined one first-century culture to be imposed on all the cultures of the world.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.560]   It would have been a colossal failure, given what God designs for His church to look like
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.840]   all over the world as it becomes embedded in and incarnate in all the cultures of the
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   world.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.140]   to explain why there's so much singing and why there is preaching.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.420]   I don't think you look for prescribed patterns in the New Testament.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:13.120]   You look for emphases, trajectories, implications, the nature of God,
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.260]   the nature of man, the nature of his mind, the nature of his emotions,
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.900]   the nature of salvation, the nature of gifts.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.840]   What you find is that there is an extraordinary centrality and emphasis
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.480]   to the Word of God in the Christian life, and there is at least one example
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:41.020]   of preaching mandated in the context of worship, 1 Timothyâ€”no, 2 Timothy 4, 1 and 2.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.420]   And, as we would expect from the Old Testament legacy of singing,
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:54.900]   there is a good bit of singing in the New Testament and pictures of it in the age to come.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.740]   And there are a couple of texts, at least, that say it should be done corporately.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.580]   Let me just give you a flavor of singing in the New Testament.
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:12.280]   Heaven in Revelation is full of song, and they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:19.820]   and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and amazing are your deeds, O Lord, the Almighty."
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.760]   Revelation 15, 3. And James says, "Is anyone among you cheerful? Let him sing."
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.440]   And Paul says, "I will sing with my spirit, and I will sing with my mind."
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.500]   And again in Colossians, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly,
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.840]   teaching, admonishing one another, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.720]   with thankfulness in your heart to God."
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.920]   And then he says the same thing, almost, in Ephesians 5,
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.820]   only here he makes it clear that it's corporate.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.860]   He says, "Be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.100]   singing and making melody to the Lord in your heart."
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.840]   And you got this same Paul, "Bless his heart." I just love this guy.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.740]   Midnight, feet in stalks, having been beaten with many blows,
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.620]   and he and Silas are singing. They're singing hymns to God,
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:25.320]   which means he knew some hymns by heart, and singing was so much a part of Paul's life.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:32.560]   You don't usually think of Paul as a singer, but as a logician who pounds out Romans on an anvil of truth.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:39.500]   But no, no, no, no, no. He sang in tongues, and he sang intelligible language, and he sang in prison.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:46.440]   He probably sang on the road and sang in the boats and sang while he was clinging to the shards of wood in the sea.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:52.480]   This man was a singer big time. And where did he get that?
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.320]   Jesus sang. He sang Mark 14, 26.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.760]   "When they had sung a hymn, he and his apostles, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.060]   The last thing he does with his disciples almost is sing with them.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.940]   And of course, the New Testament loved the Psalms, and the songs are full of commands to sing over and over.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.240]   Five times, I think, it says, "Sing a new song."
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:25.680]   And Jesus says that his new covenant scribes, the writers, are going to be like a master of a house
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.960]   who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.120]   So I expect we will always be singing new songs and old songs.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:41.840]   I don't know if the word "trendy" is helpful. I think "new" is great. I hope we will anyway.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.600]   So it doesn't seem at all surprising to me that over the centuries,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:53.240]   Christians would come together to corporately express the infinite value of God
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.820]   by lifting their voices and lifting their hearts in song about his worth.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:05.120]   And that they would crave to hear the voice of God heralded from his word.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.820]   And of course, good night.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.200]   Lots more could be said about why we do what we do in worship,
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:21.400]   but that's pretty much why I feel so at home today in worship services like this,
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:31.640]   providedâ€”this is a huge provisionâ€”provided the preaching and the singing are radically God-centered,
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:39.480]   Christ-exalting, Gospel-rich, Bible-saturated, and singable and authentic through and through.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.260]   Amen. May that ever be more true of our churches in more and more ways.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.060]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Jeremy.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:50.320]   If you have a question that you just can't quite figure out, some issue that's confusing you,

[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:09.840]   Well, can a difficult marriage with lots of tension bring glory to Christ?
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.180]   Or is it only happy marriages that can do this?
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.360]   It's a great question, and it's next on the docket for Monday.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.260]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.900]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast, and have a wonderful weekend.
