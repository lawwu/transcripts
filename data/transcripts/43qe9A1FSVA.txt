[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - So, as I mentioned in my intro there,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.560]   we're gonna start with a bit of a discussion
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.460]   about kind of the commercial side of generative AI.
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.080]   All three of you are at companies
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.640]   where there is a very obvious kind of commercial component
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.920]   of this that is perhaps a lot more immediate
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.760]   than it is for some folks in the audience.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.760]   So, Dan, maybe let's start with you.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.880]   You know, Adobe moved quickly
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.560]   to launch its generative AI tool, Firefly.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.440]   Talk to me about the scale
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.360]   of the business opportunity here for Adobe.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.800]   And, you know, how much is this an opportunity
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.640]   for Adobe to drive additional revenue
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.200]   versus an expectation of your customers
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.160]   that there will be generative AI plugins
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.560]   to what Adobe offers?
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.080]   - Yeah, and I appreciate the question
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.400]   and the reference to Firefly.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.120]   It's not even one year old.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.440]   I think later this month it turns one.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.080]   But I think the opportunity is massive.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.760]   As you think about the three areas
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.760]   we as a company are focused on,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.080]   unleashing creativity for all,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.640]   accelerating document productivity,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.340]   empowering digital businesses,
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.320]   all three are gonna see a significant,
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.680]   meaningful tailwind as a result
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.840]   of this technology inflection.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.080]   And let me just take a step back
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.560]   and share a little bit of why
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.680]   I have so much conviction in it.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.080]   As you look at major and technology inflections
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.840]   as they shape end markets,
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.080]   innovation goes up, economic growth goes up.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.720]   Adobe's got a 40-year track record
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.800]   of being a key catalyst to many of the trends
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.160]   that shape the digital economy.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.060]   And there's a difference between capitalizing on a trend
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.180]   and shaping, being a key catalyst of that trend.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.340]   We've got a long track record of doing it.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.780]   This inflection's gonna be no different.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.160]   And as I think about the AI stack,
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.060]   there's data, there's models,
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.520]   and then there's the products and workflows
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.060]   that bring these technologies to life.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.520]   The third of the three is the most relevant importance.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.440]   That's where the magic happens with these technologies
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.240]   because it's only in the context
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.220]   of those products and workflows
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.800]   that this technology leads to real productivity enhancement.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.180]   And so we're incredibly bullish about this technology
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.180]   and we fully intend to be a key catalyst
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.820]   in shaping our end markets
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.980]   and driving success for our customers.
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.040]   - So one of the questions for,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.740]   I imagine for all three of you on this panel,
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.420]   but then we're gonna stay with you on this for a moment,
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.480]   is sort of like how to commercialize this work.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.500]   If the layer that you're thinking about is like,
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.400]   what are the products that sit below the data
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.640]   in the language model,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.120]   how do you kind of commercialize those?
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.680]   Adobe has these kind of generative AI credits
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.200]   that it's launched.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.360]   So talk to me a little bit about how you kind of arrived
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.880]   at that as a decision.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.760]   I think this is in the context of a lot of companies
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.360]   kind of scrutinizing how much they spend
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.120]   on software and services and so on.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.640]   And so the commercialization piece I think is fascinating
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.340]   and pitching it at the right level.
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.340]   - Yeah, what's great about the way we're positioned
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.600]   is we get to help our customers with both top line growth
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.640]   and bottom line productivity.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.700]   So there's a uniqueness of how we engage with our customers
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.340]   that leads to that simultaneous benefit,
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.800]   which we really like.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   Generative credits is one of a number of vectors
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.300]   that we're driving from a commercialization standpoint.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.320]   As you think about the accessibility of our tools
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.280]   and products, making them more approachable and accessible.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.140]   And as we think about customers engaging
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.640]   with the technology, time to success,
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   how quickly they can be productive
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.920]   is an important component of long-term retention.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.520]   So more people top of funnel
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.120]   through more accessible technology,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.960]   deeper level of engagement leading to better retention.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.460]   And then as we engage with custom models,
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.520]   adding more value to the relationships we already have.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.880]   Generative credits is one of a number of vectors
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.840]   that are available to the company.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.480]   And as we think about deep power users
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.920]   of our products and our technology,
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.560]   when you tokenize engagement,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.960]   turn a text into an image or a video or audio,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.080]   those power users are consuming the technology
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.720]   at a differential rate.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.060]   This allows them, based on that enhanced productivity,
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.100]   to make sure that the value that they realize
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.940]   is commensurate with the economics.
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.260]   And so there's a usage-based consumption model
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.560]   that sits alongside the subscription
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.740]   that's tailored to the power users
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.460]   that gets tapped into as they derive value
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.740]   from the technology.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.900]   - Got it, okay.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.700]   So Junior, I'd love to bring you in.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.340]   ServiceNow launched its generative AI offering,
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.120]   I think in September, is that right?
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.940]   - Yeah. - That's right.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.340]   - So you just reported on kind of the first quarter
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.180]   since it launched.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.540]   So let's just start with kind of what is it
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.460]   and what has the uptake been since it launched?
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.320]   - Yeah, so we've been actually,
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.660]   ServiceNow's been investing in AI for years and years.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.940]   We actually had our first AI SKUs launched back in 2018.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.900]   That was more predictive AI.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.460]   And we saw pretty great uptick,
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.040]   both on pricing as well as penetration in our user base.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.420]   So fast forward to September, we launched NowAssist,
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.700]   which is our generative AI SKUs.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.540]   We launched them on September 30th,
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.260]   so one day left of the quarter.
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.060]   And we actually had several multi-million dollar deals
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.140]   just in that one day.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.460]   Q4 was the first full quarter of the launch.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.940]   And it was by far our best performing
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.380]   new product launch ever to date.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.080]   And so the opportunity is vast.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.560]   And it's all about really driving value for customers.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.460]   What we've done is we've infused
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.460]   human-like conversational interfaces throughout the platform
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.140]   and it's about getting the users,
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.160]   whether they're employees or customers,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.920]   the information they need much faster
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.180]   and more reliably and more accurate.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.140]   And then it's about getting developers more productive.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.080]   And so we're seeing an uptick across the board,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.460]   across the platform portfolio.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.140]   And I think Gartner estimates that
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.800]   three trillion is gonna be spent on AI in the next,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.280]   until 2027, with a third of that going to generative AI.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.120]   So the opportunity is here and it's now.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.540]   And we're seeing lots of interest
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.640]   from customers across the board.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.080]   And it's always about value add, right?
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.920]   And so how are customers gonna get to value more quickly?
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.400]   When we think about that,
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   we try to leverage 10% of the value internally in pricing
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.720]   and give 90% of the value to customers.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.540]   And so those conversations are extremely powerful
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.540]   and there's not one CFO or CEO that I talk to
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.900]   that is not really leaning in
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.040]   to what gen AI can do for their business
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.060]   because they believe, and I completely agree with them,
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.900]   that it's not only a productivity win
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.500]   and a cost savings win for them,
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.860]   but it's business model innovation, it's top-line growth.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.380]   And so we're really excited
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.380]   about the use cases for ServiceNow.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.820]   - How do you differentiate what ServiceNow offers?
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.980]   All of your peers are coming out with generative AI offering
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.380]   and I'm sure everyone in this room gets pitched
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.500]   something generative AI related, frankly, all the time,
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.820]   probably twice on Sundays.
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.180]   So how do you differentiate it and say,
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.220]   ours is the real deal?
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.940]   - Well, our strategy right now I think is unique
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.740]   in that we are focused on domain-specific
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.780]   large language models
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.580]   within the ServiceNow platform already.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.100]   So it's customers or new customers
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.820]   that have already worked with the platform,
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.980]   understand the platform.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.740]   And so if you're working on ServiceNow
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.060]   to have that incremental capability
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.180]   and that incremental value add,
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.140]   if you think about it, it's like what CFO is gonna say,
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.260]   I don't want AI, I just want that standard SKU.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.660]   No, they want the power
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.660]   and it's within the ServiceNow platform.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.980]   So all the great workflows,
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.420]   all the great abilities to scale your operations,
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.740]   it's already there and it's already in the business.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.980]   And so other companies are doing the same
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.140]   within their platforms to supercharge.
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.780]   Back to your question initially,
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.780]   how much is us leaning in and believing in the top line
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.940]   or customers pulling for it?
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.740]   It's both, like customers are going to,
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.980]   if they're not asking for it already,
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.820]   they will be very, very quickly.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.100]   So those companies and those platforms
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.300]   that are building it in
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.020]   have got to really pick up pace and do it faster.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.820]   Okay, so Anne-Marie, I'd like to bring you in.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.420]   Tell me a little bit about how Airtable
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.060]   is thinking about this from a commercial standpoint
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.300]   and then we'll move the conversation on
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.420]   to sort of generative AI for the internal finance function.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.420]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.620]   So we're really excited about how to leverage GenAI
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.460]   within our existing platforms.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.220]   We're a low-code platform.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.780]   We already work with 80% of Fortune 100 companies
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.860]   to enable their knowledge workers, citizen developers,
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.980]   to create apps for their day-to-day work
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.060]   and their workflows.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.140]   It's a really natural point to insert generative AI,
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.020]   which is very use case specific,
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.540]   integrated into the data and the workflow
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.020]   that already exists.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.100]   And so it's basically making things faster,
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.580]   making things easier,
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.660]   allowing GenAI to use the context of all the data
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.940]   more so than a human can.
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.780]   And we're thinking of it as,
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.780]   the big kind of functional use cases for us
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.780]   are marketing, product, sales, operations.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.380]   And so we think of Airtable as sort of the co-pilot
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.740]   for all those operations,
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.180]   just like our engineering teams are using GitHub co-pilot
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.740]   and developers are probably the first
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.140]   in really getting efficiencies on GenAI,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.660]   but we see that happening across these other functions.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.220]   And I can give you sort of like a internal
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.340]   and customer example of how that comes to life
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.940]   and our digital product team, as you can imagine,
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.220]   is most excited about this.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.500]   And they've been ingesting all of our customer feedback
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.300]   using GenAI, which means reams of data from Salesforce,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.340]   from Gong, from web.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.860]   GenAI then categorizes it by topic,
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.660]   sentiment ranks it sort of minus five to plus five,
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.220]   puts it in prioritization of what will make
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.620]   the biggest impact for customers,
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.780]   literally sort of responds with its own ideas
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.460]   of what product could we create to answer that feedback.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.540]   How would we describe it?
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.740]   What would we name it?
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.540]   Now, as you can imagine, it's really important
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.340]   to have humans in the loop
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.700]   on this sort of workflow automation.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.540]   And so we believe strongly in like human creativity
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.180]   and judgment, it has to be there.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.580]   And then GenAI can be there for enhancing scale
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.940]   and just sort of machine scale context gathering.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.980]   And then our product team literally then attaches that
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.340]   into the marketing workflow where they're generating
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:59.340]   messaging and ad copy emails that get better open rates
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.540]   and conversion.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.060]   So that's our internal enthusiasm on our dogfooding.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.620]   Externally, we have one of our really large cloud customers.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.980]   They already use us for campaign management
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.300]   on the marketing side.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:16.300]   They're now using our GenAI pilot to generate ad copy,
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.940]   depending on what the creative brief is,
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.580]   what past performance is.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.260]   They're finding existing marketing assets
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.980]   that otherwise wouldn't have been tagged
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.820]   to this specific initiative.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.940]   So it reduces content waste.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.340]   And so I sort of have been thinking of it
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.220]   as this really exciting, like win, win, win, win.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.180]   You save time, you save cost, you improve revenues
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.700]   by faster speed to market, better conversion.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.420]   And then really powerfully,
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.060]   our employees just seem happier
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.140]   'cause you're taking away the tedious tasks
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.380]   and the manual tasks, giving them more powerful content.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.020]   And then their creativity and judgment
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.260]   is still the primary focus.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.020]   And I think it improves retention and satisfaction.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.900]   And for engineering teams, that's a really big deal
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.300]   as a CFO to see engineers happy as a software company.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.780]   - Sure. - It's been really exciting.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.860]   - Sure, so we'll come back to the human in the loop piece
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.700]   'cause I do want to kind of discuss that
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.620]   in a bit more detail.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.300]   But first, I'd like to focus a little bit
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.340]   on sort of generative AI
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.060]   for the finance function specifically.
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.620]   And so Gina, I'd like to start with you.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.740]   You told me on our prep call last week
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.580]   that you're especially excited about using generative AI
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.340]   for sort of revenue recognition.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.140]   That was one of the examples that we discussed.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.900]   So talk to me a little bit about that.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.980]   Is that something that you're currently piloting?
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.380]   And if so, what have the results been so far?
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.380]   - Yeah, so I think there's numerous use cases within finance
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.820]   and we're piloting a whole bunch of them.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.260]   We had a hackathon and we picked like the top 10 areas
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.540]   that we want to focus and we're going with them first,
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.700]   but we have a list of use cases.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.180]   P&A is a big area, automated forecasting.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.460]   How do you forecast like a top line
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.060]   or a bottoms up and what's better?
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.380]   So we're doing a ton of that.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.340]   But the revenue recognition piece is super interesting.
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.740]   If you think about it,
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.980]   it's all based on complex contract terms, right?
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.180]   And so the sales organizations ping finance
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.900]   between 3,000 and five times a quarter
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.700]   on just trying to understand the best way
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.100]   to formulate the contract to get the right rev rec.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.180]   And how do we use Gen AI to automatically answer?
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.540]   So many of them are similar questions
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.100]   and how do we automate that?
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.620]   And by the way, not only is it automation time
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.820]   from a finance perspective,
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.740]   but then my sales teams are spending less time
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.340]   figuring out how to draft the contract
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.380]   and spending much more time with customers.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.980]   So I think it's not only a productivity perspective,
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.340]   but also how do I get my sales people
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.700]   spending more time with customers?
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.260]   It's gonna be a much better customer engagement.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.060]   And so twofold is an area.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.180]   We've been piloting it and it's going extremely well.
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.580]   The finance teams love it because again,
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.940]   to Amberine's point,
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.740]   it's about automating the rotes and the routine
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.260]   and really giving time back
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.980]   for much more complex, interesting work.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.220]   And we're having lots of engagement across the board
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.740]   from our finance teams and really leaning in
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.740]   to how Gen AI is gonna simplify what they do every day.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.180]   And they're so excited about it.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.460]   - And are there any concerns about sort of the accuracy,
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.260]   the accuracy of a use case like that?
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.300]   Let's say whatever model you're using is 95% accurate.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.860]   We talked about having a human in the loop,
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.420]   but what has the pilot revealed in that regard?
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.500]   And what kind of safeguards have you put in place
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.940]   to make sure you're capturing that 5% of concern?
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.620]   - Well, I think the point is that the human interface
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.940]   is super important, right?
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.660]   There's always gonna be a check on the backend
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.500]   as to does this contract term meet what it needs?
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.860]   And so there's going to be that review,
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.180]   but it's that interaction,
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.740]   that back and forth email exchange.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.180]   Do you understand getting on the phone?
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.300]   Do you understand that?
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.900]   That's able to really be automated.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.260]   So you're 100% right.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.620]   Accuracy is really important,
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.620]   but that human interface and interaction
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.140]   is extremely important.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.740]   And by the way, CFOs,
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.780]   I don't know if you've gotten the rep
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.860]   in your rep letters yet.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.820]   A lot of the big four accounting firms are repping,
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.940]   asking you to rep to make sure that if you're using AI,
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.100]   that there's that backend kind of closed loop around it.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.820]   So really important, it's a great point,
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.140]   but it's not to say that we shouldn't be afraid
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.140]   of using AI because of that.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.420]   You just need to manage around it,
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:33.420]   just like we've managed around other technology evolutions
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.620]   in the years that we've been CFOs.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.780]   - Sure.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.060]   Dan, similarly, you held a kind of a finance team hackathon,
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.340]   which I think you said you generated about 100 ideas
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.660]   of sort of specific use cases.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.500]   As I understand it,
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.820]   you're moving forward with five pilots, is that right?
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.020]   So I'd like to focus on one today,
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.660]   which was, you've called it kind of the forecasting engine.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.500]   So I think this touches a little bit on Gina's point
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.860]   about sort of FP&A and so on.
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.020]   So tell me again, how will this work?
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.020]   And ultimately, what is the sort of end goal
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.220]   that you think is attainable
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.220]   and how far away are you from reaching that?
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.300]   - Yeah, and before I go into the detail,
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.700]   just about the hackathon, Gina was talking about it,
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.580]   I was talking about it.
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.660]   We were commenting backstage on the enthusiasm
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.900]   that we see in our organizations
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.420]   around this technology inflection.
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.820]   Part of transformation is about change management
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.860]   and they're inextricably linked.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.860]   How do you build that groundswell of enthusiasm
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.380]   within the organizations
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.420]   to lean into this technology inflection?
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.100]   You bring them into the process
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.580]   and you help them architect the solution
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.900]   and the way of working.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.820]   So a hackathon is a really great way
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.700]   to build that groundswell.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.020]   Yeah, we had over 100 submissions.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.300]   We boiled it down to 20.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.500]   Five of them were prioritized,
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.900]   but now we have a living, breathing pipeline
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.980]   of future opportunities
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.020]   that we're gonna continue to focus on.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.900]   So one of them is a forecasting engine.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.540]   So like most companies,
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.220]   the annual planning process is a heavy lift
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.460]   inside of the company
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.540]   and we are in the process of pivoting
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.460]   to a more fluid environment,
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.860]   a rolling forecast environment.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.940]   But the way we communicate with investors in the street,
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.460]   that annual process is gonna be a thing.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.460]   Now the question is,
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.940]   is how do you pivot to a rolling forecast
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.940]   and still maintain discipline from an annual standpoint?
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.860]   You communicate with investors.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.860]   When you synthesize all of the data
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.980]   that sits inside of the company,
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.860]   you weigh it appropriately,
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.060]   you backtest it to make sure that the model
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.860]   and the algorithm that you tune
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.100]   accurately reflects the performance of the company,
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.300]   you can get to a rough cut annual plan
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.980]   very, very quickly.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.460]   I mean, this is a month and a half process
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.060]   that you can start to access
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.700]   a first rough cut approximation within minutes.
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.740]   We're early in the process.
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.140]   We did a, let's see what this spits out
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.940]   from a prior year
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.580]   and it was probably 85, 90%
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.300]   of what the teams ground through
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.420]   and it was done within minutes.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.180]   So it's a really powerful tool
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.980]   to sit alongside the planning process
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.220]   and the value in my view of a financial organization
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.660]   isn't about rolling up numbers.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.180]   That's obviously important.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.940]   Integrity of the numbers is super important
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.820]   but when do you see a signal
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.180]   and what's the insight from that signal?
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:39.740]   When do you take action based on that insight
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.660]   and how long does it take you to drive impact?
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.900]   There is a speed of execution
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.220]   that comes with this technology
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.340]   because the time to signal and time to insight
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.220]   is gonna get sped up dramatically
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.660]   and then we take the great people
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.540]   that call our company home
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.180]   and turn them on to an action-oriented,
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.540]   solution-oriented mindset to solve business problems
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.380]   and having that forecasting engine
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.340]   sit alongside an annual planning process
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.260]   is an important aspect of focusing on
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.740]   if we do nothing, this is the likely outcome.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.420]   Now, what are the do different leads
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.100]   to get a different outcome?
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.820]   You transition to solution space very quickly
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.540]   and it's not just an annual planning process.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.220]   We've got these predictive engines
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.180]   running alongside intra-quarter performance
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.780]   and it's fluid.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.660]   I get input from the sales team
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.420]   on what they think they're gonna do
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.980]   and I've got my predictive engine
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.180]   and it's like, well, we disagree on that
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.380]   and we disagree on that
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.580]   and what actions are we gonna take
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.740]   to shape the outcome,
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.900]   to get where we need to be for the quarter
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.980]   and then we take a look at it at the end of the quarter
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.780]   and the accuracy embedded in this,
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.260]   if it's done well, is pretty impressive.
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.780]   - How does that change your,
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.540]   the skillset required of you as the CFO?
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.420]   If you have this information,
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.740]   how does that change the way that you then
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.020]   pass that information out to the rest of the C-suite,
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.420]   the rest of the company,
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.580]   use that to potentially influence decision-making
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.420]   and so on?
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.940]   Essentially, is this a kind of a powerful
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.340]   new decision-making tool that you have,
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.060]   you're the kind of C-suite owner of
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.100]   and so how do you cascade that out?
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.660]   I guess that's a question for all three of you, honestly,
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.100]   but let's start with you, Dan.
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.420]   - Yeah, so from my point of view,
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.020]   everybody's gonna have their own philosophy
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.900]   on how to do this role and do it well.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.500]   From my perspective,
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.020]   I think the role of finance CFO,
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.260]   sort through complexity,
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.780]   get the core underlying root cause drivers,
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.940]   frame the debate and dialogue,
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.900]   frame the decision-making process,
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.020]   sharpen business decision-making
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.260]   and once decisions are made,
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.180]   go drive execution and drive impact inside of the company.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.860]   And so this is a key tool that gets us, again,
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.140]   to that signal and insights faster.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.260]   But there's a democratization of data.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.260]   I don't think this sits in a finance silo.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.900]   It's how you permeate this information
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.820]   to help shape that discussion,
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.980]   real-time business discussion inside of the company
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.620]   to get to better business decisions
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.860]   and better business outcomes.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.860]   It's pervasive.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.340]   - I would just add that the role of the CFO
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.260]   has been evolving for years now, right?
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.700]   And this is just one area in addition.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.540]   So the point that Dan was making,
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.580]   it's not about just having a forecast number quicker,
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.980]   which is super powerful.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.500]   It's what you then do with the time that you have,
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.980]   that information earlier.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.580]   You know, I talk about culture of finance.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.540]   I want the finance organization
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.820]   to be the first call of the business.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.220]   It's not just about compiling the data
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.580]   and reporting out on it.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.220]   It's about really driving impact and driving,
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.420]   okay, here's that signal.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.740]   This is what we need to be doing.
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.020]   And by the way, we've been doing this for a while now, right?
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.980]   So we have, Dan, early insights into a quarter.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.820]   So if things in certain areas
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.460]   look like that they're not shaping up the way we thought,
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.660]   get in there early.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.700]   And it's not just about telling the salesperson
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.180]   or telling the marketing person.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.980]   It's about working with them jointly to go solve it,
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.060]   thinking really throughly,
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.980]   thinking strategically about
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.900]   what this information is able to drive.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.460]   And so I think the role is completely evolving.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.100]   And we are probably the only person in the C-suite,
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.580]   besides the CEO,
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.580]   who has that bird's eye vantage across the enterprise
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:35.580]   that can really help drive impact in any area.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.820]   And so, you know, oftentimes back in the day,
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.620]   I'd get my hands slapped to say,
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.220]   that's not finance, right?
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.060]   That's not finance.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.220]   This is mine.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.380]   Now, they're like, Gina, bring it, right?
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.620]   They're like, they want you involved
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.940]   'cause they know that you have the information
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.140]   that's gonna help them solve their problems
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.380]   and get to the better results.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.820]   And so that role has been evolving for a while.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.540]   And Gen AI is only gonna continue that evolution.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.900]   - Sure, and Marie?
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.420]   - Yeah, exactly what Gina said.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.020]   I mean, we are in such a privileged position
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.980]   where we see absolutely everything.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.860]   And I think that gives a lot of power,
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.660]   also a lot of responsibility.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.260]   What I also think is super helpful
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.620]   is every one of my colleagues knows
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.940]   that I have relatively the most pure intentions
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.580]   of doing the best thing for the business
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.460]   and always thinking about the business and the customers.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.620]   And so while different functional groups,
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.140]   depending on the quarter, depending on the year,
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.180]   have different priorities
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.180]   where they're very focused on one thing, as finance,
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.940]   we're focused on the kind of long-term success
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.500]   of the business as a whole.
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.660]   And I think that just adds to the power of the voice,
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.100]   to the direction we give.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.380]   And then in terms of your earlier question
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.540]   of use cases within finance,
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.500]   we have a lot of parallel experiences,
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.540]   revenue recognition, forecasting.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.260]   I'd say one of my teams,
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.140]   which has become a bit of a hero and usually isn't,
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.740]   is our accounts receivable team
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.900]   because we've been able to use Gen AI
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.420]   in a lot of different ways for them.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.540]   So content generation in terms of emails and follow-ups,
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.660]   chat in terms of interfaces with salespeople and customers,
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.540]   as well as just forecasting on cash collection times,
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.820]   prioritizing the risk of customers.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.220]   And they've been really excited
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.820]   and it's just been nice to see a team
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.820]   that usually doesn't see the limelight
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.100]   pop up through this technology.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:21.940]   - Couldn't agree more.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.780]   It's nice to hear that our use cases are very aligned.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.700]   - Yeah, I would say, just on your point, Amber,
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.060]   we had a CIO network summit a couple of weeks ago
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.580]   and the CIO of Cisco was on one of the panels
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.580]   and he shared a similar anecdote to yours,
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.940]   but from an HR context where he said
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.900]   the response to recruitment emails that they send out
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.380]   is significantly higher when they're generated
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.100]   by a generative AI tool as opposed to by a human
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.780]   because it sounds counterintuitive,
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.340]   but it's more personalized using the generative AI tool.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.740]   - It's not cut and paste, right?
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.740]   But I'm curious, for this panel,
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.300]   with some of these use cases that we're talking about
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.580]   with finance specifically,
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:04.740]   right now, generative AI is quite expensive,
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.020]   whether it's the commercialization of the models,
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.180]   the licensing, enterprise license for the model itself,
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.660]   whether it's the data that is required to be fed into that,
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.020]   whether it's the human time required on the front end
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.740]   to get these things up and running.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.220]   So how are you thinking about the cost
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.100]   of some of these use cases that you're thinking about
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.660]   internally and how long they'll take to pay off?
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.340]   The value of what you've just described
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.660]   is clearly transformational in theory.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.700]   Are you there yet?
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.700]   And how do you weigh cost versus return?
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.180]   - I'll start there because I think
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.940]   it's a really important conversation.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.660]   A lot of CFOs are all about ROI
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.060]   and it's super important, right?
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.900]   And it's about how quickly am I gonna get the productivity
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.500]   and what does it mean for cost savings?
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.580]   I think this is a whole different ballgame.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.900]   And I think you've got to invest upfront
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.980]   because if you don't, you're gonna be left behind.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.140]   And how I think about it,
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.820]   and it's really hard to kind of pinpoint attrition,
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.340]   for example, but we go back
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.860]   to the employee engagement perspective,
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.180]   and this is not just in finance.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.900]   This is across the board in the organization.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.180]   But when employees are doing more creative,
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.700]   more impactful work, they're much more engaged,
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.660]   which means attrition is lower and you get to,
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.060]   which is expensive from a cost perspective.
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.180]   But even more importantly than the cost,
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.940]   it's keeping that brain trust internal and inside.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.860]   That is invaluable.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.420]   So you've gotta be able to take the numbers,
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.060]   but also take the opportunity cost of not doing it
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.540]   into account when you're really thinking ROI.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.220]   And that's across the board, whether it's a finance
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.100]   or whether I'm selling to a customer
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.340]   when I'm talking to customers.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.580]   It's about the value add and the productivity,
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.660]   but it's also about what happens if I don't invest today?
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.780]   One of the first acquisitions I greenlit
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.740]   when I joined in 2020 was a company called Element AI.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.700]   And it was about hiring talent in the AI space
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.700]   that didn't really have great ROI in the initial years.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:12.020]   But at the end of the day, infusing AI into the platform
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.900]   was gonna be more and more important as we went on.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.660]   And so we greenlit it, and it's one of the reasons
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.260]   why we were able to be first to market
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.020]   with actual Gen AI product in market.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:27.020]   And so as CFOs, you need to be a little bit more open today
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.980]   I think than maybe in times past
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.540]   of really investing in front of the curve.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.460]   You need to be smart.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.500]   It's about taking balance risks
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.620]   and saying yes to a few things potentially,
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.140]   but really making sure that you're not just hamstrung
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.500]   by the numbers only.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.540]   Because I think in this day and age,
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.180]   not investing is really gonna put you in trouble
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.420]   for the mid and long-term.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.340]   - Anne-Marie?
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.460]   - Yeah, so you mentioned this earlier, Ben.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.060]   Over the course of the last few years,
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.700]   we had a lot of tool sprawl
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.140]   and way too much technology spend.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.020]   So we have a tech council, and they see their role
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.380]   as primarily figuring out how to consolidate tools
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.620]   and reduce spend.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.860]   We didn't wanna put AI into that council
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.260]   because the mandate of that council
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.820]   is very focused on cost savings.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.500]   And so we created a separate AI council,
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.460]   which is kind of mandated to go find
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.260]   the most interesting value-added use cases
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.860]   and sort of on the four wins philosophy.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.980]   We want use cases where we get all four of those things,
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.940]   like time-saving, cost-saving, revenue improvement,
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.260]   morale, inspiration for the employees.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.700]   And that AI council is looking at the world differently
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.780]   and surfacing different use cases.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.020]   And I review those every kind of week or two weeks.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.540]   And I'll often come in and be like,
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.860]   "Why did we say no to this?"
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:45.700]   And the answer will be like,
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.900]   "We weren't sure about the cost versus value."
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.460]   And then we'll talk through,
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.020]   "Are we underestimating the value
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.260]   "to make sure that we push on that use case?"
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.140]   I think when it comes to commercialization
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.820]   as buyers of software, we're seeing,
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.020]   there's a lot of evolution.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.180]   Like we're seeing some vendors price at zero,
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.380]   others price at like 80% of their base product.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.180]   And I think everyone's trying to figure out
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.300]   exactly where the value equation shakes out.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.580]   What will the take rate be at different pricing?
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.220]   So I think there's a lot to be learned
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.780]   about the evolution of what will this cost us over time.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.620]   - Got it.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.460]   - It's an interesting point though,
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.500]   what you bring up.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.420]   And we're hearing this a lot because we get the question,
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.140]   I'm sure you do Jen as well,
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:32.140]   of how are IT budgets being allocated
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.780]   to Gen AI versus the other pieces?
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.260]   And while you're right,
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.820]   they're definitely focused on cost takeout
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.700]   because of the application proliferation that we've seen.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.300]   It's one of the reasons why you're seeing
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.300]   a lot more platform consolidation.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.540]   Like instead of having best point solutions
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.420]   in different areas, which by the way is very costly
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.100]   and from a security perspective, a nightmare,
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.860]   to platform consolidation,
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.860]   which really enables, I think,
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:04.860]   an interesting way of how CIOs are thinking
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.300]   about their budgets and spend.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.900]   It's like you're being mindful of costs here,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.620]   but taking some of that savings
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.660]   and allocating it to the Gen AI
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.100]   and the modernization and the IT of the future.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.740]   And I think that's what we're seeing
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.340]   when we're talking to customers.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.300]   I don't know, Dan, if you're seeing the same.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.460]   - Yeah, 100%.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.980]   I agree with everything Gina and Amberine just said,
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.980]   and I'll augment it, build on it with two comments.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.020]   Change is coming.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.980]   We have a choice.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.260]   We can lead or we can follow.
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.780]   We can lead or it can be imposed upon us.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.900]   I know where I am on that equation,
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.580]   but change is coming.
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:51.580]   Second thing, not everything that can be counted counts
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:55.860]   and not everything that counts can be counted.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.380]   And so this is one of those periods of time
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.300]   where we're gonna have to put on our comfort hat
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:07.300]   with ambiguity and be smart about the choices we make.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:13.460]   Prioritize, focus on business impact, super important.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:19.860]   - And be able to pivot, and be able to pivot.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.380]   If something you made a bet on is not coming to fruition,
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.060]   pivot fast and go to the next one.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.500]   - We're going to open up to audience questions.
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.700]   I think we'll have time for one audience question.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.460]   If anyone has one, get your thinking caps on.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.780]   But I guess my follow-up question
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.020]   from what you're just describing is like,
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.620]   how do you make sure that you don't over-commit?
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.500]   How do you make sure that in a year, two years time,
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.900]   you don't turn around and go,
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.900]   that really was quite expensive.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.740]   Yeah, any thoughts on that?
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:51.060]   You're all very enthusiastic about this,
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.700]   but there must be a ceiling.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.460]   - Yeah, so and I mean it in all sincerity.
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.500]   We see it on our product teams.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.260]   Hyper-focused from a prioritization standpoint
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.300]   on what really is going to move the needle.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.580]   That's the external facing aspects of our roadmap.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.540]   The stuff is going to be expensive to invest in.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:16.500]   There's going to be a dynamic where that line is drawn.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.700]   What is below the line today
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.820]   may have been above the line yesterday.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.260]   Be focused and prioritize.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.060]   We can't do 100 things well.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.580]   We're doing five, we're taking a journey.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.980]   We're going to learn a lot in this process.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.460]   The five that we're initially doing
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.140]   are solving real business impacts.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.460]   You see the pull through from the business,
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.020]   our business partners,
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.780]   and we're not getting out over our skis.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.420]   We are moving fast and we're being aggressive,
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.820]   but we're not getting out over our skis.
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.540]   And eventually you're going to develop this flywheel
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.020]   inside of the company where you can do more and more
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.220]   and develop momentum,
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.020]   but it's going to be based on proof points
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.100]   and real experience
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.540]   as opposed to discussions and conversations.
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.460]   - The only thing I'd add to that just very quickly
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.740]   is prioritization 100%.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.260]   As CFOs, I think we have a really important seat
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.860]   at the table to help the company prioritize.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.380]   Because again, we see cross-enterprise.
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.420]   The things that are going to be most impactful
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.780]   are on the list first,
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.380]   and you just keep plowing down the list.
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.860]   But we have that responsibility
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.260]   to help the company prioritize.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.060]   Otherwise, because everyone's pulling.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.380]   Everyone wants AI, marketing, finance, legal.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.700]   How do we really focus on what's the most meaningful?
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.540]   I think CFOs have a real role to play there.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.060]   - Yeah, and to build on that point,
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.860]   we have internally our North Star is
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.020]   anything that helps our own product development on AI
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.620]   gets priority.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.740]   And so we haven't introduced our officials Q yet,
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.420]   but we already had sales in Q4
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.340]   because customers were asking for it.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.500]   So any investment we make into our teams
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.940]   and developing our own product helps our customers,
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.820]   helps the business.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.500]   So we'll prioritize that
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.980]   over some of the internal efficiency maybe,
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.180]   and then iterate and learn and make sure,
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.060]   like we're not gonna wait for three years
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:04.900]   to see what happened.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.500]   Like every quarter we'll be iterating and pivoting.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.340]   - Got it, okay.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.100]   Do we have any questions from the audience?
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.380]   If so, raise your hand.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.740]   Okay, thank you.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.500]   Oh, yes, we have one here.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.780]   Microphone is just making its way towards you.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.300]   If you could just state your name and company, please.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.140]   - Great insights.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.140]   Thank you for the discussion.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.060]   My name is Guru Ramamurthy, I'm from Bayer.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.420]   Some of you mentioned earlier on in the conversation
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.500]   about not just this being a cost and productivity game,
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.100]   but also revenue.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.700]   When you look at your clients
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.020]   and the products you're offering,
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.740]   how does it actually translate into revenue?
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.380]   Because from where I sit,
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.380]   this feels and sits more like a cost
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.580]   and productivity savings initiative,
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.620]   albeit in a supercharged environment.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.140]   Can you articulate a little bit on the revenue side, please?
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.180]   - I'll give one.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.820]   So we announced a partnership with Visa just last quarter.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.140]   And what Visa is partnering with us on, with Gen AI,
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.780]   is all about building a solution to automate disputes
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.740]   for all the banks that issue Visa cards, for example.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.340]   And so the ability for them to monetize that solution
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.060]   is real, and not only will that generate revenue for them,
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.140]   from a disputes perspective,
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.580]   the savings on just being able to resolve
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.260]   or identify issues much earlier in the process is huge.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.180]   Billions is what they're talking about.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.820]   And so that's just one example of how Gen AI
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.020]   is going to help our customers,
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.980]   not only from the bottom line, but also from the top line.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.980]   - Yeah, and on the marketing side,
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.780]   we've already seen improvement
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.060]   in open rates on marketing messages,
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.580]   conversion rates on top of funnel.
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.740]   So that's one avenue.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.940]   Closer to your use case lately,
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.740]   we have a life sciences customer who's using Gen AI
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.820]   to collate research, comb through research faster,
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.460]   and they believe it'll get them to market faster
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.020]   in order to be able to do both faster drug discovery,
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.460]   as well as get drugs on the market faster.
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.300]   So I really do think we'll see
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.380]   true revenue evolution from this.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.180]   - There's a lot of interesting use cases for health.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.180]   - Yeah, I'll throw out another example.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.660]   IBM just came public with this statistic
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.780]   in the last 24, 48 hours.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.660]   They've standardized on our technology
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.500]   from a content production and distribution.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:38.080]   They're seeing 10x increase in productivity.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.820]   They're serving that content up to their customers 60% faster
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.700]   and the content that their customers get,
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.980]   they're engaging 26x.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.140]   A lot of it rests on those digital insights,
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:55.620]   being able to sort through the complexity
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.340]   of that customer data,
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.780]   productivity on the front end
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.260]   from a content creation standpoint,
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.680]   and activation and delivery,
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:09.680]   the insights that are fueling those types of statistics
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.180]   for a very large, complex company.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.380]   This stuff is real for those that are leaning into it
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.020]   and leaning in in the right way.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.620]   - We're over slightly by a minute or two,
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.940]   but Dan, I had a final closing question for you.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.220]   It's slightly unrelated to the topic of this session,
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.940]   but one of the themes that we're exploring at this event
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.420]   is the outlook for M&A.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.540]   It's obviously been a quiet period for M&A broadly.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.060]   Some of that has been due to concerns
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.060]   about antitrust activity.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.860]   Adobe recently sort of walked away
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.740]   from its planned acquisition of Figma.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.500]   What did you learn from the process
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.940]   and given the sort of antitrust environment,
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.900]   is Adobe still in a position to be opportunistic
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.460]   or are you planning on sort of
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.420]   wait and see mode for a little bit?
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.380]   - Well, the great thing is for all the reasons
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.020]   we've been up on stage talking about,
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.900]   we've got an enormous set of opportunities in front of us
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.700]   and we couldn't be more excited about what's in front of us.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.140]   When I take a step back philosophically
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.780]   about what it means to sit in seats like this,
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:12.620]   the CEO seat, we plan a decade out.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.140]   We think about what it's gonna take to win
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.020]   and win big in our core markets,
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.180]   to be a leader, to inflect those markets,
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.620]   to be pervasive in the way in which
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.620]   our customers get work done.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.900]   Regulatory environments ebb and flow.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.460]   Strategic decision-making of enterprises doesn't.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.860]   And so nothing changes as a result of an ebb and flow
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.340]   in the regulatory environment.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.220]   We're gonna do what we've always done,
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:48.780]   which is drive a strong, organic engine of innovation.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.620]   We'll complement it from time to time
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.380]   with inorganic activity,
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.020]   but we're gonna be thinking long-term
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.820]   what it takes our company to win.
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.700]   We find an opportunity, we're gonna go action it
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.940]   and we're not gonna try to be prognosticators
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.460]   of the ebb and flow of a regulatory environment.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:14.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
