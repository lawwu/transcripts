[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Hello everybody, it's Sam and Sydney from Financial Samurai and in this episode we want to talk about why early retirement or fire is becoming obsolete
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.380]   And also I wanted to get some perspective about early retirement from you Sydney from a female's perspective
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.540]   Hopefully you listened to our previous podcast episode where we talked about the greatest benefit of retiring early
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.920]   Which is greater happiness for longer and higher peak levels of happiness
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.940]   But I'm sure some of you might have listened or read the post and thought well gee that's nice
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.220]   Of course, I want to retire early and you know experience more happiness, but I can't well the good news
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.300]   The good news is you don't have to actually retire early or early to feel this happiness
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.260]   Since I kick-started the modern-day fire movement in 2009
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.820]   I've noticed many changes in the past
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.400]   The goal was to simply generate enough passive income to cover your living expenses, but that's hard
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.380]   It took me I would say what since 1999 to 2012
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.140]   Yeah 13 years to get to a basic level of financial independence
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.340]   And then another five years after that to earn enough to provide for a family and not stress too much
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.220]   however
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.900]   Since 2009 we've had new terms come up right barista fire is one of them
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.300]   I think it's a smart solution where you work like a part-time job to get health care benefits and supplemental income
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.820]   To help you in retirement
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.980]   I was thinking about going back to Hawaii and instead of working at Starbucks because I don't drink coffee to go to
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.500]   Coldstone Creamery, you know on the strip in Waikiki. I can eat all the ice cream
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.700]   I wanted maybe cake to probably not really healthy, but they provided health care insurance
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.700]   Which is huge for any retiree retiree and then a new term popped up called coast fire
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.100]   Coast fire emerged for those who are still working day jobs, but wanted to feel good about the amount of retirement savings
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.860]   They already had but it's just weird because coast fire is like, okay
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.500]   What's the difference between coast fire and a person working a job and then saving for retirement?
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.940]   It's kind of like well here. Here's a trophy your fire. I'm fire
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.620]   Everybody's fire
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:15.020]   Everybody gets a car like Oprah Winfrey said the reality is coast fire is an illusion just to help make you feel better
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.580]   About your progress but post pandemic I think early retirement and fire is becoming obsolete
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.820]   Simply because more and more people are able to work from home
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.100]   And when you get to work from home, you have way more flexibility
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.900]   And I know you know
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.100]   We live in San Francisco
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.620]   And there are a lot of tech jobs that enable people to work from home
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.400]   To play while they work from home run errands while they work from home
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.220]   send their kids and pick them up their kids up early because they're working from home and some people have
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.500]   Criticized this idea because not everybody can work from home and I totally understand that but you did some research Sydney and
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.660]   What did you find out just in a quick search?
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.580]   I found some studies that were highlighted on Forbes
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.180]   So roughly about 25% of jobs now in the US are being done remotely
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.420]   But there was a separate study that estimates that about
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:21.340]   40% could be done remotely. So there actually is still room for growth in that but that's gonna ultimately depend on each individual
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.860]   employers policies and
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:31.580]   The employees themselves ultimately some actually prefer to work in the office, but it just depends. There's a lot of variables
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.620]   Well, the point of that statistic is 25% are
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.380]   Working from home but up to 40% can work from home. So that is a becoming that is a trend line that we should foresee
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.900]   And which is why I'm saying
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.980]   Fire is becoming obsolete. I'm not saying it's obsolete right now
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.360]   Everybody wants to achieve financial independence no matter what job you're doing, but the trend is towards
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.020]   Obsolescence and here's the thing folks since I haven't had a traditional day job since 2012
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.680]   I've been experienced what real-time in real life early retirement is like
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.740]   So I've been going to the tennis courts in the middle of the day and now to the pickleball courts
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.820]   And I've been talking to people who are also
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.740]   retired early or who are also working from home and not really working but playing and
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:24.940]   Recently over the past three months. I've gotten to know many many pickleball players on the courts between 10 a.m
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.380]   And 3 p.m. Between Monday and Friday. I would say
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.580]   65 70% of them are over 60 traditional retirees, which leaves 30
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:42.320]   35 percent of them as 20s to 40s 30s 40s 50 year olds who have a lot of free time because they're working from home
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.660]   And I ran into this one person who we played from
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.500]   10 30 to 1 30. She's a single mom, right?
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.340]   She's an educator at a San Francisco private school
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.540]   And she was able to have three hours of fun activity and then go teach for five hours in the afternoon
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.980]   And so if you think about it, you're a single mom in supposedly expensive, San Francisco and you can make it work
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.820]   Why would you ever want to retire?
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.180]   Because you've got the best of both worlds and then I met another girl. She's 26 years old works at Google
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.500]   She also played from about 10 30 to 1 30 p.m. And
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.300]   She was working she said yeah, I just code at night and my boss really doesn't care
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.420]   So long as I get things done and that sounds great. I talked to one of our son's
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.740]   Best friends father who works at Google and he said yeah, I don't care
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.660]   I don't care if she you know
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.500]   Go plays pickleball for three hours a day or goes hiking or whatever so long as she gets her work done
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.160]   That's all that really matters. And so this trend, you know, it's in tech, right?
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:54.540]   but I think it can you know bleed to law to banking to consulting because these industries are all
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.140]   Being for the same talent pool and to attract this talent you have to stay competitive
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.100]   With the workplace flexibility, you know
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.160]   Google started it with all these perks and all you know massages in the office and
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.300]   Free childcare in the office and now working from home and I think to stay competitive
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.380]   Other companies need to provide these benefits as well. So yes, not all of us can get these
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.900]   fancy tech jobs at Google Facebook
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.100]   Apple
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.180]   Netflix wherever and sure
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.660]   Plenty of people work very very hard
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:35.580]   But I've talked to so many people since 2012 who work from home or reflex hours and they are just ecstatic
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.060]   So when you're happier at work, you don't feel like you need to retire early or quit your job or leave work
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.060]   It's very logical. What are your thoughts?
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.300]   Flexibility and autonomy, I think are two of the most coveted
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.740]   features of jobs
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:57.420]   I definitely know that my happiness went up when I started to get more autonomy in my role and then
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.940]   flexibility as well when I
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.940]   Went back to work for my employer
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.780]   After I left to come back as a consultant when they wanted me to come back
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.500]   I had so much more flexibility and it was wonderful
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.500]   it was it was a phenomenal way to
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.340]   Be able to reconnect with everyone and earn some money
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.820]   so I definitely can see how
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.300]   Flexibility can motivate people to stay in the workforce longer
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:34.000]   So if you are able to let's say I don't know run errands or exercise for two three hours a day in the middle of day
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.300]   From Monday through Friday
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.120]   Do you think you would have left your job as early as you did?
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.560]   if the
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.560]   stress was
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.040]   Manageable I could see that. Yeah
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.680]   I mean
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.540]   I I was fortunate that I had the luxury to take
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:58.560]   Easily take an hour-long lunch break and sometimes I stretch that to an hour and a half and I was definitely happier on those days
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.420]   You know or hey, you know one of my favorite buddies is like hey, let's go get let's go take a coffee break
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.880]   You know and we'd go for 20 minutes and sometimes we stretch it to 30
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.920]   And we make sure we got all our work done
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.560]   but definitely being able to have flexibility to step out of the office or to just
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.720]   You know if you're working from home to be able to control your hours
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:28.640]   Some people work really great at night. Other people work super are super productive early in the morning any kind of flexibility
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.680]   I think can produce. Oh, sorry can increase happiness and productivity
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.560]   Yeah, I remember when I was 26 years old
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:41.280]   I was working 60 hours a week and I couldn't leave the desk for more than 15 minutes because we would have inbound phone calls
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:47.540]   Yeah, and you know if I left for more than 15 20 minutes other people would have to pick up my slack pick up my phone
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:53.280]   And say hey, we're Sam. I need this what's going on? And if they weren't in the Asian equities department, they didn't know what to do
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.600]   They just like okay. I'll have them call you back. And so that was like, okay
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.520]   I had to sit at my desk
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.760]   Tethered for many many hours a day if I didn't have client meetings or a business trip
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.160]   Yeah
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.680]   and so if I could leave for two to three hours a day go play tennis because
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.280]   Exercise is also very therapeutic right? Yeah, or I go sit in the hot tub for like an hour
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.980]   I can take phones calls from there, you know after exercise
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.960]   I would probably work until my ideal retirement age of
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:28.080]   45 and that would be 11 more years of saving and investing and man we would be so much richer. What do you think?
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.560]   Yeah, I mean being well just being able to have outlets for stress during your workday
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:41.160]   Whatever your work hours are is so beneficial and this reminds me of Atlas of the heart
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.360]   I was rereading chapter one and she talks about how when she was working
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.120]   Tables as a waitress early on in her life how they had these two
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.760]   Phrases that they would use in the weeds and what was the other one?
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.120]   It's like blown out blown out or something. There's a certain phrase and
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.800]   basically when you use that word
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.600]   everybody would just take over for you for 10 minutes and
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.000]   You would be able to just do go outside just blow off
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.600]   Whatever steam you needed to scream or whatever and know that your your colleagues were gonna cover you for those 10 minutes
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.560]   Well, you would reset right and what a difference that made, you know
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:28.480]   It's not a long time 10 minutes, but just being able to have outlets for stress during a workday is is very valuable
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.320]   Yeah, and investment banking equities
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:37.000]   Whoa, that's one of the highest stress jobs for like I guess white-collar work
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.960]   it's just there's pressure over and over again and the markets are open and you know clients are losing money and
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.480]   Demands that was really stressful. So hopefully people can realize
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.000]   That you know, yeah, you work 60 hours a week
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.840]   which is 50% longer than the average 40-hour workweek and you work in a more stressful environment that can easily lead to burnout and
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:06.280]   With this flexibility Wow one one of the best things to come out of the pandemic from a professional standpoint is the acceptance
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   of working from home and
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.960]   Everybody's in cahoots folks. Everybody is in cahoots who are working at home
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:19.040]   It is so much better because you don't have to work as much or you can just control your time
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.520]   Better and here's the funny thing. It's actually not funny. It's very logical
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.320]   the most
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.540]   Hungry the go-getters out there. They actually don't want to work from home. They don't want to go into the office
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:40.220]   They want face time with their bosses build a network, you know see clients get in front of people because they know
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.640]   Smartly and wisely and rightly and correctly that the more time they spend with people
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.840]   The higher up they can potentially go because at the end of the day
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.520]   People hire and promote and take care of people who they like and who they know
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.960]   Think about this folks, you know during this mass layoff season
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.280]   Here in tech how easy it is to lay people off now when you don't have to see someone
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:14.360]   Yeah, that's true in a meeting room and say hey your services are no longer needed you get notified by an email
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.520]   Yeah, that's tough. You just break up through text message or email
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:23.120]   Yeah, it's tough for the employee because you feel like wait, what the hell? I mean, I dedicated years of my life
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.920]   You're just gonna lay me off and lock me out of my account. Yeah
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.640]   Without any like going away party. I mean that was that is something that's really painful
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.320]   But from the employers point of view, it's like click click click. I know. See you later
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.960]   But that is actually something very interesting that has come out of it
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   Given I wrote a book on severance negotiations, you know
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.400]   one of the strategies for severance negotiation or getting a severance is to
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:56.240]   Alleviate that burden that pain that embarrassment of your manager having to lay someone off
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.400]   So you say hey look, I know things are going through tough times. Maybe the stock is down 30%
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.360]   We're doing some cost cutting. I heard that from the grapevine
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.280]   I will raise my hand to get laid off so you dear boss
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:14.560]   Don't have to have that difficult conversation with someone else who might not be as amenable to getting laid off. Yeah
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.520]   strategies folks strategies for getting ahead
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.280]   strategies for
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:26.680]   Leaving and getting out, you know, it's just got to think smarter and it's a lot about human relationships
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.280]   So early retirement and fire I think was born out of misery
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.640]   The reason why I started talking about fire in 2009 was because I started to hate my job
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.720]   The you know the pressure the global financial crisis made me wonder
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   What was the point of working so hard when you would just lose money and the decline in merit-based?
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:56.640]   Compensation was also very demotivating. Can you imagine working really hard getting ranked very well with all your clients and then not getting paid?
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.080]   commensurately or at all
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:06.600]   You know that that stings and so rational people find rational solutions and my rational solution was to negotiate a severance
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:14.240]   Do something entrepreneurial so I had nobody to blame but myself and hopefully the harder I worked the more reward I would get
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:21.600]   I just wanted that correlation with effort and reward and we talked about that regarding, you know, this attack on merit or this decline in merit-based
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.520]   compensation and here's another interesting
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.400]   Reason why I believe early retirement and fire is
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.720]   Obsolete or is getting to obsolescence
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   Fire is an all-gender movement. However when I started talking about fire in 2009
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.000]   I was a man right and then a lot of
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.760]   Subsequent people who started talking and writing about fire were also men. However
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:54.160]   No stay-at-home mom says she is retired because being a mother a parent is one of the toughest jobs in the world
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:01.240]   I worked in banking for 13 years and it is easy in comparison to being a stay-at-home parent for just five or six years
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:07.280]   And I think due to stronger egos, you don't see many childless women say they are
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.400]   fire either
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:15.560]   They are just comfortable owning whatever it is. They're doing after traditional work
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:21.880]   But due to fragile egos many men are unable to admit they are stay-at-home dads
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.360]   Especially if they have a working spouse
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.720]   Rather they opt to label themselves as anything but stay-at-home dads out of pride
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.440]   You know, they come up with replacement terms such as early retiree
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:40.960]   fire entrepreneur author podcaster musician consultant freelancer coach investor gig worker
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.560]   It just goes on and on and on and anything but admitting
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.920]   We are stay-at-home dads
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:55.160]   So I wanted to get your perspective Cindy on why do you think that is and why do you think you don't hear?
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:02.600]   Females saying oh, they're financially independent while they have a working husband making money and you know providing health care insurance
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.880]   well, I can say that as a working mom that
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.520]   It is so much work to take care of young children, especially
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:17.600]   You know, I can't voice what it's like to take care of older children except from what I've heard from my friends
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:24.520]   And they always talk about being so busy having to transport their kids to all these various activities
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:29.480]   But yeah having young children, it's it's work. It's I
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.280]   Don't like to call it work because it's taking care of our our family
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.040]   But it it's it's hard and it takes a lot of time and energy
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.160]   patience
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.880]   and
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.680]   Yeah, I mean working part-time as well trying to fit it in, you know
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.160]   It's it's a lot to do and in terms of the dad side
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:56.280]   I'm gonna call out Brene Brown again because she's on my on the top of my mind
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.600]   I've been watching her podcast not her podcast her TED talks and such in her books
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:07.760]   She talks a lot about shame and vulnerability and I can totally see that as a reason why a lot of men don't want to
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.120]   talk about being stay-at-home dads because I think they feel a
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.040]   sense of
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.040]   Shame to admit that they're not
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.880]   providing income
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.200]   When they used to perhaps I mean, I don't want to
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:28.320]   Put you know all these men into a box and label them, but I could see how that might be a reason
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:34.280]   You know from an emotional standpoint of why they don't want to call themselves a stay-at-home father
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:42.240]   And and so but the other reason might be maybe because mothers spend on average more time with their children
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.920]   Yeah, and so therefore they definitely feel like they're not retired because they're spending more time
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:55.120]   Quote working to take care of their children. Yeah, whereas men spend less time on average
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.160]   therefore
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160]   Maybe they just can't
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:06.680]   Own to the fact that they are stay-at-home dads and providers because maybe men feel guilty that they're not doing
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:13.320]   Their part or enough work to consider themselves a stay-at-home fathers. Yeah
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:19.800]   I'm still curious though because taking care of children vulnerable children who are still learning and who need as much
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:28.520]   Help and education and love and support as possible. Why is this considered not an admirable job for men?
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.320]   I think because it's still rare
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:36.760]   I know when you know, our son was still young and his baby and toddler years
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.120]   You didn't meet very many
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.280]   Stay-at-home dads. I mean, did you I don't even remember if you met one who was
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.720]   Doing that as his primary role. I feel like it's still very
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:56.920]   Very rare. Yeah, I do remember taking him like when he was two years old to Golden Gate Park to the Botanical Garden with
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.560]   three or four other mothers and
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:06.760]   I think no he was six months to 12 months and then it was kind of awkward because we sat in a circle and then
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.360]   Three out of the five mothers started breastfeeding. Oh, this was a mom's thing. Oh, it was yeah
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.520]   it was a mom's meetup that I was going to and you came along because
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:25.800]   You had the flexibility. So that's a little bit of a different scenario because it was a scheduled meetup for mom
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.640]   Yeah, so I mean out of respect and courtesy I walked away, you know just to give
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.560]   The moms more privacy and comfort, but okay that was specifically but yeah
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:41.000]   I didn't meet many stay-at-home dads. There was a Facebook group that you joined
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.840]   Yeah, or a meetup dad parent. I never like I never meet up with them. Yeah, there weren't that
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.880]   I just feel like there weren't that many. Yeah, so we're really a minority. Yeah, and so when you're a minority
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.120]   Let's say you're a minority minority
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:01.760]   There's just not a very supportive outlet and I guess when you read articles online a lot of the articles online talk about
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:08.700]   The anguish of mother is trying to do it all to have their career and be mothers. You never read about. Oh the
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:14.740]   Dad guilt that men are trying to do it all and be fathers and providers as well
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:19.280]   it's very unbalanced and I think partly the reason why it's unbalanced is because
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.360]   You know in the beginning or a while ago. We're trying to help more women
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.800]   Do it all do more have their careers go to college be successful business people
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:36.200]   But I give you props for talking about these topics and your podcast and in your articles because you've talked about fatherhood a lot
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:42.680]   Over the years and I think there are a lot of dads out there who have left comments about how appreciative
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:49.360]   They are of the feelings that you voice that you have the courage to talk about the uncomfortable things
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.000]   That you felt in your journey as a father
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:53.580]   Yeah
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.780]   I really really if you're a father out there who wants to spend more time taking care of your children
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:06.200]   Don't let society or your buddies or women make you feel bad for spending more time with your children
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.580]   Nothing is more priceless. Nothing is more valuable than that
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:16.160]   I think you're not gonna regret spending more time with your children when you look back when they're older
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.860]   It's just one of those things where it's just kind of like I don't think you're gonna regret working hard
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:26.380]   At your job or doing something because the reward is worth it, please
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:34.740]   Don't feel embarrassed for no longer having day jobs feel proud of your partner your
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.940]   girlfriend your wives
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:43.300]   For earning money providing for your family providing health care, you know support their careers
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.860]   You know, this is something that I really admire
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:52.260]   Anybody who you know just goes out there and pursues what they want. We have you know, there's one mother
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.900]   In our school and she has this she's a chef
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:01.740]   right and we watch her show and it's on the food network and it's just so admirable to see her go out there and
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:08.980]   Cook and also try to build her business empire. Yeah being able to follow your dreams and pursue what you love is
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:16.020]   Is a very valuable thing and not everyone is able to follow their dreams
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.980]   when they want to and for those of you who have a dream that you're really passionate about
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:28.940]   Don't give up, you know, even if you can't do everything that you want right now. Keep going don't give up on
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.140]   your path to happiness
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.860]   so with less men ashamed about
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:42.920]   Saying they are stay-at-home dads and with society being more accepting of stay-at-home dads
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.940]   I think fire and early retirement
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:50.460]   Therefore is becoming less popular because less men will start
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:56.580]   Needing to shout on the internet or in social media or to their friends that they're everything else
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.780]   but being a stay-at-home dad you can say I'm a stay-at-home dad and
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:09.100]   I'm a freelancer. I'm a stay-at-home dad and I'm an author but put that stay-at-home fatherhood up first
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.340]   You know say it with your chest be proud
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:18.500]   yeah, and finally the reason why early retirement is becoming obsolete is because there are
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.940]   Many many ways to make money now
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:28.100]   Thanks to technology and the internet some commentators have said well my thesis
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.980]   that fire is becoming obsolete is not inclusive of
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.540]   construction workers or
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:39.860]   Secretaries or nonprofit organization people or anybody who has to be in the office
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.380]   Every single day to help
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:47.720]   Society thrive and I say no I say no it is inclusive of
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.780]   Them because the internet is inclusive of everybody
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.620]   Everybody has access to the internet now if you can't afford it at home
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:01.900]   You can go to the library you can learn anything you want for free on the internet nowadays so to say
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.020]   You know my thesis is not inclusive
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:12.300]   I think is incorrect because anybody can go online to learn and to make money if they have the audacity
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:17.100]   To try I'm not talking about instantly replacing your day job income
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.820]   I'm saying you don't have to retire early from a terrible miserable job
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.540]   Because there are more opportunities now you can supplement
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.180]   your day job income
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:36.420]   With online income or different ways to make money right there's blogging podcasting youtubing courses
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:43.240]   Editing freelancing consulting you can do everything on the internet every single company has an online website where you can
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:49.220]   Order or connect with people in addition no college education is required
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.180]   Yeah, about 65 68 percent of high school students nowadays go to college
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:59.740]   65% of all Americans have college degrees and you know what that's actually another the great thing about the internet
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.580]   You don't need a college education. You can learn everything for free
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:10.160]   You can start your website start your podcast do anything you want if you focus and try alright folks
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.340]   We would love to hear your thoughts on whether you believe the trend towards early retirement
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:23.900]   Fire is becoming obsolete or not one of the reasons why I decided to start this fake retirement movement
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:31.140]   Was so that more people can have an outlet to have permission to make money from other than their day jobs
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:36.460]   So not have to be pigeonholed to either being retired or working
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:43.540]   Thanks so much for listening. If you enjoyed this podcast episode or this entire series, we'd love a awesome 5-star review
