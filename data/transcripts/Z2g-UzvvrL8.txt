[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   Today is May 17th, and over at worldmag.com, a new poem of yours was published, Pastor
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.280]   John.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.160]   It's a serious poem titled "Grace Forfeited, Adam, Tamerlan, and the Lady."
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.320]   It's a poem about justice in regard to the school shooting in Newtown and the death of
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.400]   the first suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.080]   Explain the background of this poem for us and the biblical categories you explore in
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.080]   it.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.320]   On the 6th of December, 14, Adam Lanza shot and killed 22 six-year-old, eight-year-old
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.200]   children.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.920]   And then he shot himself.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.920]   And that was that.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.460]   And Tamerlan Chaniyev bombed the marathon with his brother.
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.720]   He killed three people, ripped the legs off a dozen others whose lives are forever changed,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.640]   and then he was killed in a rain of bullets and some head trauma by the police.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.640]   But that was that.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.420]   I mean, there goes Tamerlan.
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.480]   And here's the question I've been asking.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.900]   Has justice been done because they're dead?
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.900]   Can you hatefully, wantonly slaughter people created in the image of God and then get away
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.560]   with it through suicide?
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.440]   A millisecond, a millisecond of pain.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.080]   Can you thumb your nose at the punishment of the state or at God and end it your own
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.080]   way?
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.280]   Can you rob—this is one of the characters in the poem—can you rob Lady Justice of
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.640]   her perfect rectitude in your case?
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.520]   And the poem answers, no, you cannot.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.680]   This world is not one long injustice ending in nothingness.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.680]   Lady Justice, you know, if you see the picture of her with her scales, she's always blindfolded,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.040]   and that's to show impartiality.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.740]   But one of the paradoxes in the poem is, though blindfolded, none of her people that she has
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.100]   assigned justice to ever escapes her final decrees.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:24.160]   That last pop of the gun to your own head is heard on the other side of hope like a
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.300]   slamming door, and the guilty who have spurned the grace of God all their lives suddenly
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.180]   realize, "I am not dead."
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.600]   And there she stands with perfect recompense in her hand.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:51.000]   And so that was my effort to try to capture and wrestle with whether suicide really can
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.960]   be viewed as a just end for a killer of 22 children.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.560]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.220]   The text of the new poem, "Grace Forfeited, Adam, Tamerlane, and the Lady," was posted
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.600]   at DesiringGod.org today, along with the audio of Pastor John reading the poem recently in
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.280]   the DG Studio, and I'll add that reading to the end of this Ask Pastor John episode.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.500]   Thanks for listening.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.200]   Was Adam Lance's bullet to the head with all its millisecond length of dread and suffering
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   a fitting recompense for 20 children dead?
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.600]   And the events of Boston's bloody marathon, is one hour's bullet riddle dying how it's
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.500]   done?
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:43.560]   Is that the penalty for killing three and ripping off our legs as if a knee could run?
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   Can Tamerlane and Adam rob so easily the state of its last job of punishing these crimes?
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.940]   Perhaps.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.560]   But not the Lady Justice.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.360]   No.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.340]   In truth, she got her verdict, firm.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.860]   And she is not so blind that any criminal by her consigned to suffer suitably could
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:18.220]   ever slip away through merest mortal stings or skip her perfect rectitude through suicide.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.580]   Nor is her ladyship so dignified among the cynical elite that she would bow to their
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.300]   philosophy and lose her right to judge, her sacred breath, by not at last existing after
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.720]   death.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:44.140]   As if this bloody universe were one long empty triumph of injustice, done by no one, leaping
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:51.180]   into nothingness from dreams where there is nothing to transgress.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.420]   No.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:02.140]   Those last pistol pops in Sandy Hook and Watertown pursued and overtook their prey
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:09.280]   and echoed like a slamming door heard on the other side of time and tore away the fatal
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.880]   hope that they were dead.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.540]   They were not dead.
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.420]   Nor she.
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.820]   And flaming dread.
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:28.380]   In her right hand the Lady held the chains and in her left the everlasting pains.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.440]   you
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.500]   you
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.560]   you
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
