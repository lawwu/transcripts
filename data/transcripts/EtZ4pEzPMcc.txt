[00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.800]   Hi, Jeremy from Answer.ai here.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.480]   And today I'm joined by Isaac to talk about his new project
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.200]   called Monster UI.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.800]   So good day, Isaac.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.080]   How are you doing?
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.840]   I'm doing good.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.640]   How about yourself?
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.120]   I'm great.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.440]   I am so pumped about this, I'm going
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.160]   to skip all forms of introduction
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.080]   and just jump straight into showing off this thing
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.960]   that you've built. This is an example of something
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520]   built with Monster UI.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.400]   And so Monster UI is providing the components for this.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.720]   And it's got some neat things, like as I'm scrolling,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.480]   you might see, watching, that the thing on the left-hand side
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.280]   is moving.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   Also, the thing at the top is changing,
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.840]   which one is emboldened, if you like.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.320]   So that's all written in Monster UI.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.480]   This is written in Monster UI, a little ticket popped up
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.640]   written in Monster UI.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.760]   This is written in Monster UI.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.640]   And for all of these things, I can look at the code,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.600]   click C code.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.800]   And this blows my mind a bit.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.280]   This is actually the entire thing.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.480]   It's all in one file.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.680]   If I click Copy, I quite like--
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.520]   this one's pretty amazing.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.640]   Be interesting to see how to build this, perhaps,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.960]   because there's a lot going on here.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.840]   And I played around with this earlier today,
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.300]   and I noticed, actually, it's even got some functionality,
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.800]   like clicking on these Xs makes them disappear.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.560]   And if I click C code, it's all one file.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.160]   So I'm just going to try copying that.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.280]   Head over to VS Code and paste it.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.000]   So you run it, main.py.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.640]   And let's head over to--
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.760]   oh, there it is.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.080]   And it's super fast.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.560]   And so what is that, 140 lines of code,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.280]   which includes the sample data, the SVGs.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.080]   And the other thing I notice about this
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.160]   is that there isn't very much Tailwind or CSS or whatever.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160]   I see there's a space Y4 here, for instance.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.880]   But on the whole, it's all very much--
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.760]   you're just saying, oh, I want to space the stuff in here.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.680]   I want to stack the stuff in here.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.720]   I want a navigation here.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.520]   And it all just plays pretty much nicely.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.640]   So I don't know.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.560]   It feels like someone like me, Isaac, who's not
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.800]   at all really a designer, I feel like you've built this for me.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.880]   I should be able to make something look this nice.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.640]   Is that the idea, without fiddling around with CSS
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.240]   and Tailwind and whatnot?
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.960]   ISAAC KOHANE: Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.760]   I built it for me.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.840]   But I'm glad you appreciate it as well.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.160]   I wanted something where I could easily
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.600]   build websites that really look nice without tons
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.640]   of optimizations and classes and strings
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.440]   and being an expert in CSS and JavaScript.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.000]   And so I built this library so that you
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.280]   can make production-looking apps without knowing
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.680]   all of that information.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.880]   And we should say, so originally, I
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.520]   suggested you start on this project
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.120]   some months ago as being basically a wrapper
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.000]   for Franken UI.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.880]   This is Franken UI.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.040]   This is an example from Franken UI.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.280]   It should look very familiar.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.480]   And so the first thing we should mention, of course,
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.560]   is a huge amount of gratitude to Franken UI
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.720]   because we are actually building on top of their work.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:36.800]   But a big difference here is that in Franken UI,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.720]   that requires a huge amount of code
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.760]   with lots of somewhat inscrutable kinds of classes
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.320]   and whatnot.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.360]   Whereas the difference here is--
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.920]   actually, this is tasks, so let's go back to tasks.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:11.560]   The difference here is that your code basically
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.120]   has none of that.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.360]   It's got an icon.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.320]   They're left-aligned.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.240]   There's a centered bit.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.560]   So what you've done here is you've
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.760]   taken the great work from Franken UI
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.680]   and taken advantage of FastHTML to use that kind of syntax.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.840]   But you've also added some defaults and things.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.760]   Would that be a fair description?
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.400]   Yeah, I mean, that's exactly right.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.720]   One of the things you see-- there's lots of examples.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.080]   But when you have things on a page,
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.480]   you never want them super scrunched up.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.080]   You always want a default spacing.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.360]   And so there is a default spacing.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.280]   And you've got some nice descriptions of that
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.480]   here as well, showing how I can change those things
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.840]   and what they all mean.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.480]   But out of the box, you get pretty good defaults.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.040]   I mean, you'll always have small things that you want to modify
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.080]   and tweak yourself.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080]   Defaults are great.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.720]   And when you need to, you can use Tailwind directly as well,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.840]   at any piece on any component.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.120]   And one of those examples I recognized as actually
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.520]   being from Daisy UI.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.680]   So Daisy UI is another really nice library.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.760]   So this is kind of bringing in some of the best bits
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.680]   of multiple frameworks under a single unified banner.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.840]   Yeah, and the themes all sync together.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.720]   And you might see that code rendering.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.560]   This code rendering is using HighlightJS.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.120]   So that's another thing that's integrated in as well.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.720]   Where do I see the code rendering?
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.920]   Oh, you mean when I clicked on C code?
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.480]   Yeah, any of this code where it has the code highlighting.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.600]   Instead of it being just black text,
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.880]   the reason it's got the syntax highlighting
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.440]   and the copy button, all that is--
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.080]   So this site, of course, is written in FastHTML and Monster
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.400]   UI itself.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.860]   I get all these nice little things.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.920]   Like when I hover over something,
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.800]   I get a little 3D effect.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.000]   Actually, if you go to C code, I can show you
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.480]   how that's done, which is kind of neat.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:27.040]   So if you look for card T, there it is, cardT.hover.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.720]   OK, and that's the class.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.320]   And just people not so familiar with FastHTML,
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.960]   we say CLS rather than CLASS, because class
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.280]   is a reserved word in Python.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:44.520]   We should also mention that Franken UI, in turn,
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.760]   is built on top of something called ShadCN.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.320]   ShadCN, again, looks very similar.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.880]   ShadCN is different, though, that it's
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.200]   built with and for React.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.880]   So Franken UI is kind of nice.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.440]   It extracts it out into something
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.920]   that everybody can use, regardless
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.440]   of what framework you use.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.480]   And so we should also say a lot of gratitude
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:14.280]   to ShadCN for inspiring a whole lot of this, which
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:20.200]   obviously we and Franken UI have entirely
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.320]   taken their inspiration, even for the examples
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.880]   and for the components and so forth.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.760]   So that's been amazing.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.800]   Yeah, it's interesting, these--
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.480]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff in this documentation here,
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.720]   which I really like.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.520]   So the way we can see all the different kinds of semantic
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.560]   HTML you can use, and if we can see highlighting and citing
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:56.200]   and quotes and dates all mapped to a mark to highlight
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.120]   and a quote to quote and a cite to cite.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.520]   This kind of semantic HTML is not so common nowadays,
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.040]   but I think it's a kind of thing that might actually
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.480]   help me to be able to write things that work well.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.000]   Yeah, and I think it's useful to note--
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.480]   some people might recognize this,
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.520]   but this mark element, and this block quote,
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.000]   and this cite element, and this EM for emphasis.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.720]   Like, I didn't make these up.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.240]   These are part of the HTML spec that I'm
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.880]   kind of building on top of.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.600]   Oh, so I shouldn't have clicked on that.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.960]   Let me actually do that.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.320]   So we're doing cite.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.560]   Here we are, right-click, Inspect.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.600]   Here it is, cite.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.200]   Block quote.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.240]   Yeah, address.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.800]   And so it's nice, right, because I
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.160]   think people spend a lot of time deciding what
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.000]   elements to put into HTML.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.280]   And so being able to use those is probably
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.880]   going to cover a lot of the things that you actually need.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.800]   And by default, they're all going to look reasonable.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.960]   A lot of people don't realize that there's actually
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.400]   a keyboard shortcut element in HTML.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.200]   And I see here you've got all this stuff added to it,
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.560]   but that's happening behind the scenes.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.960]   But when I use that keyboard shortcut,
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.720]   I don't have to worry about any of that.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.640]   You do it all for us.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.640]   Whereabouts is it?
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.600]   Keyboard shortcut.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.760]   There we go.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.800]   Which is pretty cool.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.360]   That's right.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.440]   I mean, the goal for me is to have it
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.920]   that if you just use the defaults almost all the time,
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.040]   you get something that looks reasonably good.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.400]   And that lets you build nice and quickly,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.640]   and then spends your time on the bits of UI
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.600]   that are really important for differentiators
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.560]   or interesting.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.840]   Kind of gets you 80% or 90% of the way there,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.120]   and maybe 5% or 10% of the time.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:12.200]   And because also we are using fast HTML,
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.240]   we can add the live equals true, which
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   means that we can then change payment method to payment.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.480]   And you can see it automatically changes
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.600]   without me having to refresh there.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.600]   Change it back again.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.080]   Press Save.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.640]   It's come back again here.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.160]   And I think that's kind of nice for experimenting
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.960]   with these little changes.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.480]   So for example, maybe I wanted to change the border
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.680]   to make it a bit thicker.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.880]   Would border 4 potentially work?
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.920]   Try that.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.600]   And we should see--
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.200]   there you go.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.640]   The border's been made a bit thicker.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.960]   Like, oh, it's a bit too thick.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.880]   Change that to 3.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.720]   So you can kind of--
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.440]   that's interesting.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.200]   There is no 3.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.360]   So that's also good to know.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.200]   That's presumably a Tailwind thing,
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.240]   which I wouldn't have known about.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.160]   So it's nice to get that real-time feedback.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.600]   Is that something you use a bit as you're doing it?
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.920]   You kind of--
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.960]   Yeah, I always use it, and I'm always doing it.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:19.120]   There's things like, if you're doing UI kind of all the time
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.040]   and using Tailwind a lot, you might remember
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.960]   that there's a border 2, and a border 1, and a border 4,
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.880]   but not a border 3.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.320]   I don't use it enough to have that memorized.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.000]   And so this quick iteration is critical.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.680]   Also things like DiceBear, which is an icon service.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.400]   I can see you're using that to get these automatic icons, which
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.680]   is very convenient for quick prototyping.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.360]   I feel like this is perhaps one of the best, or maybe
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.160]   the best example I've seen of this idea
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.360]   that perhaps we can start to--
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.840]   in fact, I know a number of companies
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.160]   are moving away from stuff like Figma,
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.360]   and instead basically having the designers work directly
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:03.120]   with the HTML, potentially using language models.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.680]   And I did want to mention, actually,
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.040]   one thing that I love that you've done with MonsterUI
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:16.560]   is that you're following the LLMs.txt standard.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:26.880]   And so I did actually grab this really nice list of examples
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.960]   and so forth, which I added to Visual Studio Code.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:45.720]   And I do find that I could grab this and say,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:59.440]   change this example to use a left-aligned div container
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:16.560]   instead of a grid.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.240]   And yeah, it's there, which is cool.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.560]   So that's a really nice feature for me,
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.880]   is that I can use LLMs to help me.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.960]   And because it's built on top of Tailwind, the stuff
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.560]   that LLMs already know and that designers already
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.440]   know about Tailwind, you can still take advantage of.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.440]   Although perhaps the thing I like best, though,
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.160]   is I don't necessarily know about what
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160]   options to use for text.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.640]   So your classes, you've done as enums.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.800]   So I can select from options or my different lower-level text
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.600]   types--
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.480]   capitalize, lowercase, muted.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.880]   Again, I can choose from.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.640]   And that works pretty much everywhere.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.720]   So it's cool that for a class, you can have not only a string,
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.920]   but you can also have these enums you've built,
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.880]   tuples of them, tuples of enums and strings, just strings.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.680]   It makes it really--
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.960]   You can add them together, too.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.080]   You can use addition if you don't like tuples.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.240]   Uh-huh, yeah.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.480]   Yeah, I think that's pretty amazing.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:50.400]   So this idea of a server-side kind of rendered library,
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.960]   it's pretty new.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.240]   It's not something that we've necessarily quite seen before
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.720]   in this way.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.880]   But it's part of our vision at Answer.ai
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.400]   for making coding dramatically easier for everybody,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:13.680]   both humans and AI, without losing any of the flexibility.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.360]   So you've got the full power of all HTML, all Tailwind,
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.200]   all DAISY, all HTTP.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.080]   It's not like the kind of dashboard-type things
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.880]   which give you your own little mini-language.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.400]   And so, Isaac, I know you've been
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.720]   building all kinds of stuff, like a kind
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.640]   of new type of dynamic blog from scratch.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.640]   You've built stuff for our legal team.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.120]   Yeah, what's your experience been like of using
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.400]   FastHTML and HTMX and Monster UI,
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.200]   this kind of very new and fairly revolutionary approach
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.080]   to writing web apps?
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.480]   Well, it's been great.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.720]   I actually always wanted to do a lot of web app development
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.040]   because sharing what you build with other people
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.160]   is a lot of fun.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.840]   It's pleasant.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.360]   And it's kind of essential if you
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.760]   want to have something commercially viable.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.560]   Someone else has to see it.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.480]   And web apps is one way to do that.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.960]   I had a really tough time with trying to set up
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.600]   stuff in prior frameworks.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.880]   It all felt very complicated, lots of config files,
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.360]   lots of build steps, a hard time iterating.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   I found FastHTML a lot easier.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.800]   I found the styling was still challenging for me
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.200]   in FastHTML, which is when I started building Monster UI.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.760]   And yeah, it's been great.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.400]   I mean, I never would have imagined.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.720]   I was having trouble with some of these services
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.600]   to create a Twitter threat.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.240]   And I found some things frustrating.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:01.520]   And I built a SQLite-backed Twitter thread generator
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.480]   that I can store stuff in and change things
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.080]   with in a couple of hours.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.560]   I built the blog in a couple of hours.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.600]   And it's styled with Monster UI and Tailwind.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.480]   And yeah, it's been great.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.880]   HTMX simplifies things a ton as well.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.560]   It takes a little bit to get used to, a paradigm.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.200]   But once you put a little bit of time in,
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.560]   it really makes a lot of sense.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.800]   And it allows you to simplify your code and move really fast
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.640]   and have it look great as well.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.080]   So it's been great.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.680]   So to get started, folks can just pip install Monster UI.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.560]   And I would say going through and just doing
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.360]   what I just did, which is pasting some of the examples
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.560]   into VS Code or Cursor or Vim or whatever and run it.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.120]   It's a standalone single file.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.240]   There's nothing else to do.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:53.880]   You just run it.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:59.800]   And then you go to localhost colon 5001, play with it,
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.560]   change things, see what happens.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.360]   And then the other thing I do is I've just
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.160]   been going through your API reference
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.720]   just to see what all the stuff you have is.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.640]   And I try to use each piece.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.840]   And I often find it inspires ideas
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.760]   around things I could build or changing
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.440]   things I've already built.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.600]   Any other suggestions for folks looking
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.320]   to get started with FastHTML and Monster UI, Isaac?
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.400]   I think that covers it.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.160]   I mean, we have the FastHTML gallery,
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.760]   which has a lot of HTMX examples to understand a little bit more
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.760]   about HTMX, which is helpful for FastHTML.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.200]   But yeah, I'd say just kind of start playing with stuff,
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.480]   start building stuff.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.880]   I think going through the API reference for Monster UI
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.480]   is particularly important.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.120]   It's not an API reference like you go through
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:58.560]   and you just see doc strings where it's
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.240]   hard to tell how it renders.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.800]   There's examples built in that are practical.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.520]   And you can play with them.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.360]   You can try and shrink them and see if they're
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.800]   responsive automatically.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.600]   You can see a few example forms.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.040]   If you go to the card section, you
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.200]   can see what a blog card might look like and the code for it.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.400]   And so that really helps to understand
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.680]   what's there is the visual aspect of the docs as well.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:35.640]   And all of these examples are actual running web applications
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.240]   that you can play with.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:47.160]   They're not static images, so for example--
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.200]   Yeah, and with that, you can be confident
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.840]   that the code on the left works because the code on the left
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.560]   is what's running.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.640]   That's it.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.160]   That's the whole code for infinite scroll, which is crazy.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.400]   And so yeah, OK, so I mean, that's not Monster UI,
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.200]   but it's kind of Monster UI and FastHTML go hand in hand.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:12.000]   And these kind of-- nice to see some of these Daisy UI
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.400]   examples, which perhaps some of these
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.680]   will start adding some more Monster UI to the gallery
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.480]   as well.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.280]   Yeah, and I'd love to see what people build
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.520]   and what they feel is missing, what they want to build.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.880]   So yeah, reach out and--
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.880]   Open source project on GitHub so people
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.600]   can add issues, PRs for new components, and so forth.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.360]   Yeah, can't wait to see what people built with Monster UI.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.800]   So congrats, Isaac, for the release.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.840]   And thank you for the folks behind ShedCN, FrankenUI,
