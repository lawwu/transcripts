[00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.940]   Leveraging AI for everything.
[00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.240]   Whether you like ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude or Perplexity,
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.240]   I'm impartial to what tool you use.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.260]   But for travel planning, for research,
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.000]   I feel like I have an army of interns at my disposal
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.040]   to go do all kinds of stuff.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.020]   Can you draft this?
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.140]   Can you review this legal doc?
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.820]   Can you help me come up with an itinerary?
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.000]   Can you go research something for personal life, for work?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.820]   Can you help me summarize this?
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.060]   It's just such an amazing tool.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.300]   I can't imagine how much longer it would take me
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.080]   to do all kinds of work in my life than it does now.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.900]   And if you're not using any of these tools regularly,
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.340]   I would strongly encourage you to give them a try.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.040]   I would encourage you to find someone in your circle of friends
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.720]   that probably uses them more than you
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.060]   and ask them how they're using them
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.600]   because I'm constantly getting new ideas of ways to do things.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.580]   This morning, my daughter asked,
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.980]   how many sprinkles are on my pancakes?
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.640]   And there were more than enough on her plate
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.520]   than I wanted to count.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.680]   And we were like, oh, I wonder if ChatGPT could answer.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.320]   It's at a number about 4,000.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740]   So I will say that's not the best example of something you can do.
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.600]   But I'm always experimenting for ways
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.120]   that some AI tool could save me time
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.040]   or get me to a better answer sooner.
