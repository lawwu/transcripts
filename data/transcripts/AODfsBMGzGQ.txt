[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.360]   With us again this week, the dictator himself,
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.240]   Chamath Palihapitiya, the queen of kinwa, David Friedberg,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   and coming back from Portugal and the Solana Conference,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.960]   riding his--
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.800]   - Where heroin and prostitution are legal.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.640]   David Sacks.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.060]   - Well, we were gonna double click on that,
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.900]   but you jumped the gun here on the docket.
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.040]   So David, how was the heroin in Portugal?
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.680]   - Great.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.520]   - Great, okay.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.800]   How you having, folks?
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.600]   - I was fully drinking the Kool-Aid
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.920]   at the Solana Conference.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.480]   It wasn't heroin, it was Kool-Aid.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.120]   - It was literally Kool-Aid.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.400]   How many people were at the Solana Conference in Portugal?
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.000]   Why is it in Portugal?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.320]   What happens at a Solana Crypto Conference?
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.920]   - I think there were thousands of people there,
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.280]   and it was, I mean, easily.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.600]   And I mean, it was kind of a madhouse,
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.240]   and people were trying to get in last minute,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.400]   nobody could get in,
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.280]   'cause the conference was like totally sold out.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.160]   It was...
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.480]   There were a lot of crypto developers,
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.720]   a lot of people with projects.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.280]   And why Portugal?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.000]   I think because there's a lot of conferences
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.960]   happening in Portugal right now,
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.600]   because they are easier on the COVID restrictions
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.000]   than a lot of other countries.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.160]   So you can actually get in there and host a conference.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.280]   - What was it, indoors with no masks?
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.800]   For masks optional?
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.640]   - I can't remember if like masks were required or not.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.000]   I did see people wearing masks indoors, so.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.600]   - Were you required to be vaccinated?
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.520]   Did they do tests on the way in?
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.560]   - I think I did show a vaccine pass
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.120]   at one point when I checked in.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.360]   - I just did my booster.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.920]   - I'm gonna do my booster shortly.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.680]   - It kind of, it was a little,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.120]   I would say the same kind of shitty feeling
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.280]   as the second one.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.120]   - Hmm.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.200]   - Which kind though?
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.560]   - I just got, I mean, I had the first two were Pfizer,
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.480]   so I took Pfizer.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.000]   She was, the nurse actually gave me a choice.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.200]   She's like, "You can do whatever you want,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.400]   Pfizer, Moderna, or J&J."
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.840]   I just, I didn't know any better.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.160]   I texted my doctor.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.880]   So I just took Pfizer.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.400]   Although the interesting thing is,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.600]   Moderna is the only one that's dose regulated
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.440]   for the third dose.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.080]   So there's a, they actually give you less specifically,
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.280]   but Pfizer is the same for all three.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.680]   - I think we talked about this on the pod.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.560]   There's one theory which,
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.480]   they told you get whatever one you can get,
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.400]   was the instructions,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.840]   because it's more important to just get one
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.720]   than which one you get.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.520]   But they said there's a Swiss cheese theory,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.440]   which is if you took two slices of Swiss cheese
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.720]   from two different bricks of it,
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.480]   the holes would not be the same,
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.840]   and therefore you overlap them.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.240]   So whichever deficiencies each one had,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.200]   maybe the other one doesn't.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.760]   - So I should have gotten Moderna, is what you're saying.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.160]   - That would be, if you believe in the Swiss cheese theory,
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.520]   I don't know, Friedberg or a science guy,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.360]   you believe in this?
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.840]   - I should ask Aaron Rodgers what he thinks.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.120]   - I mean, he just straight up lied
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.960]   about being vaccinated, huh?
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.000]   - I think so.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.960]   And I think the NFL's not doing anything about it.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.000]   - Yeah.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.520]   - That's not cool.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.520]   Why would you lie about it?
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.560]   I mean, he would have still been allowed to play,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.360]   so there was no reason to lie about it.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.960]   I'm not totally up on that story.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.600]   The rumor is that Kyrie is gonna be playing basketball soon.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.440]   Because New York--
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.840]   - 'Cause Eric Adams is gonna lift the vaccine restrictions.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.680]   - Yes.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.680]   You will not need to show a vaccine card or wear a mask.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.520]   - Bro, I don't think it's gonna--
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.640]   - Or maybe he'll just get a PCR test every day.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.560]   - I don't think it's gonna matter
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.000]   because the Warriors are shooting the lights out
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.160]   and Klay hasn't even come back yet, and so--
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.000]   - Oof.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.680]   That Gary Payton, the second kid is--
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.280]   - Did you see Gary Payton Jr., these clips?
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.120]   Oh my God.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.560]   - The second, I mean, he's like living above the rim--
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.960]   - Oh my gosh, animal. - And just destroying it,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.440]   Wiseman's-- - Animal, animal.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.440]   - Is Wiseman back?
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.200]   And then Wiggins is playing great basketball.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.800]   I mean, the Warriors are gonna win this year.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.640]   I don't know.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.120]   - Steph is otherworldly right now.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.920]   - Yeah, I think Steph's got something to prove,
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.760]   even though he doesn't,
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.240]   but he's playing like he's got something to prove.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.240]   Okay, so do we wanna just cover the elephant in the room?
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.800]   The last episode, I think we should just get out of the way
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.960]   'cause it relates to Solana.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.280]   There was, we took something out of the last podcast
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.320]   so people understand we have an agreement
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.360]   between the four of us.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.120]   If there's something that somebody doesn't want on the pod
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.400]   after we record it, we'll take it out
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.320]   'cause we don't want anybody,
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.560]   I mean, I think the philosophy,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.000]   we haven't said this out loud,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.920]   is we don't want anybody to say something they regret
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.320]   that could cause damage to other people or to themselves.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.240]   So if they wanna take something out that they said,
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.000]   that's fine with all of us.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.800]   And basically each of us has veto right on something.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.920]   So last week, two people took their veto right on something
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.280]   and we took something out.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.160]   You wanna explain? - Yeah.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.600]   - What you're thinking on that, Sax,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.240]   and why we're reversing it.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.280]   - Yeah, okay, so a few weeks ago on the pod,
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.480]   there was an oblique reference between me and Chamath
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.120]   regarding Solana.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.840]   And so some internet theorists claimed
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.640]   that we were trying to engineer a pump and dump in Solana,
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.200]   which if you actually listen to what we said,
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.840]   it certainly is not a pump.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.800]   Let me explain what it was.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.680]   So Kraft is the beneficiary because we invest,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.000]   we're the first investors in multi-competition,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.440]   we put in something like 40% of the money
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.920]   for their special opportunity fund.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   They were one of the first investors in Solana.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.920]   So we are the beneficiary of about a billion dollars of Solana.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.520]   So thank you, multi-coin.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   At some point, well, so they have started doing distributions,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   but at the time I texted Chamath,
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.520]   they hadn't really started doing distributions.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   I didn't know how deep and liquid the market for Solana was.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.080]   I just asked Chamath, like I'd heard,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.720]   Chamath made a lot of money in the market,
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.840]   but I didn't know how deep and liquid the market for Solana was.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.680]   Chamath may have said something that he was long Solana
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.560]   and wanted to accumulate.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.400]   So I sent him a text saying, "Hey, are you interested?
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.280]   I thought maybe we could do an OTC transaction
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.440]   at some point when we get our Solana."
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.600]   He basically, we had a brief exchange about that.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.720]   And then he mentioned it on the pod.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.880]   That was the extent of it.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.080]   What I didn't know at the time,
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.360]   but learned subsequently is that the market for Solana
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.680]   is very deep, about three and a half billion.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.200]   Notional is traded every day.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.160]   So there's no need, even if we wanted to fully get out
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.680]   of our Solana position, which by the way,
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.600]   we don't even have, multi-coin still has most of it.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.400]   It's not necessary to do an OTC transaction.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.360]   We could just sell it.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.720]   Explain what OTC transaction is.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.040]   It just means over the counter.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.040]   It just means that instead of going to like an exchange,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.480]   you would deal with like a trading desk
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.960]   or it could just be direct, like for me to Chamath.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.280]   So that was basically the exchange.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.200]   Chamath and I talked about it for maybe two minutes
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.680]   and then it came up on the pod for 20 seconds.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.520]   So then some internet theorist basically clipped it and try to,
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.080]   accuse us of organizing a pump and dump.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.840]   Well, obviously if you're talking about selling something,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.560]   it's not a pump.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.360]   It's also not a dump either.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.400]   So anyway, the reason why we said cut it out last week
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.200]   is because we didn't want to give oxygen to this stupid,
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.840]   like conspiracy theory that somebody had invented
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.440]   on the internet with like no basis whatsoever,
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.440]   because you could spend all day trying to like shoot
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.280]   this stuff down.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.480]   But then at the Solana conference,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.360]   enough told me, enough people told me that this was
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.760]   becoming a meme that I thought was worth addressing.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.800]   And what, and look,
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.080]   you have to understand with crypto is that for every cryptocurrency
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.120]   like Solana, there are haters because they're invested in.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.160]   It's very tribal.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.960]   Or Cardano or whatever.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.240]   Everybody's talking up their books.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.560]   There are pump and dumps and there are armies of anonymous
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.880]   Twitter accounts that will coordinate attacks and or memes, etc.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.200]   Right.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.480]   So they're trying to spread the rumor that like VCs are big holders
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.000]   in Solana and are going to dump it.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.200]   The reality is that Multicoin
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.440]   has a large position, but they have LPs.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.680]   They are slowly distributing their positions to LPs.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.160]   In the forms of the tokens.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.560]   They're not selling them and giving you cash.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.520]   They're giving you the tokens.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.640]   You get to decide what you do.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:34.960]   Yes.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.680]   And by the way, that's what we'd like to do as well.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.720]   We're currently working through those mechanics because it's actually
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.440]   complicated for a VC firm to distribute in kind through tokens.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.960]   But if you had to give them to your LPs subsequently.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.160]   That's what I would like to do.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.720]   Exactly.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.240]   So people are doing that with Coinbase.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.720]   So Coinbase is providing that as a service now, from my understanding.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.040]   Right.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.320]   So we have to work through with our LPs, but that's what we're going to try to do
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.640]   is distribute it in kind so everyone can make their own decision.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.360]   I have a couple of things to say.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.520]   So I've only been a buyer.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.280]   I've never, I haven't sold a single Solana token.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:15.360]   And so we are net buyers and we're buying a bunch of stuff.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.760]   But I hate acknowledging that.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.880]   And this is why my tone was more noncommittal.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:30.560]   When we did the pod is that I really don't like this culture that's emerged via Twitter mostly,
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:37.760]   where you all of a sudden have to be this maximalist that basically falls on their sword
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.960]   and never sells in order to be legitimate. And I think that that's a really dangerous place to be.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.560]   So, you know, look, if I take a much, much-
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.600]   Why is that dangerous?
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   Well, if I take a much, much bigger step back, let me put Solana in the context of crypto and let me
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.720]   put crypto in the context of crypto. And I think that's a really dangerous place to be. So, you know, look, if I take a much, much-
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.680]   I think that's a really dangerous place to be. So, you know, look, if I take a much, much bigger step back, let me put Solana in the context of crypto and let me put Solana in the context of crypto.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:02.240]   And where we are today at the end of the week, after Q3 earnings in November of 2021, we have
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.600]   the stock market at absolute all-time highs.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.120]   Ripping.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.920]   We have crypto at absolute all-time highs.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.960]   Ripping.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.560]   We have the art markets. I don't know if you guys saw Phillips and Christie's and Sotheby's this
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.360]   past week at absolute all-time highs.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   Sold another people for 25 million.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.560]   We have inflation at a 30-year high. We have
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.600]   10-year break-evens at a 25-year high. We have, you know, one point some odd trillion dollars that
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.760]   we just approved last week and we're still horse trading on another three, you know,
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:40.640]   $1.8 trillion of stimulus that we're going to put in. And so when you, and then you have, and I think
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.800]   the most important thing, which is the two most important founders of our generation, the two
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.400]   smartest people who have really consistently won, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, have collectively sold more than 11 billion dollars.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.800]   of their holdings this year alone.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:01.120]   And if you can't take all of that and decide for yourself, what's right for you and your family,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.760]   you're doing yourself a disservice. I think it's important for me to never sort of like,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.920]   you know, be forced to tell folks whether I'm buying or selling, although I'm willing to do
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.600]   it in moments where I think it's important. But I think it's really important to understand the
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.320]   context. And so I think like these folks that like think derisively about individuals who are
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.240]   managing risk, I think it's really nice to be able to say, you know, I'm going to buy this stock.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.040]   I'm going to buy this stock. I'm going to buy this stock. I'm going to buy this stock. I'm going to buy this stock.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.800]   And I think it's, it creates a lot of missed opportunity for them as well. If the smartest
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:35.280]   people in the world are now selling their core holdings that they told you they would never sell,
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:43.600]   and you are not reconsidering your position on things, you're either much smarter than them,
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.320]   or you're being really, really reckless.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.760]   All right, there you have it.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.880]   All right. We usually people also know inside baseball, we have a docket of stories that we
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   talk about on our group chat that make up the docket for the show. But I'll bring stuff up.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.440]   And I didn't bring that up in some way to cause trouble or anything. I thought you guys would
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.520]   want to clear the air about it. And I understand your position of, hey, you don't want to give
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.680]   these things oxygen or whatever. But I think I didn't even know that we needed to clear the
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   air until you know, I went to the conference and enough people mentioned it. So but what's
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.920]   so funny is half the people on Twitter spend all their time in crypto land saying things like,
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.840]   never going to make it have fun staying poor. They're extremely Jason, as you said, tribal.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.880]   I'm not sure that they're doing first principles analysis of these things.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.840]   They're toxic.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.680]   They've got exceptionally lucky.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.000]   Some of them are exceptionally good. But many people broadly speaking,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.080]   have gotten exceptionally lucky. And I think a little bit of it is getting to their head where
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.600]   they become, you know, very virulent against people that they think, you know, whose perspectives may
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.280]   actually be negatively affecting their position without actually understanding what David said,
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.520]   that they're not going to be able to do anything about it.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:01.840]   Yeah, I mean, I think that's a really good point. I mean, I'd like to give my opinion on Solana. But
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.920]   the thing or just crypto in general, the thing that's like hard about it is that it's hard to
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.720]   talk about the benefits of say, the Solana blockchain without being seen as a pumper
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.360]   of soul or a dumper of ether, whatever, because all these things are so intrinsically connected.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.600]   I mean, I learned a lot of really bullish things about Solana, you know, at this conference. I mean,
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.920]   I think the biggest thing is, I mean, there's basically a battle for the hearts and minds of
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.600]   developers going on right now between Solana and Ethereum. That's why Solana has raced up to,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.200]   you know, over 200. I don't know what, like 7000% increase or something incredible like that.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.000]   The reason is because Solana as a blockchain gives confirmations back in something like 400
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.920]   milliseconds, whereas Ethereum takes, you know, minutes, and you know, transaction that might cost
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.440]   10s of dollars, 10, 20, 30, $50 of gas on Ethereum.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.160]   It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:52.800]   money. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.600]   It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.720]   It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   Yeah, exactly. It's also, you know, a lot of developers feel like the tools,
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.880]   the developer tools that they've created are easier than building on solidity.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.160]   The thing that Solana gives up, the trade off that it makes is decentralization. There's basically
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:15.920]   that transactions are processed by 20 validators, and they're a top 20 based on holdings of soul.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.400]   So it's kind of like this proof of stake model. So anyway, there's some trade offs there. I can tell
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   you that, you know, it's a view of, you know, our friends at multi coin. And you know, I heard a lot
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.760]   of this views at the conference, although obviously, you have taken with a grain of salt,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.440]   because these are the biggest believers, but their view is that Solana over the next year will flip
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.920]   Ethereum based on developer activity that there's real, to your point, we spend a lot of time,
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.760]   actually, before we do anything is that's the only thing we've been looking at, you know, and
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.880]   we're kind of like, I'm going to do this. And then we're like, I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.040]   And then we're like, I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. And then we're like, I'm going to do that.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:54.720]   syndica fractal, a lot of the stuff that we've done DSO is purely driven by developer interest.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.120]   When we see developers in the open source ecosystem building things on top of this stuff,
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.040]   making stuff that's composable and usable by other people and building infrastructure.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.920]   You know, we don't really second guess that because they are spending their
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.640]   the most important currency, which is not monetary capital, but human capital.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.600]   Yeah, their time, their skill time and their skill and reputation.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.800]   Another project. Yeah.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.600]   And so when enough developers so I've always thought you just follow the developers. And as
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.880]   more and more projects get started, you just have to unemotionally support that I think the writing
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:33.120]   is on the wall, which is Bitcoin is gold, Ethereum looks like it's trending to be silver. And Solana
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.240]   could be the first but there will be others that come after it, of real developer ecosystems that
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.240]   can be built on top of it. The other the other thing that I would offer up to people for them
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.440]   to think about is before you blindly go and write a book, you're going to have to think about what
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.400]   you're going to do. You're going to have to think about what you're going to do. You're going to have
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:46.880]   to think about what you're going to do. I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.520]   really important. I think it's really important to think about what you're going to do. And so,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.640]   one way in which I try to think about these things is in the following way, you see these projects
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:59.680]   get started all the time. And I would view each of these projects as a mini economy, and really try
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.480]   to think what is the economic value of what's happening under the hood. So simple example, you
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.720]   know, helium is an interesting project that's trying to build a completely decentralized, you
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:14.160]   know, 5g infrastructure, right? render is a really interesting project that's trying to build a
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.040]   completely decentralized, you know, graphical processing infrastructure, right GPUs, essentially.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:25.840]   In both of those things, you can quantifiably economically measure what the value is that
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:33.760]   people get right in the case of render, you're basically displacing an AWS instance. And so that
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.480]   has a price and a value. And so you know, for render to be valuable, there's an economic value
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:44.080]   that it replaces. If you're joining a hotspot that has an economic value where you had necessarily
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.120]   have to pay,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.040]   you know, to get internet connectivity, if you all of a sudden are on the helium network,
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.800]   that displaces a measurable economic quantum. Understanding that is probably and taking the
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.200]   absolute value of that is the best way of really understanding which projects have potential. So if
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.160]   you take those two ideas and marry them together, where is their developer interest? And where is
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.840]   their measurable economic activity at the intersection of those I think are the really
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.480]   compelling projects that can win. Well, the thing that complicates
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.960]   all of this is that the developers are not just picking based on which language or technology,
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:20.800]   or stack they think has the most potential. They also have acquired economic stakes in it. So a
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.240]   developer who might be objective and say, hey, this new platform is better than Ethereum, might
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.920]   be sitting on millions of dollars in Ethereum. And they're like, I want to keep my bet going here.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.560]   And I'm going to keep talking my book,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.080]   possibly, but I but I do think that developers in general will choose the platform that's easiest
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.040]   and cheapest and fastest for them to develop on,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.800]   which would mean the list on
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.840]   coin market cap of market cap ones that has been static for a decade of crypto almost,
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.520]   you know, we're largely the top 10 doesn't change that much. It's XRP, it's stellar,
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.400]   Ethereum, Bitcoin, tether, that could be up for grabs, that whole thing could change now that
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.280]   people are actually building projects, and the projects are getting competitive with each other.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.440]   And that's that flippening we're talking about, correct sex?
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.000]   Yeah, I think that what's tricky here,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.640]   again, is I never want to give anyone investment advice. I mean, that's just not my job. And
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.640]   if there's anyone out there listening to the show, because they're trying to get like tips or tricks,
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.880]   whatever for investment, like I'm not really comfortable telling people what to do.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.680]   Sure.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.200]   So you know, everyone just has to understand that I did, I do feel like what I saw at this
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.440]   conference over the past week in terms of developer enthusiasm activity was very bullish,
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.960]   actually, it was a lot like I went to the Ethereum conference, I think it was back in 2017, several
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.920]   years ago, and it felt a little bit like that. Although I would say that this time, it felt less
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.480]   academic.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.320]   Like several years ago, it felt more like white papers. Now it actually feels like
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.640]   real projects and businesses that people are trying to create.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.680]   Still infrastructure and less applications or more applications?
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.200]   Well, Chamath mentioned a couple of them. So there's Helium, which is creating a decentralized
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.400]   network for Wi Fi. There's Render, which is creating a decentralized network for GPU. There's
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.360]   one called Hivemapper, I met the founder. It's a decentralized network for people to map the world,
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.680]   you can think of, you know, the concept of a miner that Bitcoin invented, think of them more as like
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.320]   a resource.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:21.200]   So, you know, we call them miners, but they're the validators of transactions. And we're trying to
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.640]   incentivize them through block rewards, basically through small bits of Bitcoin that get released,
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:33.120]   to provide these valuable computing resources to the network. And so people are figuring out now,
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.160]   how to create massively decentralized networks where you have, you know,
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.240]   1000s or millions of resource providers provide a little bit of something to the
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.160]   network for everyone's benefit in exchange, they get some coin. That's like a really interesting
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.640]   model that couldn't exist before crypto. And so yeah, I mean, I think it's very interesting. But
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.160]   you know, in order for that to work, you have to have, like very unique, fast, efficient, scalable
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:02.960]   blockchains. And the feeling as I mean, I'll give credit here to to Tushar, who's one of the
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:09.200]   GPs at Multicoin. His view is that this was the iPhone moment for blockchain that that what Solana
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.000]   has built because it's massively scalable, and also very cheap. I mean, again, you can run a lot of
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.280]   transactions for pennies. Now, all of that is obviously very bullish for Solana. The thing I
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.360]   wrestle with is, and Chamath kind of alluded to this is I think everything's kind of in a bubble
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.760]   right now because of monetary and fiscal policy. And so you know, I guess I, you could say that
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.520]   I'm long Solana versus ETH. But I do kind of worry that the whole world right now is very bubbly.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.360]   And so as a GP, like, what do you do about that? I can tell you right now,
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.840]   like this second, we are sitting on Solana that we have not sold. So
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.720]   you know, I am long in that sense. However, sometime over the next whatever number of years,
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.840]   we will distribute out our position of Solana to LPs.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.440]   And then the LPs will make their decisions.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.720]   And then they will make their decisions.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.880]   Some LPs might specialize in crypto and want to keep it. Other ones might not want to hold assets
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.880]   and need that money to fund their endowment to give scholarships to students, or whatever your
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.400]   LPs particularly do. Well, yeah, I mean, and so I guess, to the issue of, hey,
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.680]   we're not giving investment advice here. We are all capital allocators and startup creators.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:19.040]   So we're talking about our day to day lives here. Nobody should interpret this as investment advice.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.840]   And especially not in a world now. I don't know if you guys saw what happened with Rivian this week.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:30.480]   I don't know how we don't talk about a company with essentially no public sales. They've sold
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:38.560]   148 cars to their employees is worth $120 billion. Any free bird? Did you see this IPO? Any thoughts
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.120]   on it? Seems like a high level, do you have investment advice for the audience that you'd
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.520]   like to give?
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.280]   Tell me what Rivian does.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.720]   Wait, can you play that video that you found that you shared with everyone?
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.080]   You have that video? You know?
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.360]   Okay, well, I we do have it. I can we queue it up. Did you see this yet?
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.160]   So is this guy?
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.480]   No, I haven't. Oh, that Yeah, well, but just so I don't want to beat this point to death. But I
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.680]   just think it's so important for the audience that what they should be getting out of the show,
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:10.080]   if they're fans is maybe like advice on how to think critical thinking and how we think about
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.520]   investments. Not principles.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.360]   Tips. Exactly. So look,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.400]   if you want to invest in crypto, first of all, like go understand like what all these different
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.520]   projects or blockchains do and figure out what is the purpose of the token in that system? What are
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.960]   the token economics? Yeah, does it even make sense? Or is it just a scam? Then if it's a if
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.240]   it's something like a blockchain, go research how many projects are have developers on them
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.360]   and how much code is being checked in, and maybe open a wallet and buy some NFTs and buy some ETH
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.200]   and transfer it and learn just how to set up your internet connection.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.240]   Right, right.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.840]   This was 1995.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.000]   Right, exactly. And then on top of all that, you got to consider macro forces because I mean,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.720]   and I think, you know, my friends at multi coin would fully concede this, that, you know,
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.760]   it could be the case that if there's a crypto bust over the next year, and this thing, you know,
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.160]   crypto has gone through boom and bust cycles for many, many years.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.520]   That is the standard.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.400]   It's the standard. So you could have a situation in which, for example, Solana flips ETH and yet
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   still goes down in value, because there's an overall bust cycle. So you know, you have to
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.040]   consider the macro forces.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.280]   macroeconomic factors as well. So there's a lot of things to consider here. And then you also have
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.400]   to consider your own risk tolerance. And you know, what is appropriate for your portfolio? And it may
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:22.800]   be different than us.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.880]   When do you need your money? Are you a 25 year old?
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.280]   Everything is at all time highs, and the two smartest men in the world are selling.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.720]   Not just not just them, by the way. There are other guys that are heavily on the other side
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.560]   waiting for this whole thing to go. Like Druckenmiller has been very vocal about this.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.880]   And he's, he's been the best macro trader in the last 30 years.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.000]   So his position is what exactly?
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.560]   That we're printing too much money, and we're in a lot of trouble. So you know,
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.280]   look, I mean, generally, there is, I think a good point of view being shared here,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.600]   which is, you know, understanding how to think about what you're investing in and what your,
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:07.360]   your expectations are, versus relying on someone's advice or opinion on what to do. If you have to
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.760]   rely on someone else's advice or opinion on what to do, you're gonna eventually lose money.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.720]   You should not be.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.920]   In that investment.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.680]   You should not be in the market, because guess what, anyone that's giving you advice or opinions
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.280]   is going to make money if you do what they tell you to do, if you do what they tell you to do.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:26.480]   End of story. So at some point, they're gonna all make money and you're gonna end up losing money.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.800]   And it's a it's, you know, it's, it's, it's a better game to play,
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.720]   to learn how to kind of be thoughtful about where's your money going? What are you investing
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.600]   in? And it takes a lot of time and a lot of money. I've been sitting here silently,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.560]   as you guys have been talking deeply about Solana and Ethereum and Bitcoin and,
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:48.960]   and the crypto markets because I realized so much of, you know, what's needed to be successful
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.680]   in entering this market is a depth of understanding a depth of knowledge, my time is highly limited,
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.960]   I have spent no time understanding crypto markets, because it's so deep, and it's so fluid,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.120]   it's changing every day, it's changing every week. So if I can't get smart enough to feel
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.720]   confident about the opinions and decisions that I would be making as an investor,
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.480]   I decide not to invest and I stay out. And so I'm not an active crypto investor,
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.400]   you're a specialist, and you're
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.160]   on the razor's edge on synthetic biology and so many other
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   whatever it is, there are other areas where it's better for me to spend my time and my energy. And
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:25.360]   I've chosen to do that versus being drawn into what feels like a very exciting, kind of, you
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.680]   know, turbulent time. There are other areas that I kind of spend my time on. And I just kind of try
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   to recognize that maybe I don't know what I'm doing if I were to try and get involved here.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.600]   And so I'd rather stay out. And I think that's counsel for for anyone, you know, if you're going
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.760]   to make an investment, it's important to feel confident about the knowledge and the depth needed
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.240]   to kind of be
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.200]   different.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:50.880]   I'll build on your point, like when I when I started doing my specs, I started to write
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.200]   these one pagers. And those one pages were artifacts for me to hold myself accountable for
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.360]   how I saw something in a moment in time, and then to be able to see whether it was
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:05.760]   tracking to that, and then also to share it to other people a starting point,
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.360]   as David said, a journey where they should then if they're curious, go and do their own work.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.080]   It turned out not enough people were doing the work. So then I had to
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.640]   start adding disclaimers to these things saying, Hey, guys, I'm not telling you to buy this,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:23.840]   please be abundantly clear. These next facts that I will eventually launch, you're going to see
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:30.480]   an entire like in red block letters, like please don't buy this. Right? Because to your point,
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.600]   it doesn't matter what you say people want a lazy, easy way out. And so I just want to reiterate
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:41.360]   what all of you guys said none of us are dispensing advice, we are not telling you to do anything.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:47.280]   Please do your own work. And please come to your conclusion. It is your responsibility. And if
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.840]   you're not sure go and look at your children in the face or your significant other in the face,
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.720]   you're responsible to them. And so do your own work.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:06.240]   I'll say one more point on where I sit as an investor. I choose to only participate
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.760]   in investing in what I call productive assets. That is you put some money into something and
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.560]   whatever that thing is, is generating money in some way or is trying to generate value through
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:23.280]   a set of activities, like a business, or owning an apartment building where you're making rent,
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.120]   you know, anything that or you know, a group of people that are trying to have some breakthrough
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.960]   or some discovery. Those are productive assets. There's a lot of what's going on now. That is
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.520]   what I would call speculative assets, which is the only way you make money is if someone else pays
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.600]   more in the future versus what you're paying. And there isn't
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.280]   an underlying productive asset to what you're putting money into.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.680]   You're describing every ICO or shitcoin.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:53.680]   Every ICO, every NFT and the art market, right? These are examples of unproductive assets.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.720]   They're speculative assets in the sense that you're speculating that at some point,
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.560]   the price of them are going to go up and someone
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.040]   Somebody wants that NFT more than you.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.280]   Someone down the road will pay more for that asset than what you paid. But that underlying asset,
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.560]   that capital that you just put in, didn't go in to build something.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.440]   There's no revenue generation, there's no IP.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.440]   It went into someone else's pocket that sold that asset to you. And you're eventually going
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:21.200]   to try and sell it to someone else. And so, there's a real attraction here. Because what
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.960]   we just talked about is really hard to do. Having fundamental analysis and understanding of
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.960]   businesses and a fundamental understanding of what's working and what's not and when to shift
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.600]   and oh my gosh, are things different or are they not? To do that is really hard.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.680]   So people end up relying on opinions of others, or they end up running into
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.280]   speculative markets. And the speculative markets are easy to understand. Someone
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.200]   just paid more for X than the other person did. Therefore, there's a trend line, it's going up.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.600]   It's like playing roulette. And black keeps coming up and you're like, okay, it's going to be black
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:49.840]   again.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.280]   It has to be black. There were seven, correct?
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.880]   There were seven blacks. And so, I think that that's a really important takeaway
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.920]   for folks that might be new as investors.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.120]   We're all susceptible. We're all susceptible to this. I was just looking
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:10.640]   at my own performance coming into the end of this year. And I did a lot of SPACs this year, but I
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.400]   did these pipes, which are these third-party deals.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.160]   Private investment in public entities.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.920]   Exactly. Other people's deals that they were bringing to the market where they said,
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:25.360]   Chamath, do you want to be a part of it? And I did. And part of it was I was
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:32.400]   looking at these things and, you know, Freeberg doing my work. But in the end,
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.800]   it turned out I didn't do nearly as much as I probably should have because I ended up
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.960]   sitting on top of other people's work versus the original or underwriting that I would do if it was
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:46.640]   my own deal itself. Right? Anyways, the net of it all is like, you know, that was very inefficient
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   capital deployment. And as I look at it now, it's like, you know, I'm down. Well, I'm technically up
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.640]   19%, but that's really because of one deal. If I take that one deal out, which was a total outlier,
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.280]   I'm down 17% on about $200 million of investment.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.040]   When you were a fast follower, not the originator, it wasn't your idea. This is
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.800]   critically important. There are many different ways to make money, but you have to specialize
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.040]   and you have to have first principles and your knowledge.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.800]   I didn't. I trusted other
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.200]   people. I did the same thing that I that I'm saying to other people not to do do not just
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.360]   copy other people, you have to do your own principle work. And even when you do your own
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.920]   principle work, it may not be enough. And you have to be willing to basically see the forest from the
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.080]   trees and walk away. And so all these pipes, I'm in the midst of sort of cleaning up and selling
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.200]   down. And they've been a just a kind of a disaster for me. You know, I hold on, I want to build on
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.880]   this for a second, because I think it's critically important what you said as well, Friedberg,
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.640]   you have to be comfortable with the investment you're making. I look at these companies and I look at the
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.120]   underlying customer, the product, you know, and what kind of revenue it's going to generate. And
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.040]   people thought I was dunking on Rivian yesterday. And I said, Listen, you know, when Tesla went
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:55.600]   public, people forget their valuation was 1.5 billion 1.7. So 1.7 billion, when they went
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:02.880]   public. Now, they already had 1000s of roadsters, and they had already had the 93 93 million of
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:08.960]   revenue in year one. So this was dramatically different than what Rivian had Rivian is being
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.480]   valued at, you know, whatever that is.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.880]   120 billion, I think yesterday, Rivian has 17 billion cash, somebody asked me at the poker
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:22.960]   game last night, what I value Rivian at, I said, 17 plus 317 million in cash plus 3 billion,
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.360]   double roughly what Tesla's was the market's hotter right now, whatever. But I put them at
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.760]   20 billion. And people were giving a hard time about I said, I think that's actually
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.800]   the realistic valuation for this company. And we are in a very dangerous moment in time right
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.320]   now where I think people are whether it's meme stocks, or crypto, or NF T's, suspending
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.480]   disbelief, in some cases, SPACs, because they're not all created equal. And certainly in private
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.760]   companies, we're seeing this, where people are giving people an amount of credit, which makes
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:55.040]   no logical sense, and is getting further and further disconnected in from reality. So as an
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.400]   investor, you have a choice, either you take you have your fundamentals, which I'm not going to
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.080]   change my fundamentals, I'm going to focus on the fundamentals that got me where I am.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.960]   And I'm not going to be involved in $100 billion market cap company
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.160]   that hasn't launched a product yet, let alone $120 billion,
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.480]   or $100 billion, I'll stay focused on startups. But what you're saying is also important,
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:20.880]   because you're highlighting how you value that company, you individually said, I think that
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:26.160]   company's worth some multiple of how many cars have been sold in the past, Elon sold, you know,
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.640]   1000s of cars, he was worth 1.7 billion, these guys have sold, and other people are coming in
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.720]   and looking at this company and saying they've built facilities, they've built assembly lines,
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.480]   and they've got pre orders and bookings for lots and lots of cars down in the future.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.000]   And clearly, they've gone in and you know, some
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.200]   people have gone in and seen these plants and seen these cars actually working.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.840]   So you know, it's really important to take note that your point of view is one point of view in
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.680]   a very diverse market with many points of view. And everyone's going to come into this market.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.320]   And that's why unless you individually as an investor, have a strong point of view and can
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:01.920]   show that you can apply your unique insights to consistently beat the market making decisions,
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.520]   investment decisions like that you're eventually going to lose because those other points of view
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.840]   will be a bigger view of the truth and you'll lose money. And that's why I said that and that's by
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.440]   the way, that's why picking stocks is ultimately a loser's game unless you have some unique ability
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:20.080]   and insight for most people historically and in an upmarket everyone, everyone looks like a genius.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.120]   Right, you need to have an edge and the public markets are hard to say that there's some
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.240]   there's some competency. Yeah, there's some unique competency that you need.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.080]   I mean, if we double click on what you just said as the things that would be reasons to
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.800]   embed on Rivian, number one, they have 48,000 orders of pickup trucks
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:39.680]   against the F 150, which is now electric from Ford and a million.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.200]   I don't know why you're arguing this, right? Like you're just making a point that we don't
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.240]   have someone on the on the on the panel right now, but someone else could come in and argue.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.320]   And I would just say, this is the part of the conversation to be honest, Jason,
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:57.520]   to give you feedback I don't like because Rivian, just in defense of Rivian for a second.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:03.600]   What I have heard is that it's a it's a well engineered car or truck rather,
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:09.520]   they've done a very smart path to market, which is essentially to, you know,
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.040]   build these delivery trucks for Amazon that allowed them to even frankly,
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.360]   you know, be default alive. Sure, versus, you know, to use the Paul Graham term instead of
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:23.200]   default dead. I think the point that's more important here is that it doesn't affect you.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:28.240]   So let Rivian do well, you know, and this is part of the cycle.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.120]   You shouldn't have an opinion publicly. No, no, no, I'm just saying this is the
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:37.840]   part of the cycle that I don't understand where people legitimately have these
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.840]   zero sum points of view about companies. And this is where I think, Freiburg is more right than
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:51.040]   anybody else, which is there are the market is the sum of all these collective points of view.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.320]   Sure. And I think it's fine. I think it's fine to have one.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.240]   I think it's a little superficial your point of view, because it's not really
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.280]   sitting on top of a model or anything else. And I think it's the same kind of superficiality that
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:09.200]   the Tesla cute guys had about Tesla for many years as well. It takes a long time as somebody that
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.600]   does this every day. And I just want to point this out, it takes an enormous amount of time,
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:18.720]   an enormous amount of work to be 55% right. Listen, I've invested in 350 companies,
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.880]   I meet with 2000 companies a year. No, in the public markets, Jason,
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.880]   it's different in the public markets. Listen, my companies are going public now,
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.560]   so I take exception to what you're saying. I know a fraud when I see it. I've seen them before.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.320]   Oh, that's a really big statement. I'm not saying Rivian's that fraud level yet.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.760]   That's not a fraud. No, but the distance between the
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.600]   valuation and reality is in the 50 to 100 billion dollar range.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.040]   Okay, but that's it. I know, but that's not in control of Rivian. That's not in their control.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.160]   Okay, that's in a bunch of external market participants control. So you can't pin that
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.400]   on them. My point is, pin it on is at the market right now seems dysfunctional,
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:55.440]   but Jason properly measuring throwing shade that you then you should throw shade at T row fidelity,
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.480]   all these people that are bidding up your companies, by the way, because they are the ones
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.040]   that are taking Rivian to 120 billion. It's not Rivian's fault. And Jason, what's really going on
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:08.160]   in the market was public speculators. What's really going on is not you can't sell $16 billion
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:15.600]   in an IPO to speculators. This is much lower price. These are institutionally placed
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:20.560]   trade orders. But regardless, the market is clearly right now in productive assets,
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:25.680]   businesses, the market is looking at a time horizon that has never looked at before,
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.640]   which is making bets that are 10 1520 years in the future. And that's because of the condition
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.400]   that we're in right now from a monetary policy point of view, interest rates are so low,
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.720]   there's nowhere to get yield in other assets. So you have to look further and further out to find
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:44.160]   value. The market is betting is making 10 year bets, which is like a VC type more than a 10 year
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.720]   bet. Jason, sorry, I can I just can I just finish my last point because before you interrupt me.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:55.040]   My issue, Jason is I think you are an exceptional angel investor. But just the same way you derided
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.760]   a bunch of late stage guys remember last night at poker, when we were talking about late stage folks
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:05.600]   entering into the angel market, and the series A you were extremely dismissive because you know
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.560]   what the job is to be done to do that.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.640]   job well, and they have a different skill set. Similarly, what I would just offer for you to
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:18.480]   think about is the people that really underwrite public market stocks well, do things and have a
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.920]   skill set that is extremely specific, and it is well trained as well. And I think that
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.920]   Okay, no, I accept that.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.320]   I'll defend me. Let me jump into the jake house.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.880]   If you want to defend me, and that's the people are in shock right now. So
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.440]   way to get yourself back in the game.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.200]   This guy is purple. This guy is purple. The moon is set.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   Hell is freezing over right now.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.360]   Hell is freezing over.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.040]   Okay. So here's where I think Jake, I don't know anything about the Rivian company. But where I
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:51.360]   think Jake is right is we've seen over and over again, that when a company gets when a startup
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:57.840]   gets a billion dollar plus valuation without a product, invariably, it ends up somewhere between
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:06.240]   a disappointment and outright fraud, whether you know, it was Theranos or magic leap or Quibi,
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   or whatever. I'm not saying they're all fraud.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:16.320]   I mean, I think just Theranos fraud, whatever. So I think it's reasonable for any, let's say seed or
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.680]   early venture investor to develop the heuristic, that I'm not going to invest in anything with a
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:26.320]   billion dollar with basically unicorn valuation without seeing the product first, because we've
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:32.080]   learned we've got our hands burnt so many times from these overhyped companies. And here's where
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.880]   I agree if I can't see and use the product, I'm not investing. I'll invest in a seed stage, but
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.080]   I will not invest in a unicorn.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.440]   I agree with that. But what I'm saying is when a company is going public like that, there is
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:48.400]   demonstrable proof of concept there. Okay, the only market in which that's not true is in
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.600]   biotechnology.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.320]   Well, I would say for Fisker and Nikola, two related companies, those ones seem very, very
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.080]   shaky, you can debate about the scalability of these things. And you can debate that people
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.640]   didn't do the diligence, but they had to at least put a proof of concept out there for you to judge.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.320]   If people don't do the work, I agree with you, like if you're rolling down a hill, sure.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.400]   I agree with you. But if you're rolling down a hill, sure.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.680]   No, but my point is, if you were there, and you did your work, you would have seen what you needed
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.960]   to see. What I have heard from people who were investors in both Lucid and Rivian, is that they
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.360]   have sat in the cars, they've driven the cars, they've spent time with them, they've seen the
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:27.840]   factories. And it's very much real. Now what they're debating is ramp and velocity and scale.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   I don't know. I don't have a position in either.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.480]   Neither do I.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.000]   I have the bigger macro point of view, which is important to me, which is
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.760]   just because these things are in the public markets, I think
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.080]   people think it's easy to judge. And I think actually modeling them and making good decisions
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.840]   is just as hard as it is for private companies.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.480]   We need to roll this clip because there is somebody who is giving
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.520]   exceptional advice on CNBC. Let's roll the clip.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:56.320]   Yeah, so well up starts up about 25% just in four days since we since we bought it,
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.840]   we bought it on about four days ago. So that's actually made a nice little move in the short
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:07.120]   term, probably a little extended right now, but longer term, that that's a that's a good looking
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:07.600]   name.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.800]   A very powerful, very strong earnings. These stocks are
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.720]   they do. What do they do?
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.280]   Excuse me?
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.240]   What does upstart do?
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.360]   Well, I'm
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.480]   what kind of company is it?
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.040]   Yeah, I'm not you're breaking up.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:29.200]   Oh, I guess we've got an audio problem. I'm sorry.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.800]   Brutal.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.440]   Who is this guy? Who is he?
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.240]   I have no idea.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.440]   Jake, how is that? Is that like your uncle or something? Who is that guy?
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.120]   Yeah, I mean, just to the point to get on CNBC.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:45.040]   Well, you know, the guy's been on many times.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.160]   But doesn't this prove what we were saying, which is that you've got to do your own
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.800]   principal work here. That is why we wanted to play.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.560]   Here's a talking head who's probably getting paid for selling some books and giving advice.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.480]   Who knows nothing about what he's telling you.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.280]   You can join his membership club for 1000 a month.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.120]   I'm sure he's publishing lots of papers that show that he's a highly successful,
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.280]   profitable investor and look how smart he is. He doesn't even know the company just promoted.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.640]   On CNBC. It's incredible.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:14.080]   On a mechanical basis here, Chamath, you and I have been on CNBC many times.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:21.520]   In that moment, what is going on? What do you think is going on in the host's mind?
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.360]   And the producer who has to dump this call?
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:25.920]   Let's move on.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.800]   They're watching this.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.680]   Let's move on.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.160]   I just the breakdown when he says, I'm sorry.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.440]   I have no idea.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.320]   What do they do?
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.480]   I think the point's been made. I think the point's been made.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.600]   Oh, my Lord.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.800]   Everybody should do their own work.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.920]   Do your work.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.840]   Let's keep going.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.600]   Zach, you look like you want to say something.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.320]   I mean, it just shows the agenda.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.800]   Yeah, look, I mean, there is a massive agenda in corporate journalism.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.560]   There's an agenda by the people on these shows to promote positions.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:57.200]   There's an agenda by the reporters themselves and on and on and on it goes.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.400]   So to Chamath's point, if you just take them at face value,
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.800]   and you don't do your own work, then you're buying into someone else's agenda.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.080]   Trust yourself.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.320]   Okay.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.560]   One thing that we are trying to all understand is inflation.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:19.440]   The CPI has gone up 6.2% in October, the highest jump in 31 years since 1990.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.840]   According to the Wall Street Journal, fifth largest straight month,
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.880]   fifth straight month of inflation above 5%.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.040]   Somebody tweeted out, we'll pull it up here.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:35.280]   Denver Bitcoin put out a year over year commodity chart, we can throw up on the screen.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.800]   And then,
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:42.400]   I think, Friedberg, you shared in the chat, the average weekly retail prices
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.800]   around fertilizer.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:53.840]   What are our thoughts on the nature of inflation and how that affects our investment?
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.120]   I think it's persistent.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.440]   It's persistent.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:01.360]   And the reason I think it's persistent is that all of these things are intertwined.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.920]   And so, you know, if you want to just bear with me for a second, like when this let's just go to the,
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.040]   the entry level economic job, right?
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:14.080]   So you're a barista at Starbucks, or you work at McDonald's, and you're making 17 to $20 an hour.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.040]   What that does is it shifts labor.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:22.080]   And eventually, there are other people that are entering the workforce or, you know, may shift
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:22.480]   jobs.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:27.760]   And essentially, it just causes this leaky bucket effect where everybody else has to then accommodate
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.080]   itself.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.880]   So you know, you have a guy like, you know, you have a company like Amazon, which is now going
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.760]   to pay 25 or $30 to keep folks, right?
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:40.000]   Because otherwise, they may say, Oh, you know, if I make 15 or $16 an hour, I'd rather work at
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.360]   McDonald's, it's simply college, it's not backbreaking work, blah, blah, blah.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.160]   So then they start to increase the amount that they pay, they increase their benefits and the
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:48.400]   like.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:54.560]   I saw this thing this week, there's a crazy thing that's happening, though, which is it's now
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:44:01.040]   pulling people from non traditional job classes into those jobs, there are teachers that are
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.600]   leaving teaching to go work at an Amazon warehouse, there are firefighters, that are going to go work
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.160]   at an Amazon warehouse, there are people that are quitting being a firefighter to go work at an
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.840]   Amazon warehouse, because you make the same or more.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.960]   Plus, you have all of these other benefits, and the job is structurally a lot easier.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.600]   And so people are making different optimizations.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.000]   And to that point, I think we talked about this, and Nick, you can put it in the group chat.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:34.160]   In Reddit, as an example, there is more engagement in the subreddit around having a simple work life
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.440]   than there is now in Wall Street.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.720]   And so I think that's a really good point.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.120]   So there's been a structural cultural change where people need to get paid more to do the
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.000]   same amount of work.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.920]   And then at the same time, you have all of the all of the supply side getting more expensive.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:53.360]   fertilizer makes corn more expensive lumber makes house prices more expensive chip prices makes the
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.880]   iPhone and cars more expensive or completely backlogged.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.320]   You know, yesterday at poker, Sonny was showing us he bought a Tesla.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:05.280]   And the delivery period is October of 2022.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.680]   Yeah, it's freaking crazy.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.000]   So I think that it's a it's this is the beginning of a persistence.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.920]   I think those are all like really valid points.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:20.720]   The thing I'm seeing now is I think we've moved into what I'll call a contagion phase of inflation,
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.280]   which is people are hearing about inflation.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.800]   They're seeing it and some places my guests went up a little bit, my milk went up a little bit,
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.520]   whatever.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.720]   And they're saying, Well, I guess if everybody's raising prices,
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.160]   I need to raise the prices as well of whatever I provide in the world.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.520]   So I can just keep up with everybody else.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.480]   And they're not looking at their inputs necessarily and saying I need to charge more,
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.840]   or that's the best business decision.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.240]   They're just saying, everything's going up around me.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.360]   And so they raise prices.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.680]   I've literally had this happen three or four times.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.800]   And I went to buy a car.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.400]   And they wanted 15k over sticker and I didn't buy it based on principle.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.000]   But I'm sitting here going like, maybe I'm an idiot.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.680]   Maybe I should just pay the 15k over sticker.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.160]   What are your thoughts, Saxon inflation and the contagion?
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.840]   My thoughts are I told you guys like six months ago about this.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.960]   Can we just replay what I said on episode 30?
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.360]   To it's got his researchers in the background.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.600]   Give me written down what you said.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.880]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.880]   No, this guy's in the fucking debate club.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.760]   Stanford debate club.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.320]   Well, some of us when we make predictions, take them seriously.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.960]   So you know, is that a dig at Professor ice cold takes?
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.320]   I'll give you guys a link to a prediction that was made.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.800]   Here's I mean, I just want to replay the 20 seconds.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.320]   I said, Oh, look at you back in May.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:26.800]   Here we go.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.520]   The two Davids dueling again, just like in the group chat.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.360]   Here's Friedberg.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.960]   January 1 2021.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.800]   If you don't think inflation is already here,
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.240]   you missed what happened to the stock market companies aren't performing better.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.200]   We're just inflating everything financial assets first everything also follow.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:41.840]   That was a good one.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.040]   So just make your point.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.000]   Just make your point.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:44.960]   Just add the clip.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.680]   I'm beginning to wonder if Biden's going to be a Jimmy Carter here because,
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:54.240]   frankly, all he had to do was leave things well enough alone.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.600]   COVID was winding down.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.640]   We had a vaccine.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.080]   All they had to do was distribute it to as many people as possible.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.880]   And COVID let the recovery take shape.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.640]   And instead, they push this insane.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.080]   $10 trillion agenda is going to backfire massively.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:12.160]   Look, if the economy turns, we were set for a post COVID boom.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.600]   And right now that is all at risk because, Jamal, like you're saying,
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.120]   they're keeping the economy closed or part parts of it way too long.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.720]   They then overcompensate for that by printing a ton of money.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.680]   And then they overcompensate for that by raising taxes too much.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.880]   Just to build on that.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:34.480]   So that second step of their overcompensating their inability to open with money is so true.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.480]   Because then what happens is your labor force stays
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   impaired because people make enough money by not working.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.040]   It was true.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   And I said in May, it's even more true now.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.040]   He said it was there was inflation.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.080]   Okay, so there's inflation.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.200]   Okay, so now great.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:45.760]   Good job.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   So my prediction is true.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.000]   Yeah, I made one in January that said the same thing.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.320]   Now look, you can do three things to you can do three things to curb inflation.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.760]   Raise rates, right?
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   When you raise interest rates, you slow spending.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.600]   Prices come down.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.800]   Inflation is going to slow down.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.320]   And then you're going to have to do three things.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.120]   You're going to have to do three things.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.320]   You're going to have to do three things.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:04.880]   Prices come down.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.680]   Inflation slows.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.640]   But the issue when you raise rates is obviously you see things like job loss and economic
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.600]   growth declines.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.120]   And it can very quickly spiral the other way.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.120]   This is the big challenge of Fed tapering.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:21.440]   The other option is we've seen a significant attempt at lately is to raise revenue, right?
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:26.400]   So increased tax rates, tax a broader swath of people at a higher rate or broader swath
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.680]   of business at a higher rate.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:34.160]   So it's very likely that tax revenue could kind of present itself again as a driver if
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.320]   inflation continues to spiral up.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.120]   And the third, which is the least likely, is cut spending, right?
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:44.080]   The federal government spending the way it does right now makes a very inefficient way
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.480]   of kind of putting capital into the system and inflating.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.600]   We've seen historically that anything the federal government spends money on, like
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.440]   health care and education, the costs very quickly spiral out of control.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.560]   Super inefficient.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.920]   Why not just give that money to the free market to make decisions on how to spend it?
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.120]   It would be more efficient, etc.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:03.520]   And the market would effectively find balance where buyers and sellers are equivalent as
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.240]   well.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.960]   So that's why I think that the federal government is so important.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.800]   But it's also a really important thing to keep in mind.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.360]   You know, the money is going to be the first thing that comes into the market, right?
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.800]   So that's why it's important to keep in mind.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.320]   And then the second option, which I think is kind of a very important one, is that the
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.280]   federal government is going to be the first one to start a war against the economy.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.840]   And the second option is the one that people don't talk about, which I think may end up
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.680]   becoming an important option, not kind of oblique option, but more kind of backdrop,
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.800]   is to start a war.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.880]   And, you know, when you start a war...
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:38.240]   And I think that's the most important thing, because the policy makers would say, "Hey,
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.640]   let's go start a war to decrease inflation."
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.600]   Taiwan.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:49.200]   But the premise that conflict can improve the economy is an important backdrop that
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.760]   starts to play into policy decisions that might get made over the next couple of months
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.480]   and quarters.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.840]   And that's really important.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:02.240]   Whether or not the posturing is one of partnership and a policy decision, but also of the fact
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.880]   that the government is taking a stand against the economy and the government is taking a stand
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.280]   against the economy, and the government is taking a stand against the economy and the
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.960]   government is taking a stand against the economy.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.720]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.400]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.920]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:16.960]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.240]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.680]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.800]   So I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.960]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.760]   And I think that's the most important thing.

[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:27.520]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.960]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.640]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.760]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.520]   And I think that's the most important thing.

[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.120]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.720]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.480]   And I think that's the most important thing.
