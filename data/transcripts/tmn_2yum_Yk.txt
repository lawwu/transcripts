[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.200]   - Well this summer, you Pastor John finished up a book
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.140]   on the providence of God, a 600 page book
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.640]   coming out in a little over a year from now.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.920]   Really eager to see it, really looking forward
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.400]   to reading it.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.520]   And we talked about it recently
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.800]   in Ask Pastor John episode 1371.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.100]   You can go back and listen to that.
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.640]   Sometimes I say it's a book about the sovereignty of God.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.880]   Sometimes I say it's a book about the providence of God.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.920]   And it leads to a question from Masiel
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.160]   in the Dominican Republic.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.240]   Hello Pastor John, for years I have been blessed
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.720]   by your ministry, your sermons and books especially.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.360]   Thank you for future grace and desiring God.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360]   Likewise, Ask Pastor John has been an instrument
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.920]   to help me know Jesus better.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.680]   I thank God for you and for Tony.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.600]   I was looking for definitions on the sovereignty of God
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.160]   and the providence of God and I couldn't really find
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.480]   one that would make me understand the differences
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.180]   between the two terms.
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.900]   Could you please explain it Pastor John?
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.000]   Are they synonyms or how would you define each
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.200]   of these glorious truths, God's providence
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.880]   and God's sovereignty?
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.960]   - Excellent question and I will answer very specifically
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.760]   in just a moment the very question that was asked.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.400]   But first, it really is important to say a few words
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.520]   about definitions and specifically definitions
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.760]   about words that are not used in the Bible.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.780]   Providence is not a word in the English Bible.
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.060]   In that sense, it's like the words Bible,
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.060]   biblical, trinity, discipleship, evangelism,
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.040]   exposition, counseling, ethics, politics,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.240]   charismatics, none of those words is in the Bible.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.240]   Which shows that the reality that words point to
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.180]   is more important than the words themselves
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.740]   even though the words are precious, indispensable,
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.080]   in this case with the Bible, inspired, God-given.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.660]   They are God's inspired words but they are pointing
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.660]   to reality and that reality may be so woven
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.380]   into the scriptures that it's helpful to have a word
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.880]   that pulls the threads of reality together,
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.700]   a word that may not be in the Bible itself.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.500]   But now what's the implication of that for definitions
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   that I'm being asked for?
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.820]   Well, since providence is not used
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.820]   in specific biblical texts, there's no biblical governor
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.940]   on its definition, its meaning.
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.940]   We can't say the Bible defines providence this way.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.580]   We could only say that if the Bible
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.420]   actually used the word providence.
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.900]   Whenever you ask what does blank mean,
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.980]   what does providence mean, what does justification mean,
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.120]   what does faith mean, whenever you ask
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   what does anything mean, there has to be a meaner,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.360]   one who means, if the meaning is going to have any validity
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.700]   so that you can say it means this and not that.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.700]   So if the meaner is not the Bible writers,
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.000]   then when I use the word providence,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.840]   I must assign a meaning, I'm the meaner.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.160]   And that's what I do in the first chapter
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.640]   of my book on providence.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.960]   I don't assign it an arbitrary meaning.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.520]   I hope if you do that, nobody will understand you.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.880]   You won't be able to have any shared meaning with people
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.920]   because you've chosen a meaning
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.360]   that's just so far off the charts
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.420]   it doesn't make any sense to anybody.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.200]   So I try to stay close to what others,
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   other meaners have meant by the word in church history.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.720]   But I do choose the meaning.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.080]   Now you can see what that implies
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.560]   when we are trying to talk about
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.640]   the biblical view of providence,
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.840]   since the Bible doesn't use the word.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.400]   It implies that the issue before us
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.760]   in those conversations about the meaning of providence,
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.960]   and in my book, the issue before us
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.520]   is not the meaning of the word providence.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.880]   I choose a meaning to use in my book,
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.400]   and I will choose one here because you asked me to.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   The issue is, is the reality which I see in the Bible
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.800]   and call providence really there?
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.620]   That's the issue.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.800]   Let me say it again.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   Is the reality which I see and describe in my book,
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.040]   is the reality which I call providence
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.360]   really there in the Bible?
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.280]   There's no point in quibbling over whether providence,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.600]   the word providence, is the best word for the reality.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.040]   That's relatively unimportant.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   The all-important thing is whether there is a reality
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.100]   in the Bible, which means is there a reality in the universe
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.720]   that corresponds to my description of the goal,
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.700]   nature, extent of God's providence.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.700]   So here are my answers to your question, Maceo.
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.080]   No, sovereignty and providence,
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.660]   sovereignty and providence are not the same.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.460]   God's sovereignty is his right and power
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.180]   to do all that he decides to do.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.000]   Job 42.2, I know that you can do all things
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.900]   and no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.600]   But notice, nothing in that definition of sovereignty
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.040]   refers to God's wisdom or God's plans.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.560]   It's just right and power.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.240]   You have the right and you have the power
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.460]   to do what you decide to do.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.520]   When he decides to do a thing, he does it,
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.400]   and no one can stop him.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.740]   That's sovereignty.
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.280]   So to make sovereignty a Christian concept,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.800]   a Christian concept, not just a philosophical one,
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.820]   to make it a Christian concept,
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.100]   we have to bring in other things we know about God
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.780]   from the Bible, like wisdom and justice
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.920]   and righteousness and grace.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   Providence, however, includes what sovereignty doesn't.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.980]   Providence, as I use the word,
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.040]   and as most Christians have used it,
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.040]   is sovereignty in the service of wise purposes.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.620]   I'll say it again.
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.620]   Providence is sovereignty in the service
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.960]   of wise, good purposes.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.580]   Or you could say wise and purposeful sovereignty.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.660]   That's what providence is.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.560]   Since his purpose is so central to his providence,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.220]   I spend, what, 150 pages or so clarifying
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.160]   what the Bible says God's ultimate purpose is.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.400]   It's not very helpful to try to nail down
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   the meaning of a word like providence
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.600]   by picking apart its etymology,
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   the history of its pieces, like providence.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   Because the Latin behind provide or vide is ambiguous.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:11.560]   It can mean foresee, so vide si, pro for, foresee.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   Or it can mean see toward.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.320]   And we have an idiom in English that says see to that.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.960]   That's an interesting idiom, isn't it?
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.080]   - Yeah. - What does it mean?
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.720]   It means take the steps to make sure it happens.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.240]   In fact, I think that is one of the most helpful
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.660]   paraphrases of God's acts of providence.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.420]   It is God's seeing to everything.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.800]   Absolutely everything that needs to be done
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.120]   to bring about his purposes,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.200]   God sees to it that they happen.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.760]   Isaiah 46, 10, I declare the end from the beginning
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.920]   and from ancient times things not yet done,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.600]   saying my counsel will stand,
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.560]   I will accomplish all my purpose.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.440]   In other words, I will see to it, see to it, provide.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.200]   I will see to it, I will provide, I will see to it
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.140]   that everything works together for the goals
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.240]   that I have for the world.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.640]   Let me close with one example from history
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.820]   that I think is so beautiful.
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.940]   This is question 27 of the Heidelberg Catechism.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.840]   Date on that is 1563.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.660]   Question goes, what do you understand
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.560]   by the providence of God?
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.560]   Answer, the almighty, everywhere present power of God
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.900]   whereby, as it were by his hand,
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.680]   he still upholds heaven and earth with all creatures
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.060]   and so governs them that herbs and grass,
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.140]   rain and drought, fruitful and barren years,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.780]   meat and drink, health and sickness,
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.780]   riches and poverty, indeed all things come,
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:03.180]   not by chance, but by his fatherly hand.
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.060]   That's a good summary of God's providence,
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.060]   his wise and purposeful sovereignty.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.380]   - Amen, thank you for that summary, Pastor John.
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.560]   All flowing from your book,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.140]   "Providence," tentatively scheduled for release early in 2021.
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.760]   Be looking for it.

[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.400]   when we ask, do stay-at-home moms get a day off?
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.240]   It's a good question.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.080]   We need to address it.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.920]   It's up next.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.080]   We'll see you on Monday.
