[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Continuing our studies of Nicodemus, the story of whom is found in the third chapter of the
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.180]   Gospel according to St. John, beginning at the first verse, I read the eighth verse in
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.280]   particular this morning.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.720]   The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.120]   whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.040]   So is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.360]   Now, we're analyzing this great and important case because, as I'm trying to indicate,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.840]   it has a great deal to teach us, not only in general about this great matter of receiving
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.000]   of the fullness of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is the very essence of being a Christian,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   but because it helps in a very particular way many who are in trouble about this whole
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.880]   subject, and very largely because they've been brought up in a religious home, in a
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.640]   religious church, and in a religious atmosphere.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.040]   As we've been seeing, there are many difficulties which we have to deal with and to overcome
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.280]   before we can go on receiving of his fullness and grace upon grace, and they differ from
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.280]   case to case.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.480]   Now here, I say in a very particular way, this particular problem is dealt with.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.440]   Nicodemus was a man who was religious, an able, intelligent man, a religious man, a
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.800]   moral man, a man who was concerned, as he saw it, with furthering the kingdom of God
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.800]   amongst men.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.120]   He was a master, a teacher in Israel, and yet we have found that he was radically defective
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.120]   in his understanding.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.240]   For it is to this man of all men that our Lord said, interrupting him, "Verily, verily,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.000]   I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.240]   And he repeats it, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.040]   of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.460]   Nicodemus' presuppositions are all wrong, and we summed it up last Sunday morning in
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.560]   putting it in this way, that the real trouble with this kind of person is that he is one
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.480]   who tries to go on with the journey before he's ever really started, or if you prefer
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.440]   it, he is one who's trying to grow before he's ever been born, or if you like it in
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.160]   more theological terms, it is the danger of putting sanctification before justification.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.640]   It's a very great error, that.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.680]   It's a fatal one.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.220]   So many of us have tried in the past to go on in the Christian life without ever having
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.520]   been in the Christian life, and you can waste years doing that.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.440]   That's why this is such an important and such a crucial case.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.640]   And what our Lord says to all such people is, "You must be born again."
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.680]   It's no use considering the higher reaches, if we may so term them, of the Christian life,
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.880]   or the depths of the Christian experience, unless we are absolutely certain that we have
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.760]   a Christian life, that we have been born again.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.880]   The rebirth is an absolute necessity.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.740]   No one can be a Christian without being born again.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.740]   You're not born a Christian.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.600]   The fact that you belong to a certain country doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.640]   Church membership doesn't make us Christian.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:58.460]   It means this new birth, birth from above, birth of the Spirit, this mysterious, miraculous
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:06.440]   operation of God the Holy Ghost upon the soul, mysterious as the wind itself, something we
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.440]   can't understand.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.760]   And poor Nicodemus keeps on trying to, "How can these things be?"
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.840]   He keeps on saying, "How can a man be born when he's old?"
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.200]   That's the utter folly which is displayed by this kind of person.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.320]   We'll try to understand everything, whereas by definition, this is something beyond understanding
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.880]   because it is the miraculous, mysterious, supernatural action of God in the soul.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:41.000]   Now, this, clearly, therefore, is a doctrine, a truth, which is given very great prominence
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.560]   in the New Testament.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.280]   And nothing shows its importance more than the variety of terms which are used in order
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.640]   to bring forth this teaching.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.320]   It is called here "being born again."
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   It is described elsewhere as "regeneration."
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.120]   Now, there's nothing more radical than that.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.040]   Generation, the thing that gives being to us, life to us, well, regeneration, not being
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.680]   improved, but being born, made, generated anew and afresh.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   And then it's described as a new creation, the term that's often used.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.480]   If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature, or a new creation.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.840]   2 Corinthians 517, "God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.200]   in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.880]   Like the first creation, it's comparable to that.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.640]   Something being made out of nothing, that's creation.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.760]   And so, you see, these are the terms that are used.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.640]   And then it's described as giving us a new heart.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.120]   The heart is a very radical organ, a new heart, or a clean heart.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:15.680]   Again, it's put in terms that we are made partakers of the divine nature, that's 2
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.960]   Peter 1.4.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:24.600]   James puts it in terms of our being begotten by God, through the Word, with the Word.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.560]   He hath begotten us, he says.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.080]   Again, it's the same idea, but the variety of terms is most interesting.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:40.120]   John, in his first epistle, keeps on putting it in terms of a seed of life, as if a seed
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:47.000]   were sown in our natures, in our hearts, a seed of new and of divine life.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.280]   The seed, he says, remains or abides in us.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.280]   And then it is actually described as, and compared to, a resurrection.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.200]   "You," says Paul to the Ephesians in the second chapter, first verse, "you, as he quickened
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   who were dead in trespasses and sins."
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.480]   Goes on to say that we have been raised together with Christ, resurrection from the dead.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.040]   And you get the same thing worked out, of course, in the sixth chapter of the epistle
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   to the Romans.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:26.040]   "Planted together in the likeness of his death, also in the likeness of his resurrection,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.320]   you've been crucified with him, you've been buried with him, you've been raised with him."
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:39.760]   Now these are the terms that are used in order to bring home to us the greatness of this
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.760]   matter of regeneration.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.000]   See, that's what makes a man a Christian, not anything he does, it's what's done to
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   him.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   And it's as profound as that.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.640]   It's not an improvement, it's not just a trimming, no, no, it's a remaking, a reconstituting.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:07.520]   It is the implanting in us of a new disposition, a new principle of life, which is a divine
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.520]   life.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:15.440]   Now that's the thing that makes a man a Christian, that's what our Lord is saying here to Nicodemus,
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.760]   who was already religious, already moral, already able, already well-versed in the Scriptures.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.280]   That doesn't, those things don't make a man a Christian.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.840]   This alone makes a man a Christian.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:33.320]   And that is why, you see, some of us are so fearful about this emphasis on decision.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:40.680]   A man does decide, of course, but he can only do so after this has happened to him.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.000]   The natural man doesn't want to decide, these things are foolishness to him.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.440]   You don't decide for Christ and because of that become born again, as I said last Sunday.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.000]   If that were the case, you wouldn't need to be born again, you'd have already had the
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   understanding.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.120]   No, no, regeneration is the first thing.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:06.660]   All you can do is to recognize when the Spirit deals with you that you are in this dead condition
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.100]   and cry out for life.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:16.420]   But this is the first essential, and without this there is no such thing as being a Christian.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.960]   This is what makes us Christian.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.080]   It is what God does to us, not what we do.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.680]   Very well then, how obviously important it is and vital to us that we should all be perfectly
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.680]   clear as to this and know whether this has happened to us.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.360]   He must be born again.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.160]   Very well, are we born again?
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.160]   That's the question.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.960]   It's no use saying I want to get on, I want these higher experiences, I've been reading
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.960]   about the saints, that's what I'd like to have and to be like.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.800]   My dear friend, before we go on I ask you the question, are you born again, are you
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   alive?
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.160]   You can't grow unless you're born.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.160]   Very well.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:02.520]   Well now then, here in this eighth verse, our Lord puts this matter to us.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.780]   The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof; but canst not tell
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.580]   whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:19.580]   So like that, comparable to that, is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:26.600]   Now this word 'so', you see, contains everything that we are going to study together.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.540]   Let me emphasize for a moment the word 'everyone', everyone.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:38.020]   So like that, is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.720]   I want to clear up a point here.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:50.300]   People are often in trouble because they find that they cannot make certain specific statements.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.260]   There is wrong teaching here on both sides.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:59.860]   There are some people who say that the 'so' means that everybody's experience in detail
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:05.420]   is identical with everybody else's, but the Scriptures don't teach that.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:12.780]   All that they do say is that the life that we all have is the same life.
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.860]   Now the actual process of birth may vary greatly from case to case.
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.220]   Sometimes it's sudden and dramatic, and one knows that it has happened.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.260]   It isn't always like that.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:31.960]   Actually, the act of regeneration, being God's act, is something that is outside consciousness.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.340]   You see, that's where our Lord's illustration here is such an important one.
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:42.260]   He says you don't see the wind, and you don't understand it in an ultimate sense.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.380]   What you do see is the effects and the results.
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.380]   That's what he's concentrating on.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.120]   "Thou hearest the sound thereof."
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.380]   You can see its effect on the branches and the leaves on the tree, or on clothes hanging
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.380]   on a line.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.800]   You can see what it's doing, but you can't see it.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.560]   Now it is like that.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.640]   So the important thing for us to concentrate on is the life, the manifestation of life.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.140]   If I may press the analogy, although it's a dangerous thing to do, and yet surely in
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:19.820]   view of the terms used in the Scripture we are entitled to do so, a birth may take place
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.660]   quickly or it may be very prolonged and slow.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.900]   It may be painful or there may be no pain, comparatively speaking.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.220]   There are all sorts of variations here.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.780]   I'm therefore not asking if you can point to a particular second or moment or hour or
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.000]   service or particular text which was used.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.300]   That's not the thing that's of importance.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:49.540]   What is of importance is, have we the manifestations of this life within us?
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:56.220]   You're not asked to spend much time as to the process of how you were born, but what
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.660]   you are asked to be certain of is this, that you are born.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.740]   That you are born again.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.540]   Now I trust that I've made that perfectly clear.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.420]   You see the devil is always there and he tries to confuse people.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:17.860]   There are very dramatic conversions, but a conversion is quite as well when it isn't
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.860]   dramatic.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:25.460]   The important thing is that we know that this great act has taken place in us, and that's
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.580]   the thing therefore to which we now turn, and with which we proceed.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.500]   What then are the characteristics of this life?
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.700]   That's the thing.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:42.260]   That's how you determine whether you are born again or not.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:50.380]   Well now there are a number of general characteristics which we must emphasize.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.500]   They're very important.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.300]   I sometimes think that these general characteristics are almost more important than the detailed
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.860]   characteristics with which we also hope to deal.
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.820]   General characteristics, what do I mean?
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:12.380]   Well the first thing I mean is this family likeness, family likeness.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:21.220]   The Bible, in its condescension and kindness, uses these familiar illustrations.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:26.060]   And therefore we are entitled to use them in exactly the same way.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:33.300]   And we are all familiar with this point, that when you have people who are born of the same
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:39.660]   parents, belong to the same family, though they may differ tremendously in many respects,
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.140]   there is generally a family likeness.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:51.620]   There is something in common that you can recognize in all of them.
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.140]   And that is profoundly true in this Christian life.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.620]   And as I say, I regard this as one of the most important tests.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.700]   I'll put it therefore like this.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:14.300]   When a man is born again, that becomes the most obvious thing about him.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:21.460]   You see what I'm saying is this, here are men and women, here's mankind and regenerate.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:29.260]   A man now becomes regenerate as others have become regenerate before him.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:38.780]   And my argument is this, and it is incontrovertible, because he now has a seed of divine life in
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:47.980]   him, because he now has become a partaker of the divine nature, that of necessity must
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.420]   be his chief characteristic.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:56.260]   That is true of all the others also.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.900]   This new life, which is so much bigger and greater and more powerful than the other,
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.700]   becomes the predominating characteristic.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:11.400]   He now begins to show and to display this feature, this characteristic, which is true
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.140]   of all who are sharing the same life with him.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:24.580]   So I deduce from that, that when a man is truly Christian, that becomes the outstanding
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.260]   thing about him.
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:35.860]   More outstanding than his color, more outstanding than his nationality, more outstanding than
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:44.700]   the particular type of school to which he went, more obvious about him than his profession,
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:51.420]   more obvious about him than his ability or anything else.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.900]   You see, you work out this analogy for yourself.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.860]   Take people on the natural level.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:03.700]   As I say, there they are, they differ in size, they differ in the color of their hair, complexion,
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.240]   and in their abilities in many other ways, and yet there is this intangible thing which
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.700]   tells you they belong to the same family.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.980]   That's the thing I say, which is the first and greatest characteristic of the Christian
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.820]   in many senses.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:25.660]   Let me try and put this a little further to you by putting it in this way.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:31.160]   It's one of those things which is very difficult to put into words, and yet one is always very
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.940]   conscious of it.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:39.100]   There is a general impression that one gives, and that's the thing with which we are dealing.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.940]   And the general impression that the Christian gives is that he is a Christian, that he's
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.860]   got this new life in him.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:45.860]   How does he do that?
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:51.140]   Well, he does it, if I may put it in a very general way, by saying that he at once gives
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.180]   you the impression that he's a spiritually minded person.
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.180]   Spiritually minded.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.460]   He must be.
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:04.060]   They that are of the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, says the apostle in Romans 8,
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.060]   5.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.820]   But they that are of the spirit do mind the things of the spirit.
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:16.180]   What he's arguing there is, as you saw, that there is this essential difference, this fundamental
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:23.420]   difference which covers everything, and nothing more than this whole general impression.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:30.860]   Now, forgive me for putting it like this, I've got to put it like this, and yet one
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.660]   doesn't like to have to put it like this.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:42.140]   I've often discovered this thing of which I'm speaking in this particular way.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:49.500]   I have known men who are delighted in talking about preaching.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:58.460]   Alas, I have known preachers of whom this is true, and still know them.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:08.420]   They talk about preaching, they talk about Christianity, they talk about the church,
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:13.220]   and they're prepared to discuss these things and to argue about them.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.820]   But one is always conscious that they're doing so with a kind of secular mind.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.180]   You needn't be a Christian to be interested in preaching, or in the affairs of the church.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.180]   You needn't be a Christian even to have an interest in the Bible.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:34.380]   God knows there was a time when I was guilty of the very thing that I'm describing.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.740]   I have known what it is to be arguing about these things, but it was purely intellectual.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.260]   It wasn't a matter of the spirit.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.380]   It wasn't because I had a spiritual mind, I hadn't, I had a secular mind.
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.600]   It was a carnal or a secular mind.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.980]   So that you see, this thing becomes very subtle.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.700]   It isn't so much what a man says that matters as the way in which he says it.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.240]   A man can be an expositor in a sense of the Bible, and a teacher of the Bible, and yet
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.340]   you feel there's nothing spiritual about what he's doing.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.780]   He can be giving you the letter, but never the spirit.
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.980]   There's no message.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:18.260]   It is a mechanical, superficial, external attitude, and it can be most fascinating.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:25.180]   But you see, here is one of these subtle points, it's difficult to put it into words.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:31.480]   But you find that the attitude of a man to what he's doing and saying is very much
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.520]   more important than what he's saying.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.780]   You can even be a defender of orthodoxy, and still have a secular mind.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.580]   I've known many such men.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:47.420]   Now, this question of the family likeness.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:54.620]   It is a possession of a spirit, and it is something that comes out in almost everything
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.620]   that a man does.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.580]   Well, very well then, having put it like that in general, let's go on and look at some
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.240]   other general features and characteristics.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:08.200]   Some of them are more subjective, and some of them are more objective, like the one to
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.080]   which I've just been referring.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.760]   That is one which a man himself is not always conscious of, but others are very conscious
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.760]   of it.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.000]   You recognize it, you can sense it in others, and that, by the way, then becomes a very
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.300]   good proof of the fact that you yourself are truly a Christian.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.820]   We'll deal with that later on.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:32.480]   But now, let's take another, and here it is.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:41.020]   It seems to me that a very valuable and a very thorough test in this matter is our consciousness
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.540]   of being dealt with.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:49.880]   You see, you can't be born again without being conscious of being dealt with, that
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.780]   something has taken place within you.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:22:01.700]   You are conscious of an interference in your life, and not you doing things, but things
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.720]   being done to you.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.920]   You remember the hymn, it puts it well in that verse, "Oh love that wilt not let me
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:18.500]   go," of Francis Thompson's Hound of Heaven, "He chased me down the nights and down the
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.520]   days, he chased me down the labyrinthine ways of mine own mind."
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.520]   That's it.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   That's the idea.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.000]   You see, it's another dealing with you.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.980]   Now, here is something that is most vital in this whole matter.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.520]   It isn't our action that we are most conscious of.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:44.960]   It is that there is another who is dealing with us, coming into our life, disturbing
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   us.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:51.360]   Well, we can do nothing better than take that great statement of it by the Apostle Paul
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:58.380]   in the third chapter of the epistle to the Philippians, where he puts it in a very striking
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.040]   phrase in the twelfth verse.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.040]   He puts it like this.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.720]   Let me go back to the tenth.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.640]   He says, "This is his great desire, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.400]   and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death, if by any
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.200]   means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:26.400]   Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after,
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:36.560]   if that I may apprehend that for which I am also apprehended of Christ Jesus."
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.560]   Which means this.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.520]   He says, "I don't say I've arrived."
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.880]   He says, "What I say is this," he says, "I am now trying to apprehend that which
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.080]   has apprehended me.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.040]   I am trying to lay hold of that which has already laid hold of me."
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.040]   That's the thing.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.480]   Now, that's a perfect expression of this particular point.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.360]   He doesn't say, "Now, I decided at a given point I would lay hold of Christianity.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.160]   I would take up Christianity.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.200]   I decided for Christ."
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.960]   What he says is this, "Christ had decided for me, or decided on me.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.520]   He had decided on me.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.920]   He had chosen me from my mother's womb.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:22.400]   He laid hold on me, and I am now trying to lay hold on this marvellous thing that he's
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.400]   done to me."
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   That's it.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:33.080]   And this, of course, by definition, must be true.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:38.040]   In the case of the Apostle Paul, one knows that it had all those dramatic elements which
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.680]   I say we must not overemphasize.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.880]   He was a special man in the sense that he was given a special work to do.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.720]   His regeneration is no different, but there were certain elements about his calling.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.060]   He used to be an Apostle, so he has to be able to testify to the resurrection.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.240]   He must see the risen Lord, and so on, but you see, that isn't the thing that he keeps
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.240]   on referring to.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.240]   This is the thing.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:11.200]   "He has apprehended me, he has laid hold on me, and I now am trying to lay hold on him,
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.500]   and on what he has given me, and what he has done to me."
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:23.720]   This is something that we can all only answer for ourselves.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:29.680]   You either are living a self-contained life, and in charge of yourself, as I put it, or
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:37.880]   else you've been disturbed, you've been interfered with, you're aware that something's happening
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.280]   to you, that God is dealing with you.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.480]   You don't understand always that it is God at the beginning, but you are aware, and you
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.000]   may even fight against it.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.320]   You may dislike it.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.880]   You may kick against the pricks, if you like, as Saul of Tarsus had done.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.880]   That doesn't matter.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.760]   The point is that it's there, "Oh love, that wilt not let me go."
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:04.120]   It isn't you, it's the love, the one who is loving you and who will not let you go.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:13.920]   This is, I say, foundational, this is something which is quite inevitable.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.560]   The Creator is dealing with you.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:26.120]   He's forming, or has formed, this new creature in you, and you are aware that it's been happening
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.500]   to you, being dealt with by God.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.360]   Somehow or another, this has gone out of evangelical thinking, even.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.760]   The emphasis is on man and man's decision.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.560]   My dear friends, we've got to get back to the biblical position.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:48.040]   When God deals with a man, he knows it's happening, and he's got to do something about it.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.160]   It is this love that will not let me go, and he comes in the end and says, "I rest my
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.440]   weary soul in thee."
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:02.440]   There's nothing to be more fascinating or romantic than to find people coming perhaps
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:08.840]   after months or even after years, to tell me how this happened to them and when it did
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.260]   and so on.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:17.160]   Without any pressure from me or from anybody else, it's God's work, and one knows when
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160]   it's happening.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.160]   That's the first thing.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.160]   Well, go on, let's go on.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:26.960]   Another therefore very important test, it seems to me, is this one.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.240]   A man cannot be born again without being humbled.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.320]   "Oh Lord, here you see humbled Nicodemus.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:43.000]   Here comes the teacher, the master of Israel, the able, godly, moral, religious man.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.040]   Master, compliment, I want to know.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:52.000]   Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   of God."
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   He's humbled.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.660]   And of course, this again follows by definition.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:06.160]   If we are in such a state and condition that nothing will suffice us except to be made
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:13.860]   anew, to be born again, if we are dead and need resurrection, it's a very humbling
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.160]   thought, isn't it?
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.160]   Very humbling.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.160]   There's nothing more humbling.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.040]   That is why people have hated the doctrine of regeneration more than anything else.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:29.580]   The two things that the religious person hates more than anything else are the cross of Christ
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:34.320]   seen truly as a substitution of the atonement and regeneration.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.320]   Why?
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   Well, because he regards them as insulting.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.240]   He says, I can't believe this, it's impossible, am I so wretched, so hopeless, so vile that
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   I've got to be born?
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.800]   The thing is insulting.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   They hate it.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.560]   And they hate the substitution of the atonement in the same way, for they still think they
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.880]   can do something, they can make some kind of atonement.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.360]   Well, here it is, it's very humbling.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:08.320]   And this is, I would suggest to you, the differentiating point above all others which shows you the
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:15.440]   difference between those who take up Christianity as they think, and those who've been taken
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.320]   up by it.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.320]   The one who's taken up is always humbled.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.180]   Now we must be clear in our definition of this.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:30.400]   It doesn't mean that you occasionally are a little bit frightened.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:35.920]   When you're taken ill, serious operation, or when a loved one dies, or when you're in
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:42.400]   a funeral, the natural men can be frightened by that and disturbed by that.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   I've seen that many times.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.720]   And then it passes, of course, and you forget all about it.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.880]   I'm not talking about that.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.860]   I'm not talking about an occasional fearfulness.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:57.560]   What I am saying is this, that no man is born again without some consciousness in some sense
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:02.600]   or another that he's been knocked down.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:11.280]   Again, you see, the Apostle on the road to Damascus is the classic example of this.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:18.280]   Again, you see, with all the dramatic elements, he was literally knocked to the ground, fell
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.740]   flat on the road.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.740]   It needn't be physical.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:30.400]   But there's always this knocking down, there's always this humbling.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:36.600]   The Apostle tells us in his autobiography, in Romans 7, more or less how this happened
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   to him.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.800]   He says, "I was alive without the law once."
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:50.120]   Again, in Philippians 3, he puts it, you see, as regards the demands of the law, righteous,
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.120]   perfect.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:56.280]   He was a self-contained, happy, self-contented man, felt he was keeping the law.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:02.520]   And then suddenly the Spirit began to deal with him and flashed upon his mind and heart
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:08.040]   and spirit the real meaning of the law, "Thou shalt not covet."
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.480]   "The law came, sin revived, and I died."
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.580]   He had to die.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.080]   And every man has to die.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.220]   A man can't be born again without dying, I mean in a spiritual sense, of course.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:26.920]   You must undergo this death to self.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.240]   You're knocked down, you're finished, you realize you're nothing.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.880]   Now, this is inevitable.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.360]   This is not a matter of argument or of dispute.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.000]   If you are conscious that you've got a new life that has been put into you, that you've
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.520]   been born again, well, what it tells you about what you had is inevitable, and you're aware
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.520]   of it.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.960]   You can't have the new without realizing that about the old.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:58.040]   And so, the man who is born again is a man in whom self-reliance has gone, self-confidence
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   has gone.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.840]   He is no longer healthy as he once was.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.320]   I was alive without the law once, gone, gone forever.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:19.480]   Or, let me put it in another term, a man who is born again is a man who is always humbled
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.280]   because he knows something about the fear of the Lord.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.600]   Here's the note that's missing, isn't it?
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:32.240]   Here's the thing that we've somehow lost, the fear of the Lord.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:38.520]   The Old Testament is full of this, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:44.580]   And as you read your Bible, Old Testament and New, there is nothing, surely, that impresses
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:51.680]   you so much and strikes you so much about these great heroes of the faith as this fear
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.240]   of the Lord that always characterized them.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.640]   Look at a man like Abraham.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.120]   You see it in him.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.680]   It was his outstanding characteristic.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:07.440]   He was a great man in many ways, but the thing that always strikes one about him above all
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:12.000]   is his godly fear, the fear of the Lord.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.200]   You get exactly the same thing with Moses.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:20.600]   Moses had to be taught it several times, but then it becomes his greatest characteristic.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.840]   He was given the great lesson at the burning bush when he was about to turn and to examine
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:30.800]   and the voice came saying, "Stand back, take off thy shoes from off thy feet, for
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.240]   the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground."
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.800]   And I'm here just to say that when a man is born again, he knows something about this
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   holy ground.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:51.400]   He can't help this, it's inevitable.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.960]   And so you find that Moses was ever aware of that.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.240]   It doesn't mean he's perfect, he committed sins, he wasn't allowed to go into Canaan.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.560]   It doesn't matter, the fear of the Lord, it's there in the whole of his life.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.760]   And take a man like David.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.320]   David could be a great sinner, but oh, if there's one thing that characterized David
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:16.680]   above everything else, it was his fear of the Lord, his reverence in the presence of
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.680]   God.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.400]   And you get it in the call of Isaiah.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.160]   He begins to feel, "Woe is unto me."
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.160]   Why?
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:30.320]   Well, the vision of God and the implanting of this divine life in the soul does exactly
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.320]   the same thing.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:37.200]   There's a very interesting phrase used, I think, about Hezekiah, where he says after
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.380]   certain things that had happened to him, he says, "I will walk softly."
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.000]   He's going to walk softly for the rest of his life.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.200]   Now, here is something that is a characteristic of the man that is truly born again or born
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.720]   of the Spirit of God.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.720]   He's been humbled.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:00.680]   And this is the thing I feel that is so often lacking in modern evangelicalism.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.100]   There is no sense of being humbled.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.840]   But it's inevitable in the light of this teaching.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:16.400]   You read the lives of saints in past ages, and you'll find that that's the thing that
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.500]   always characterized them.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.040]   They were men who had been humbled.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.280]   If you've ever met a person who's been through a revival where the Spirit of God has been
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.280]   manifest in power, you'll find that that's always their outstanding characteristic.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.280]   They have been humbled.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:37.680]   It's a godly fear, it's reverence and godly fear, so they walk softly.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.960]   They felt the touch of the eternal.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:45.680]   You get it even in the accounts of our Lord's miracles in the four Gospels.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:51.720]   Even unbelievers were, for the time being, filled with a sense of fear, and it certainly
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.560]   was the case always with the disciples.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.480]   Our Lord performs that miracle and enables Peter and the other to catch a great haul
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.480]   of fish.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:04.360]   And Peter goes to him and says, "Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful man."
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.320]   Our Lord hadn't rebuked him, he'd said nothing to him.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:14.280]   But the miracle, the manifestation of the divine, the miraculous, the eternal power,
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.920]   was something that inevitably humbled Peter.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:25.360]   And I say, this touch of the Almighty, this recreating act, is always something that humbles
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.360]   a man.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:32.200]   He's aware that he's been in the hands of God, and that he's still there.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:36.760]   Therefore, this is something that is always a characteristic, and that leads in turn to
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.140]   the next point I would emphasize, which is that a man who's born again is a man who's
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:49.080]   always undergone a true repentance, a true repentance.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:54.120]   Now you notice that I put my emphasis on true repentance, because we must.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:37:00.600]   There is a counterfeit repentance which we sometimes call remorse, and which has often
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.900]   caused people to mistake the one thing for the other.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:10.360]   So let me read to you what the Apostle Paul says about this in 2 Corinthians 7.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.520]   He had to write to the Corinthians over a certain matter and rebuke them.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:21.280]   He says at verse 8, "For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:26.880]   I did repent, for I perceived that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.160]   but for a season.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:36.860]   Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:44.240]   For ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:50.840]   For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.360]   world worketh death.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:59.720]   For behold, this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.880]   in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:10.920]   what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge, in all things ye have approved
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.600]   yourselves to be clear in this matter."
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.320]   That's the thing to which I'm referring.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:22.360]   In other words, when a man is born again, he truly repents in the sense that he has
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   this godly sorrow.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:31.160]   He's not only sorry that he's done certain things, he's much more sorry because he's
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.280]   got a nature that ever made him desire to do such things.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.440]   The godly sorrow is the sorrow of a man who's done something and he knows it's wrong, his
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:48.080]   own curd condemns him, and he's suffering the consequences and it isn't that.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.440]   The sorrow of the man who's born again is the sorrow of a man who's discovered that
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:57.720]   his heart is evil, that his heart is sinful.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:02.600]   He's a man who's unable to say, "With thee a puzzle in me that's to say in my flesh dwelleth
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.000]   no good thing.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.760]   I'm rotten, I must be made anew, I must be born again."
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:14.580]   And this is the thing that grieves him, the vileness of sin, the plague of his own heart.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.320]   This is inevitable in any man who has been born again.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   Again, let me be clear, I'm not postulating any intensity in the feeling of necessity.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.320]   The intensity varies.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.400]   All I am saying is that if a man hasn't discovered that he's got an evil heart, well he's still
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:39.820]   got it, and he hasn't got a new heart and a clean heart, he hasn't been born again.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:47.360]   But the man who not only knows that he's got an evil heart by nature, but mourns it and
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:55.560]   regrets it and hates it, and can say with David, "Create within me a clean heart, renew
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.040]   a right spirit within me."
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.040]   That's the Christian.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:05.680]   He's a man who's discovered this and he regrets it, he mourns over it, and with regard to
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.840]   everything that he does henceforward which is wrong, he says with William Cowper, "I
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:17.760]   hate the sin that made thee mourn, and drove thee from my breast."
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   That's true repentance.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:29.160]   It's a man, in other words, you see, who has seen why he had to be regenerated, and why
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:37.240]   nothing short of regeneration would suffice in his case, or be of any real value to him.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.640]   And that leads me to the last point with which I'm going to deal this morning, which is this
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.640]   one.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:47.480]   And here is a more general one again, like that first point with which I started.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.680]   I started with it, I end with it deliberately.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:56.880]   It's one again of those points which it's rather difficult to put into words, and yet
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:02.000]   the older I get and the more experienced I get in these matters, the more significance
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.160]   I attach to these general points.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:20.000]   There is about the man who is born again always a fundamental seriousness, seriousness.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   What do I mean?
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:34.080]   Well, I mean something like this, he's never flippant, he's never light, he's never superficial.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.760]   Have you known people like this?
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.600]   You're talking to them and there they are, typical men and women of the world, then you
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.360]   or somebody else introduce the subject of religion or of the faith, or there's a meeting
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.200]   to go to, and suddenly they have to pull themselves together, have to discipline themselves and
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:54.040]   change themselves, as it were, to something, and there's a tremendous contrast.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.080]   You feel you've got two different people.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:03.760]   I cannot reconcile that with regeneration.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.960]   If you have to put on the kind of face and mask and attitude when you deal with religious
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:16.080]   things, I say there's no life there.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:22.120]   That's the kind of quick-change artist which masquerades as Christianity, but it often
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.080]   does.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:31.920]   These people appear to be unnatural when they talk about these things, and if you appear
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.840]   to be natural when you're in the realm of the faith, well then you don't belong to it,
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.840]   that's all.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.480]   You haven't got the new nature.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:44.400]   This is the native air of the true Christian.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.920]   And therefore I say that he's a fundamentally serious person.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:54.080]   Let me hasten to say, I am not saying that he's a solemn person.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.100]   I'm not saying that he's a pompous person.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.200]   I'm not saying that he's a dull person.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.320]   God forbid that anybody should think I'm saying that.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:10.600]   No, no, he's a happy person.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:16.440]   He can even be a humorous person, but there's no levity about his humor.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.220]   It never runs away with him.
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:24.400]   It's a manifestation of life, it's the showing of one of his attributes that he's received
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:33.880]   by nature, but there's always a control, there's always this seriousness about him.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:41.160]   In everything he does, the controlling thing, the real great principle in his life, is that
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.580]   of a man who is a partaker of the divine nature.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:52.920]   So you see, you get it exemplified to perfection in our blessed Lord himself.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:59.440]   He's the son of God, he knew a joy and an intimacy with God that no man has ever known,
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:05.040]   and yet you remember he was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:10.840]   Obviously there was a joy that radiated from him, and there are touches here and there
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.120]   surely of a humor.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:23.440]   There was nothing solemn, dull, pompous, drab or dull about him, no, no, quite the reverse,
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.200]   the eternal reverse of that.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:32.280]   And yet he was a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   Why?
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:41.400]   Well, because he was the son of God, because he was holiness and perfection in an evil,
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.920]   sinful world such as this.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:50.120]   And all I'm arguing is this, that any man who is born of the Spirit, who has become
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:55.160]   a partaker of the divine nature, must have an element of that in him, and he has an element
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.240]   of that in him.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:01.360]   He cannot be superficial, he cannot be light and glib and flippant.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:06.840]   And when the flippancy and the lightness and the jocularity come into the realm of sacred
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:11.400]   things, it's still more terrible, but it often does.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:20.520]   No, no, this man is a serious man, he says with the Apostle Paul.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:28.120]   Even we ourselves who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves grown within
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:36.360]   ourselves waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body, or again take
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.440]   it in 2 Corinthians 5, there at the beginning, I was quoting there Romans 8, 23.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.440]   Look at this.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:46.480]   "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:52.120]   of God, a house not made with hens, eternal in the heavens, for in this we groan, earnestly
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:56.440]   desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven."
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.760]   Can you imagine a more fascinating character than the Apostle Paul?
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.840]   Does he strike you as being dull or pompous?
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.840]   No, no.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:09.620]   There's a warmth, there's something lovable, there's a geniality, there's a spirit, and
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:16.580]   yet there is this fundamental seriousness.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:22.720]   And the man who's born again must be like this because, as I say, he's a man who has
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:32.440]   discovered that by nature he was such, that he couldn't be improved.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.600]   He must be born again.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:41.840]   He sees evil and sin, the state of the world, and all that it is involved in what is coming.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:49.640]   And such a man is inevitably a fundamentally serious person.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:58.320]   Oh, get that right my dear friends, not dull, pompous, heavy, unattractive, oh that's Satan's
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.560]   counterfeit and it's done so much harm.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:05.240]   No, no, there's no contradiction between joy and seriousness.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:12.400]   The joy of the Christian is a holy joy, it's a pure joy, as are all the other things with
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.440]   which we shall proceed to deal God-willing.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:24.680]   Well, there, we've looked at some of the general characteristics of the man who has been born
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.680]   again.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.680]   Amen.
