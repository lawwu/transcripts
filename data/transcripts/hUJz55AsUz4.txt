[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   over lunch this individual told me you know every founder and every vc in china studies the west
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.080]   at a nauseating level so they listen to all the podcasts they read everything they possibly can
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.480]   they study any speech they look at the financials and he said the west doesn't do that of china
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.280]   and you know maybe we should be maybe we should be studying the best and the brightest over there
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:48.400]   hey bill great to see you good to see you brian summer has just blown past it's all it's almost
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.960]   football season yes uh how are the longhorns looking this year um they rank pretty high
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.560]   what's that mean come on give me the scoop i know i know you're all over that people that know know
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.960]   but they they have the dangerous starting position of being ranked number one in the country oh wow
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.680]   wow any big games coming up they uh play the number two team in the country this saturday and so we're
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.320]   gonna find out we're gonna find out we're gonna find out oh it gets real fast back to buckeye country
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.400]   yeah exactly it's been really incredible uh you know i just i just got back to silicon valley um after
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.200]   you know being away for a few weeks these you know the open ai deal the anthropic deal i was just
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.640]   looking at these i think these are bigger private ipos than any public ipo uh done in the last five
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.960]   years in the tech market right you had sam say the other day sam altman say you know two two things can
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.560]   be simultaneously true um one that this is the biggest thing to have ever happened in technology
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.520]   but number two uh that in the short run things become overheated and people are can get a little
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.280]   bit ahead of themselves where are you on that look there's just no denying that the amount of capital
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.920]   that is going into these companies earlier in their life and the scale of hiring and their willingness to
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.640]   take on risk which i think you can use cash burn as just a proxy for risk because you get further away
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.760]   from knowing unit economics and and you're more threatening you know i i think what those numbers
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.640]   are unprecedented like even against you know the uber doordash wars and all this they're bigger than that
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.960]   and so i think it's part of we've talked about it i think it's part of a systematic trend where investors
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.080]   are aware of network effects they've watched companies that get the initial conditions
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.000]   right go on to really big outcomes and they're willing to bet ahead of the curve and as the more
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.640]   confident they get over more time the more they're willing to make that bet ahead of time and um and so
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.280]   you know it is what it is we're seeing you know massive numbers well i'd say it's it's a combination of
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.880]   two things extraordinary scaling we've never seen two companies in the case of open ai scale
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.600]   uh users and scale revenue as fast as they are but definitely you're absolutely right the private
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.520]   markets are there to meet them um and we're seeing the depth and the breadth of capital and investment
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.080]   in the private markets i think unlike anything we've ever seen but you know we're going to save that for
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.280]   yeah save it right let's save it we're gonna save it let's save that for another day we're gonna do
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.400]   something a little different today um you know one topic that i think um we we've hit on time and time
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.280]   again but we're gonna we're really just try dedicate the show to it today and that's china you know you
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.760]   just got back from china it's one of the hottest in many ways most consequential and also most
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.240]   controversial debates i think in silicon valley and in washington you know on the one hand you have
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.400]   i think national security economic hawks you know who are in this camp that we should decouple it's a
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.560]   a little bit more cold war 2.0 yeah a great power struggle this is the meersheimer perspective you
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.920]   know maybe in the middle you have you know tech pragmatists i guess i i might call them you know
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.240]   like jensen wang or tim cook i'd probably put myself in this camp who thinks we we have to compete we have
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.000]   to re-onshore industry you probably should have some tariffs in order to achieve that but you you definitely
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.560]   can't decouple or ignore or or antagonize and then maybe on the other end you have kind of the globalists
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.160]   i don't know jeff sacks jeffrey sacks is probably in this camp it's free trade open science collaboration
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:39.760]   and you know there's this is of tremendous consequence to issues around tariffs and trade issues
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.720]   around military issues around ai and there's this new book out by dan wang that i want to talk about
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.800]   um you know uh where where he really takes on the differences between the two countries but why
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.400]   don't we start with you know this trip that you recently took you know you you just got back from
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.240]   china why did why did you go you know and frankly especially given all the you know blowback
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.200]   you've gotten personally benchmarks gotten uh with respect to china maybe for having too soft of you on china
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.000]   give me your inspiration for wanting to go and spend as much time as you did studying china
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.280]   yeah so i i've probably been four or five times before this trip but i hadn't been since um covet and
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.600]   i've been reading you know about everyone that's been going we talked about thomas friedman's comments
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.080]   um from his last trip and you hear about all the things that are different um you know personally my
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.400]   my daughter's an asian studies major so she went on the trip with with myself and my wife and so you know
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.160]   you know with her studying that topic this is i thought it'd be a great chance for her to see
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.560]   things too um much younger than us but i wanted her to go around and the fact that she speaks mandarin was
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.680]   helpful on on the trip as well but you you know you just said something right you said this is probably the
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.320]   most consequential you know other nation when it comes to thinking about america or thinking about
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.400]   our stock markets or thinking about how technology companies are evolving and so i just wanted to
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:22.160]   learn like like like why wouldn't you want to know more i don't understand how you if it is the most
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.280]   consequential relationship for our country why you'd want to know less right and so um i've always enjoyed
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.200]   going over there i've always enjoyed learning things that i don't know um and i really wanted
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:42.640]   to see it up close and personal um one thing that was super helpful was uh dan wang who you just
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.720]   mentioned gave me a early copy of his book so i read it on the way over there tell us tell us a little
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.640]   bit who is dan wang so um it's a gentleman that lived over there he lived over there during covid
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:02.480]   um you know he's a he's a policy analyst um and he recently moved back to the u.s um he's at the hoover
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.040]   institute yeah been studying china for a long time looks at it through the lens of technology and
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:14.320]   innovation and the book's titled breakneck and it's really talking about some of the acceleration um that
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:21.440]   we've seen in in building you know inside of china but but it i would suggest the two things about the
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.440]   book that are really interesting one he kind of uses as a mirror back on the u.s so it's really about both
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:35.040]   countries it's not just about china um and then two he's balanced like he talks about the pros you know and
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.840]   the cons of what have happened over there he starts with with this chapter that was recently republished
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:49.280]   in the atlantic where he highlights that the vast majority of the political borough are former engineers
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.920]   so this is the the ruling party within china and that the vast majority of the people in washington dc
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:03.200]   are former lawyers and you know that he uses that lens to say this is why they're great at building
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.400]   things and maybe why they're not so great at social things i think he gives the edge to having the
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:15.600]   lawyers to protecting free speech and personal rights he did not enjoy the lockdown in shanghai which was
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:22.800]   fairly abrupt um he's very negative on the one child policy and for those people that don't know
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.120]   the the chinese government's now trying to encourage people to have three children
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.800]   not successfully but that's the new program um so they've completely flipped from where they were
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.720]   um but but it's a fascinating read it's a very personal read you can tell that you know his life
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.200]   journey his parents were born there and left you know and went to canada and that's how he grew up in
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   the west and then he went back and so he has it's i think it's a really interesting lens but it's very very
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.120]   current one of the things he really dives into and this is something that that people that i've talked to
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.160]   you that know china have known this for some time but i don't think the general people understand this
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.880]   so one of the things that's led to the vast build out so we've read about high speed trains we've read
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:15.520]   about overnight cities we've read about their number of companies in the solar space in the ev space one
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.400]   of the reasons that happens is the provincial leaders compete with each other so the provinces are very
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.720]   competitive with one another not in the same way the states are really um one of the reasons this
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.800]   is true is if you run a province and do well you put yourself in really good standings to move up in
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.480]   the federal government but wouldn't you say that's it i mean that seems to me like gavin newsom competing
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:47.120]   you know with desantis in florida on you know who is more business friendly who is tougher on immigration
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.200]   it seems a little bit the same way i think it's a little bit the same way but the difference is
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.840]   that because there's a singular government that's going to make choices like like in the u.s if you do
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:04.480]   well as a governor you might get elected got it but in this case it's more like divisions of a company
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:12.240]   and if you run one well you might get the ceo job and and so that competition you know leads to
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:20.080]   overbuild in certain cases so there's several ghost cities um that that are buildings that are empty you
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:26.000]   know where they've built too fast they are now facing problems even though they're the world leader in evs
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.240]   and the world leader in solar panels where some of these companies need to go bankrupt and a province
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:39.920]   may not want them to because of employment issues right and so the the those are the those are flip
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.600]   you know two sides of a coin you get one benefit you get hyper competition we talked about the thousand
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:52.320]   flowers bloom so this the the federal government publishes every five years this this mandate of the
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.760]   things these are the things that are important and you need to go work on and then the provinces you
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:04.480]   know go go at it like they go right against those initiatives and that's that's how they've got taken
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.760]   a lead in those things we mentioned and energy production right you wonder we talk about all the
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.760]   number of nuclear plants that they have new nuclear starts solar farms wind farms i'm going to dig into
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.600]   that bill i think there's this general view that china's good at building things building iphones but
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.840]   perhaps not at innovating right and then you know jensen huang reminded us recently that 50 percent
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.760]   of the world's ai researchers are in china and they're indeed innovating and not copying you know
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.040]   on the ground when you look at the things happening in auto when you look at the things happening in
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:47.760]   ai when you look at that things happening in space or energy etc um how would you compare contrast as a
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:56.800]   venture capitalist the level of rigor and innovation and excitement enthusiasm um and investment i guess
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.600]   going on against these you know critical future industries well if you're over there
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:10.080]   you you know that the bite dance founder is just remarkably unique you know leijun at jami
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:18.000]   is remarkably unique and if you spend time um studying those people i just i don't know how you would
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.720]   possibly think that they can't innovate i mean tick tock was there first right and then it came here and
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:31.680]   then reels copied tick tock one thing that doesn't seem like innovation but i was surprised by pop mart is a
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:39.600]   uh 40 50 billion dollar public company which is a children's toy company that started in china and is
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.320]   everywhere over there but like just the idea that that there is no innovation you know one one of my
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.880]   favorite meetings and i promised i would protect the innocent so i'm not going to share who it was with
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:13:01.120]   but over lunch this individual told me you know every founder and every vc in china studies the west
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:08.720]   at a nauseating level so they listen to all the podcasts they read everything they possibly can they
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.880]   study any speech they look at the financials and he said the west doesn't do that of china
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.600]   and you know maybe this goes back to my main motivation for going over there to learn but that
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.920]   i thought that was a very provocative statement that he made you know and um maybe we should be
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.680]   maybe we should be studying the best and the brightest over there well let's say let's dive into
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:40.000]   you know maybe one industry i i guess as a lens yeah i know you spent a bunch of time uh in the auto
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.440]   industry yeah right looking at all of these new entrants and i would help us understand the
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:51.680]   innovation that's happening there are two dimensions one on uh you know just electric vehicles number two
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:58.320]   on you know maybe autonomy and then number three i'm just curious like how tesla is able to compete so
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:07.120]   effectively you know in a market where you have this hyper competition uh for electric vehicles yeah so i i i had
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:14.560]   a number of auto experiences when i was over there first of all i i was invited to um visit byd this
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:22.800]   is my they gave me a nice coat i um i met with stella lee who is their number one executive i think
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:28.560]   facing outside of china um she runs all their europe initiatives for those people that don't know byd is
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:36.880]   the largest ev manufacturer in the world at about four million vehicles um they started in batteries
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:44.400]   they they you know they compete in with uh foxconn to build mobile phones they bought jabel circuit you
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:51.840]   remember that old company i do and they make lots of things they make buses and subways and all kinds of
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:58.880]   different things but they got into cars uh over i don't know about five to ten years ago um they have
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:05.520]   a number of models they gave me this one this is you know a very kind of high-end sports car in fact i
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:11.440]   met a public company ceo that was proudly showing me this was his favorite car that he drives around
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.200]   they make an suv you can drive into the water wait i don't i don't know exactly why you'd want to do that
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:24.480]   but we rode it into the water drove around in the water and drove out um they have cars at 10 to 15
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:30.480]   grand price point on the entry side they've hired a european designer it's just how they're building
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:39.600]   stuff like this um on the higher end um and um they're very aggressive from a cost perspective
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.840]   yeah i think byd more than anyone on the cost side it's not preventing them from building higher
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:56.240]   in cars as well um so that's byd i also had a chance to visit xiaomi they also gave me a car the uh the
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.680]   xiaomi is a super interesting story if people don't know so i i would i was fortunate enough to meet
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:11.360]   leijun back in 03-04 um but about 13 10 to 13 years ago he started a phone company and that's what xiaomi is
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.840]   and that company's now third i think around the globe and handsets sold heavy in europe heavy in
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:25.520]   south america not just china um and three to four years ago i think around 2021 he decided to build a
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.800]   car and it was about the same time apple said they were going to build a car and and mind you this guy
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:38.880]   was back in 03 ran an e-commerce company called joio like like he's he wasn't i there's no reason he
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:45.520]   he should be able to build a phone and then build a car so what do you attribute that to bill like why
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.480]   you know when you see that you know again going back to dan wang's book he's like this is an
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:56.960]   engineering culture that has built these technological ecosystems that gives rise to a higher velocity of
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:02.240]   innovation uh you know than we see in the united states that dan would argue is bogged down by
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:10.320]   you know regulatory capture and lawyers etc why do you think uh you know xiaomi is so successful
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:16.560]   and by the way let me just share with you some numbers so so they're making uh a thousand of these
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.720]   a day they just came out with a kind of a kind of a thousand cars a day yeah in in this in the factory
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:29.680]   that i went to um it it it they're sold out they have like a 30 to 40 week backlog um you have to
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.200]   pay five grand to get on the waiting list the factory this is an interesting data point the factory
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:41.360]   makes a thousand cars a day with two thousand employees um it was highly automated like really
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:48.320]   highly automated i imagine that they plan to improve that number over the next five years let's say they
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.000]   took it to a thousand employees for a thousand cars that'd be employed per car per day that number is
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.320]   like at six in the u.s and that's super interesting for a number of things like if you want to bring
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:06.480]   the jobs back there by the time you get the jobs back there may not be any jobs like like at one because
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:14.800]   of automation the entire global you know potential for car manufacturing in five or ten years from now
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:21.360]   could be like 400k total and so you know we we we just need to be really thoughtful about those things
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:28.560]   but but back to lejun he gave a talk in 2024 we're talking about maybe people should be watching and
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.360]   learning in both directions that i would encourage people to watch it's on youtube it's his state of the
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:40.400]   union from 2024 and he spends about an hour talking about his approach to building a car and it sounded
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:49.840]   like so ridiculously i don't like like you ask about entrepreneurial he he he decided that he hadn't
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.880]   been driving a car for 10 years because he had had a driver so he immediately switched seats with his
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:02.560]   driver and then he um he went through the parking lot at his company and if there was ever a car he had
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.880]   not driven he'd leave a note on it and ask to borrow it and then he would have the uh the owner of the car
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:15.280]   tell him what they liked and didn't like so he claimed he drove 170 cars that way um and then he
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:22.080]   also like byd they hired a european designer um that came in and helped him out but for an entrepreneur
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:30.320]   who had never been in a car business to build a factory in a three-year window and look the same
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:38.000]   thing was true our friend omid built a factory in texas you know you know under 40 like just spectacular that
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   that that these entrepreneurs are capable of doing these things but it just kind of blows my mind
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.600]   like when i was being driven in this golf cart through this factory just thinking that this person
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.000]   wasn't in the business three or four years ago and for for people that don't know i'd encourage you to go
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:02.400]   online and and so uh the ceo of ford farley he went over there and i think had the exact same tour i did
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:09.520]   and he insisted they ship him one back to chicago and he's been driving it around and he's made some
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:16.080]   pretty extreme statements um after having experienced john me this car sells for about 40k
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.560]   but he said it's the most humbling thing i've ever seen and he says even beyond that their cost
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:28.480]   their quality of vehicles is far superior to what i see in the west we are in a global competition with
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:36.240]   china and it's not just evs if we do not if we lose this we do not have a future at ford you know that
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:42.800]   that's farley at ford you know and and i by the way i would take a pause after mentioning that to the
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:49.520]   people that are gonna um accuse just because i went over there to learn accused me of somehow being
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:57.040]   like a an agent for the ccp is that also true of the ceo of ford you know like why is he saying these
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:03.120]   things like we're just witnessing what's happening on the ground one of my observations is and you hear
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.560]   this from elon you hear this from jensen huang you hear this from tim cook you hear it from farley
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:16.880]   it's extreme respect for the for the level of innovation um for the focus for the engineering
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:23.360]   led culture that exists in china and that to me one of the reasons i wanted to do this pod
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.680]   on china is because i think it's as much a reflection about what the united states
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:35.040]   needs to do to re-engineer its own society right it's not enough to say that we want to re-onshore
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:40.640]   critical manufacturing it really is about you know this movement around american exceptionalism america
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:48.000]   builds it's about making the reforms necessary whether it's regulatory capture whether it's the
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.600]   you know tort reform legal reform required to frankly allow uh uh you know this level of innovation and
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.400]   recognize that we're in this global competition you know and there are two ways in which you can you can
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:07.680]   approach this bill one is we can build barriers we can try to decouple and we can pretend the rest of
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:14.160]   the world somehow won't buy china's goods you know but if you look at it today the u.s only represents
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:22.320]   about 14 percent of china's exports the u.s only represents about three percent of china's gdp yeah
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:29.920]   right so like we're just not that important to china i don't want to understate like you know
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:36.240]   we're still very significant but china has found a market in europe they found a market in africa they
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:44.560]   found a market in south america right and it it seems to me that the harder pill for the us to swallow
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:50.800]   and this is where i think that you know i i'm in the camp of of those in the middle who say we need
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:56.640]   to engage we need to compete there is a competition we want to win the competition but this is about
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:02.880]   focusing on us and winning and running a faster race we have a lot of reforms i think a lot are occurring
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.720]   now i think we're doing the type of things that we need to be doing um in order to get more globally
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:14.880]   competitive there are industries that are critical to our national security um you know
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.960]   things like rare earth magnets things like uh you know steel productions things like pharmaceuticals
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.840]   where i think it is appropriate to have both an industrial policy and a tariff policy that's going
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:33.920]   to provide the incentives to those industries um but it it's you know to me uh you know the reflection on
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:41.920]   what i hear you saying about china when i read dan's book is that china is putting the accelerator to the
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:50.320]   floor in terms of innovation and it's in every single industry it's powered by you know the this provincial
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.840]   competition you talked about is powered by people who are just you know naturally entrepreneurial and
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:01.360]   hard-working um and there's no escaping that and there's no putting that genie back in the box would
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:08.000]   you know what are your thoughts on that yeah no i think it's exactly right i mean byd has um a big
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.160]   presence in hungary and they have a fact they're building a factory in or already have one in mexico and
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:23.440]   why if you're mexico would you not buy the 10 to 20 grand ev why would you buy the 50 grand one from
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:30.160]   america it just doesn't make any sense right like you're if for any country around the world and i could
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:37.440]   reflect this on the us as well if you're not gonna buy you know domestically you you should certainly buy
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:44.320]   from the low-cost producer right it goes back to to comparative advantage right if you if you
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:51.760]   can't produce a globally competitive product and you close your import border your people are forced
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:25:00.560]   to buy a product that is overpriced and and and not and and so from a from a standard of living
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:06.480]   perspective they're worse off than they would be if you had opened the import door and so i don't you
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:14.160]   know i'll give you another example of this so this is the the byd this is the apollo um competitor to waymo so
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:19.520]   we we've we've seen the waymos around austin and san francisco we've ridden in them this is i've
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:26.000]   ridden in this now um it's a little bigger i think a little roomier than than than the jaguar for sure
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.560]   um it's more of an suv um but this is on the streets you know and apollo is kind of interesting
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:38.000]   it's inside of baidu which is a search engine company um while people are simultaneously what people
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.600]   are saying that that the waymos should be worth 170 billion inside of of google you can buy shares of
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:53.200]   baidu for zero enterprise value it's a 30 billion market cap 30 billion in cash on the books um and
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:26:00.720]   from a global perspective i don't know why if this is 30k why you'd want to deploy waymos which people
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:07.360]   say are over 150k partially due to the to the mem solid state lidar advantage that china has which
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:15.040]   we've talked about previously so yeah i think rest of world is a really interesting thing to think about
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:21.920]   you know when you compare the two countries because i don't think that i i personally and i i don't have
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:28.240]   a ton of data on this but i i personally don't think all the other countries in the world share the same
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:36.320]   level of hawkishness that at least part of the members of our national government have and so i
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:42.720]   don't think they're going to be as afraid of their technologies let's think about this in the context
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:51.600]   of you know uh uh uh what you've seen if you were giving advice to trump uh on export controls for
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:27:01.200]   example bill um you know whether it's on you know ai chips or other things um you know would you be
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:07.760]   uh you know what would your advice be well i mean i think you hit on some of it around the red tape
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:13.680]   and you know there's a couple different things in certain industries where we're really behind
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:21.600]   i would be very open-minded to jvs coming towards us you know for the past 50 years you know european
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:28.320]   car manufacturers u.s car manufacturers they opened facilities in china some of them were forced to be
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:36.240]   49 owned 51 owned i'd be very open to that kind of thing um there was some positive news out this past
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:42.560]   week um following trump's engagement with korea around nuclear which we have talked about before
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:48.000]   korea can build a nuclear plant for one-fourth the price that we can why don't you invite them to come
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.840]   help us build a few in the u.s and see what we can learn and i wonder if we should allow for there's
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:28:00.000]   going to be there are so many ev companies i didn't even mention you know neo and zeeker and
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.080]   some of these other things they're all innovating in different ways but some of those are going to
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.600]   have financial trouble neo's public you can see that that the stock's not doing all that well but
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:15.600]   would we let a ford or a gm buy one of those companies right maybe we should i don't know if
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:22.000]   the china government would let them would we let one of those companies open a jv with ford or gm in
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.640]   the u.s i think we should if we'd learn from it and you could say the same thing about solar
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.560]   or any of these technologies where they have a lead solar nuclear so i would be open-minded to
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:38.960]   those types of things um i would be really big on trying to get regulation out of the way and recognizing
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:47.040]   that that an autocratic country that has specific goals can move so much faster
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:53.680]   um in any industry than you ever could in the u.s because we've created so many people whose jobs that
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:59.840]   are to block things um and we're seeing i think we're seeing that type of behavior in certain states
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:08.240]   which is why tsmc's in arizona which is why tesla's in texas i would give governor shapiro a lot of credit
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:15.440]   um for reopening three mile island and what he did with i-95 like like all those things are signs of
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:24.160]   recognizing that we've built mud you know in in our system um that prevents building and how do you how
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:31.200]   do you get how do you start to remove that and move in the opposite direction specifically uh you know
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:38.080]   thinking about the tariff so you know i think that the president uh tweeted yesterday morning if you know
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:43.200]   if we don't get it was appearing that we're on a glide path and making a lot of progress with china
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.000]   we may very well be i think he tweeted yesterday morning that if we don't get rare earth magnets
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.720]   from china he could raise the tariff rate to 200 percent there was some talk that he was going to
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:59.120]   visit china in the first week of september so that's you know right around the corner um i said on a couple
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:06.000]   pods ago i thought that you know the way to understand uh this president is that he's a self-described
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.400]   deal junkie he's a pragmatist he's not an ideologue it seems to me that when he's talking with jensen
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:19.120]   huang and others he falls in that kind of pragmatic centrist category um he certainly wants to rebuild
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.400]   stuff in the united states but at the same time it appears to me he wants to get a big deal done on
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:31.760]   china where do you come down again if you were advisor on the tariff side of things bill um do you
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:37.280]   think he's going to get a big deal done with china do you think that's the right thing uh to do and
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:44.400]   how do you think that influences uh some of the building that you're talking about okay this is i have
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:50.800]   zero insight like i didn't i didn't i didn't meet with anyone in the in the ccp or the government so i
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:58.800]   have no idea what with their mindset this is pure speculation on my my point my part um you already
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:07.280]   brought up the fact that that we're a much smaller percentage of their exports than people realize and
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:15.920]   people think about and as a result you know i think that they're going to be china is going to be far
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:27.280]   more um biased by what they view as as fair and and face-saving than they are necessarily like numeric
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:34.080]   and so i think if we if someone were to approach them in a pragmatic way i think a pragmatic deal could
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:41.200]   easily get done i you know if they are engineers as dan wang said i it's not like you know that they
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:49.520]   wouldn't accept a pragmatic outcome i think they would but if we um if we're intent on being derogatory
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:56.080]   in our language and and by the way that's the thing that i just really don't understand um that you
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:02.800]   see in washington you see it on that select committee of the ccp and you see it from some of the the the
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:10.080]   people in silicon valley i just don't understand the value of being uh belligerent and but but many people
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:16.560]   clearly are i mean they have four times the number of citizens on this earth than we do and um none
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:23.920]   everybody's you know country of birth is something that happens to them outside of their control so i i just
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:30.160]   don't know why vilifying uh a billion people is a good idea um so i think it's possible i think
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:37.840]   there's a i think they would do a deal um and i just don't know if uh if we get caught up in a silly
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:45.840]   tit-for-tat verbal war what the benefit of that is and anything like that and this is one of the points
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:53.600]   sacks makes um jeffrey sax not david you you you might provoke world war three so what do you what
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:33:01.680]   what do you what's how do you put that into your mpv calculation is it fair to say that you know i think
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:09.840]   if you look at tariffs um heading into this year they basically doubled on china but if we put tariffs on
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.840]   you know particular industries in order to incent uh building and industries in the united states
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:22.800]   imagine it was a deal a bit like japan bill where we also you know cut a deal with the chinese that
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:28.720]   they had a trillion dollars of investment the way we have with other companies that go into the u.s
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:34.880]   into some of these uh you know industries and that we perhaps get some reciprocity and
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:40.480]   reduction of barriers to some chinese goods into into china where how would you handicap that did you
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:49.200]   get any sense um uh or or or you know do you get any sense from the uh the stuff you read in the united
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.400]   states as to the the probability that i think it's one of the biggest influences as we look at growth in
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.240]   the back half of this year as we look at market sentiment in the back half of this year
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:03.200]   just curious where you stand on that ironically one of the things that i mean like i said i met with
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:09.920]   i met with companies and founders and and and a few academicians but i did and some journalists but i
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:16.160]   didn't meet with with the government but in general there's just not any hostility from their side from
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:23.040]   that group of people that i met with in fact most of those um most of those people look up to the u.s
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:29.280]   founders that have done great things the jobs and the elons and most of them aspire to compete
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:36.640]   globally the same way a founder in the u.s would like and so they would like to see all this rhetoric
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.840]   die down and they would like to have the opportunity to come to the u.s market they'd like the opportunity
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:48.800]   to compete in europe and south america many are xiaomi and byd already are and so i think like i
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:57.600]   said i think there's a pragmatic deal to do um to the extent and and if if that um led to the types of
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:03.680]   programs that i just talked about this kind of jv thing where there's a market there a leader in and we
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:09.760]   you know have that company come to the u.s and help us understand um how to compete in some of these
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:15.360]   technologies and get to lower price points i think that'd be fantastic do you feel like over the last
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:21.600]   20 years who do you think's gotten the best out of the relationship bill you know i haven't read this uh
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:29.680]   apple china book um yes it a lot of people have been talking about it and i aim to um it it
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.040]   i think the problem with looking at it that way is you know you and i've talked about this finite
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:44.240]   versus infinite game is you know where are we in the time of the planet and what do you think the
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:51.280]   planet's going to look like you know 15 20 30 years from now i mean i think it'd be very easy to say
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:57.760]   you know using your framing to say the u.s took advantage of europe post-world war ii and a lot of the
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:03.760]   manufacturing that existed prior to world war ii shifted to america um and so you could then with
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:12.240]   that same frame say yeah china you know grew on the back of america and and you know from from that time
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:18.080]   but i kind of look at it another way which is there have been different periods where these different
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:24.320]   countries have industrialized you know we were a huge beneficiary post-world war ii because most of asia and
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.360]   in europe had been blown up and there was no production capability whatsoever and a lot of the
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:36.080]   kind of glory day mindset that we have about what life and generational change should be like in the
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:43.600]   u.s come from that time um which is a bit unfair i think from a global perspective but there's a ton of
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:50.560]   hard-working people over there you know denxiaoping brought capitalism underneath the uh the chinese
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:59.520]   government and led to the biggest you know um increase in standard of living of any it's like 500
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:05.280]   million people came out of poverty as a result of that and you know when people say oh we should have
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.160]   never let the jobs go over there i'd i don't think they really want to say well we shouldn't have let 500
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:16.320]   million people out of poverty uh you know it's the same people that that uh want to talk about aid in
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:24.480]   africa and whatnot so a lot of people benefited in china um but they're also hard-working people and and
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:31.840]   and we we talk a lot about meritocracies right and some of the same people that talk about meritocracies
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:39.040]   are anti-china and so that that's a hard thing to square because if someone's willing to work twice
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:46.800]   as hard you know as you and you know willing to study harder and and all that kind of stuff are they
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:54.720]   do they not deserve a chance at a life like you have i think the bigger complaint is that um we were
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:02.800]   naive in our trade policy and therefore we allowed huge advantages to flow to other areas
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:10.240]   and you know by the way as dan says in his book at the same time we were actually moving to more of a
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:15.760]   regulatory state in the united states so you know like our companies were getting less competitive at
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:22.560]   the same time we were helping their companies get more competitive and there was a lot of collateral damage in the united states
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.440]   in the united states during that period of time and i think right now people are saying okay we're moving
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:33.760]   into this age of ai but we have to get back to driving reform in the united states that levels that playing
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:41.680]   field a bit um and so you know you can't you can't undo the past um but i do think there's a recognition
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:48.960]   that um you know we need to do the things in order to incentivize u.s industry to compete more effectively
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.400]   in a lot of these different categories um i think it is going i think it is going to be tricky though
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:02.480]   you know if you say you know you've got a hundred competitors in the ev industry in china they're all
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:08.720]   willing to work on razor thin margins and they're willing to sell cars into europe at twenty thousand
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:15.360]   dollars or twenty five thousand dollars today as farley said there is not a u.s manufacturer sans
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:22.160]   perhaps tesla that comes anywhere close to being able to compete in that way on a global basis correct
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:29.600]   one thing i've been studying a bit is i i do think that the chinese government's more has more
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:36.560]   scrutinous of monopolies you know i don't think that they i think they would consider it a negative if there
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.440]   were seven companies worth three trillion dollars or whatever like i don't think they care about
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:47.280]   market cap i think they care more about employment and global competitiveness which would cause you to
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:53.600]   support low margin companies um and and you know they they get to choose to make that choice i'm not
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:59.120]   judging it but it would result in this outcome you know there's in addition to the farley quote the
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:06.000]   mercedes ceo said we need a reality check um when he was talking about chinese evs and then
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:14.080]   stelantis i guess is the new name who uh who rolled up a bunch of other car companies uh they said chinese
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:23.280]   evs are quote possibly the biggest risk facing his car maker and tesla um and uh he criticized this is
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:30.880]   carlos tavares he publicly criticized eu tariffs on chinese electric vehicles calling them a major trap
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:37.200]   for automakers and this is this is you know you talk about what policy would fix things i'll tell
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:43.280]   you what policy will make things worse you know you start protecting us industries by putting export
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:48.960]   tariffs on the most competitive products around the world which i talked about earlier now your consumers
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:55.280]   don't have access to those price points and so you're buying inferior goods at inflated prices
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:02.720]   and that's going to lead to inflation and prosperity and standard of living levels dropping in the us so
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:08.080]   there's a lot of variables i would say that's generally true i think if there's a moment you know if there
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:16.720]   was a national strategy to improve competitiveness in an industry that had been you know um uh uh let's just say
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:23.600]   had an unfair playing field for a period of time like i could see a national strategy for example
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.640]   we talked about pharmaceutical manufacturing we talked about chip manufacturing we talked about rare
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:34.240]   earths where you would say okay we're going to actually impose a tariff because these other goods
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:40.160]   are flooding and it deprives us of the ability to build our own domestic industry but i think we have
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:46.160]   to be very careful when you do that bill to your point we know that unfettered competition will lead to
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:53.040]   uh you know is going to lead to much better products much lower prices and when you start protecting these industries
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:42:02.080]   what i worry about is you protect the regulatory grift and the the the the over lawyering that dan talks about in
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:09.040]   his book right we got to face up to this fact that we have to reform some of these uh you know basic things in the united states
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:15.040]   and that's why you see companies like tesla moving to texas where those reforms are moving forward and i think
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:22.320]   you know i think we are making progress on that but i you know i think you there is a rationale uh for those
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:27.920]   critical national industries but i generally agree with you that if we move to high levels of protection
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:35.200]   because we simply can't compete because it takes you know us uh you know 10 people uh in an auto
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:40.080]   plant to do what they do with one person in an auto plant i think that's unsustainable you and i think
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.720]   we need to be careful with the rhetoric we throw around so so i'll give an example so um if you read
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:52.000]   what comes out of the biggest talks they say well everyone in china just steals things and the government
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.320]   subsidizes everything so when i i brought that up with uh i brought up the subsidization with
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:03.680]   stella lee at byd and she said she said if i'm getting all this government subsidy money can you
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:09.120]   please find it and show it to me we're we're a public company come show me the money i'm getting from
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:15.920]   the government she's like say i'm getting nothing and um and and then you know you look at the u.s like
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:21.840]   we give companies subsidies all the time to build factories we've had ev credits for the past 10
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:28.080]   years both at a state and a federal level um intel's getting money from the u.s government like i don't
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:34.000]   understand where we're saying like like it's very unclear to me like what we're pointing at and
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.200]   accusing and why it doesn't it isn't the same thing here and then lastly you know elon's published all
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:50.240]   the tesla patents okay so there's free ip for ford and gm and i would ask you with that free ip if we gave
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:56.480]   ford and gm subsidies do you think they'd immediately be competitive with china no sir
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:02.640]   okay and if i ask a hundred smart investors that question what would they say i think they'd agree
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:08.880]   with me yeah so so so so the thing we're accusing them of being the reason they're succeeding
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:14.400]   if you flipped and gave that to the u.s companies none of us have confidence that would work
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.840]   so that's what i'm saying just gotta try and get as much information as you can learn as much as you
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:26.880]   can um so that you i i just want people to have a pragmatic view and an accurate view as they make
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:35.680]   decisions i i did a deep dive on on your favorite product chat gbt uh 300 version deep research and on
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:42.240]   the 24 members of the select committee for the ccp and i think all but four have never been to china
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:48.560]   all right and the ones that went it was seven years ago i just encourage them to go visit if they're
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:54.400]   going to sit there and have um such strong opinions it'd be good if they were educated i wouldn't want
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:59.600]   if you were putting together a committee inside of your corporation um that's going to be in charge of
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:05.520]   something wouldn't you want the most educated people on that committee i can already hear the criticism
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:15.600]   oh yeah um you know of course people would say well we don't expect the ceo of byd to tell you the truth
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   necessarily about government subsidies or or things like that um but here's the one thing i want to get
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:30.320]   across in you know kind of this pragmatist camp we do have to be self-reflective right i mean if we have
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:36.480]   this if we have this view the only reason china's competitive or winning is because they're they're
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:43.920]   stealing or they're subsidized i think what that view does is it allows us to delude ourselves into
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:49.520]   believing we don't need to get better ourselves yeah like it's like if you're playing a competition
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:55.680]   and you know your your kids out there playing in a football game or a swimming race and they lose
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.400]   the race and they come back to you and they say well the only reason that person won was you know they
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:06.240]   cheated you know like your advice i think is no you've got to get better yourself we've got to get
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:14.160]   better how can we get better and i think that's why cultivating this balanced and realistic view of china
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:20.560]   what's actually happening on the ground how hard right folks are working what the level of innovation
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:26.480]   is the fact that the united states is is is a diminishing part of their trade of their gdp
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:34.160]   etc i think that should cause us to look a little bit inward about how the hell do we accelerate how do
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:40.080]   we build more how do we invest more how do we you know get more globally competitive why does it cost us
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:45.120]   four to five times to build a fission reactor in this country why are we building no nuclear reactors
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:50.720]   in this country and so the good news is this i feel like there's a lot of momentum under this
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.360]   administration that was building before this administration around investing in america
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:01.120]   getting more globally competitive right a lot of people want to build things here again you know and
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:07.440]   and and you got you have somebody like jensen huang who says both can be true we need to sell h20s and
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:13.440]   b30s into china we need to stay relevant in their ecosystem but at the same time we need to build
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:19.120]   plants in arizona and we need to rehabilitate and invest aggressively in our own domestic chip program
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:27.040]   those things can be simultaneously true um and it it's interesting that all of those ceos who spend the
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:32.480]   most time competing in china you know they all fall in that pragmatist realist camp
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:39.200]   um you know in the center about you know the united states needs to get serious about the work that it
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:44.880]   needs to do if it wants to remain globally competitive with that said bill can we shift for a second i want
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.040]   to i want to you know look at this through the lens of kind of just what's going on in ai
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:55.520]   you know um i know you spent a bunch of time over there looking at the key players on the model side on
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:01.600]   the you know thinking about the chip side etc um so maybe just round out that other conversation and
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:10.480]   then shift there yeah so so um one thing one thing to note that um that isn't in the dan wing book but i
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:16.720]   i think that we can infer from it the government every five years publishes this five-year plan
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:22.960]   the last one was the 14th and i think the next one will be coming out soon i would encourage everyone to
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:28.160]   read that because that's where they tell the provinces what's important to work on
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:34.320]   and that historically has led to these areas where they're investing heavily and they might make a
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:39.840]   mistake in what they say to focus on but when they've gotten it right it's led to a lot of global
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:45.920]   competitiveness so i would watch that but in the in the last one in the 14th they literally talked about
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:53.280]   open source um and so you know i i'll put a link in i found a document that covers all the history of
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:59.200]   chinese open source but it goes back 20 years this isn't an overnight thing um and our government
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:04.960]   recently said they were pro open source in this new ai executive order but but but this was kind of
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:11.920]   pushed out to the provinces and so two two things i would say about the ai market there first of all
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:18.960]   no one's particularly concerned about there being a monopolist because there's so many open models so
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:26.000]   there's in general i think from the entrepreneur's perspective um a more relaxed you know opinion
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.320]   because they can work on products and they can take in all these different models i think i think deep seek
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:39.200]   has the most kind of intellectual brand because of how that arrived and and and almost the the the
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:46.320]   national pride that came along with it um quinn um is a really important player mainly because
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:52.640]   uh alibaba leads in the cloud market over there they're about us you you may you and your team may
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:58.800]   know more of these stats than me brad but i think they're like a 70 player in the cloud market and so that
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:03.920]   just gives them a natural place to deliver models from that makes them important and then on the
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:10.640]   consumer side you know byte dance it seems to be the company to watch on anything consumer and they
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:17.280]   already have an app if someone said whose app is closest to open ais in china it's already an app from
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:23.600]   byte dance um that's out there people on the watch list people are very curious if 10 cents gonna do
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:30.080]   something you know obviously they wechat still extremely um important in china and so that's a
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:35.120]   great asset if they were to bring something but they haven't been particularly aggressive and then jami
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:41.840]   because of leijun everybody wonders what he might do and you know owning the phone and that big a
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:46.480]   market share might give you some advantages we've talked about that with the us players so that's kind
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:52.400]   of that's what i would say is the state of affairs over there on and when it comes to ai on the model
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:51:02.640]   layer um is it do you think there's an acknowledgement or a belief uh that they're basically they have the
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:08.800]   tools they have the chips you know with huawei etc to be competitive like is there a sense in china
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:14.960]   that you know quinco is going to be competitive with clod code um you know we know they're all open
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:20.960]   source do you think there is a sense that they all stay at the frontier like i had that since before i
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:26.880]   went just because of the number of competitive open source models and the way they can trade train each
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:33.840]   other you just have a much more natural environment to have this kind of hyper competition that we talked
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:40.000]   about in evs or solar like having that many open source providers gives you that i would say even
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.800]   maybe more because of the way the models can help one another at least in the ev case like you can't
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:52.000]   take someone else's ev and make yours better but here you can can we talk about that just open for a
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.360]   second let me double click on this you know obviously we saw open ai open source you know a model a few
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:05.120]   weeks back now we have comments this week out of elon uh they're they're getting back to more
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:11.920]   aggressively open sourcing um you've obviously got meta already uh uh you know with llama out there on
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:18.240]   the open source front and i saw you had a tweet yesterday maybe bill just on you were surprised that
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:24.560]   google had not taken a more aggressive position with respect to open sourcing gemini um do you think
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.200]   they will why do you think they haven't and why do you think it would be the right thing for them to do that
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:34.320]   well i i had some replies to that tweet to get into this but this goes back to where you started the
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:44.000]   podcast i don't think public companies understand or i don't think they've internalized um and and really
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:50.400]   come to terms with the fact that the private markets are willing to bet so aggressively on these new
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:56.240]   players and i you know we're talking about ai today but this could be true of any new disruption in
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:01.680]   the future when i was going through the the uber lift wars and you know we'd be in board meetings
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.120]   and look at these burn rates and all this money we're spending you talk about whether or not to
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:10.000]   raise another round and certainly thought about doing what sam did and trying to talk capital out of the
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:17.040]   market which never seems to work um but you get frustrated with that game and you want to you know but
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:24.000]   but you're dealing with business decisions that you would never see in another industry and so
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.880]   getting back to the question you asked you know i just don't know like if everything's at stake for
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:36.960]   google should they be willing to lose five or ten billion dollars because the startup that's attacking
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:43.520]   their space is willing to lose that amount of money and i think it's it's it's an ironic situation we're in
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:49.280]   where the private markets and the startups are willing to be more aggressive perhaps and more
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:57.200]   risk-seeking than the public incumbents are and i think you know our friend rich barton took a lot of
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:04.080]   heat at zillow when he when he chased opendoor but he was faced with a situation where a private company was
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:10.400]   claiming it was gonna out innovate him and disrupt his game and and some of wall street had come to believe
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:15.920]   that and so he engaged and he played that game on the field now that eventually turned out to not be
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:22.080]   true um and and maybe if he hadn't engaged competitively with opendoor maybe they wouldn't
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:27.600]   have have kind of tripped and fallen but but it was probably the right thing to do and i don't think a lot
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:34.240]   of public companies think that way now google historically when it came to aws open source kubernetes
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:39.600]   and went after him when it came to apple they open sourced android and certainly some of their their lower
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:45.600]   models are open sourced and competitive on open router but maybe they should be more aggressive
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:51.360]   even still because of what's at stake that was that was my point okay shifting back real quick and you
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:59.920]   know we'll round up here on china um you know the vc market in china we just rewind the clock you know not
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:06.480]   it was not that long ago bill um and you know there was a lot of us enthusiasm there were a lot of us
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:14.960]   firms investing directly in china um right from sequoia to ggv a lot of those firms either shut down or
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:23.200]   spun off their operations uh you know in china benchmark has taken a lot of you know heat for doing an
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   investment manis that you know i've i've read benchmark explain really isn't even you know
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:34.800]   based in china what do you see you know when you were there do you see a lot of us investors actively
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:40.960]   investing on the venture side in china and then what is the chinese venture ecosystem look like so
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:47.520]   a couple different things so first of all um there's a real lack of westerners for all my trips this was
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:53.680]   the the fewest westerners that i've ever seen and the high-end hotels and the high-end restaurants were
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:56:01.040]   fairly empty um and i think that it just has to do with the thawing of the relationship um that's caused
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:11.040]   less travel from westerners um the vc market um is in a bit of a lull because when when these policies all
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:18.960]   changed and when you know the jack ma thing happened when dd got pulled back from the u.s markets when
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:25.680]   the for-profit education companies got taken out and when uh you know wechat went i mean tencent went
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:32.960]   flat for a couple years because of games reforms all those things um took a lot of air out of the system
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:38.560]   and caused a lot of people to reconsider and then you also had and i don't even know if this was more
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:43.360]   led by the u.s government or the china government you had the splitting of the venture capital firms
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:50.960]   sequoia split in half ggv split in half and and so there are much fewer western dollars available to
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:57.040]   invest in china and so you know there are a few firms that have stayed you know neil shin at hongshan
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:02.480]   had raised a ton of money right before all this happened he's very active has a huge staff of people
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:11.680]   um anafang and zen fun which is a angel group are very active and idg is highly present and has been
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:18.320]   active but that's only three firms you know and compared to where things were six years ago when
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:24.480]   every one of our um competitors in the venture industry were making an annual trip it's it's kind
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:32.880]   of night and day um and then there's not that many um r b dollars available to the venture market a lot of
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:40.480]   the you don't have the foundations in and university endowments that you do here and the billionaires
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:47.600]   that have made wealth typically are looking to diversify offshore and so you just don't have a lot of
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:54.240]   r b dollars seeking a home and now you have the provinces entering the investment space which is
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:58:00.560]   an uncomfortable reality for some of the vcs they're asked i hear they're asking for terms that you and
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:09.680]   i would consider um non-starters you know um and so that's it's all a little bit messy um it's funny
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:17.360]   because it's simultaneously with some of these markets evs uh autonomous uh robotics where they're where the
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:23.280]   country is doing extremely well so i found those things off a little bit and it's very everyone's
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:29.920]   very aware that if the government decides um your company is doing something that's not in the best
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:35.760]   interest of the uh citizenry that that's going to get corrected and so there's a phrase i don't know
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:42.240]   if it was in dan's book or i read somewhere else called don't be the tallest tree that's a problem for
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:52.720]   you yeah exactly um yeah is it in that regard do you think you know that's what i was i was wondering
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:59:00.960]   you know there seems to be a ton of entrepreneurial activity despite the fact that you know vcs have
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:06.560]   retreated that you have companies that are not going public and have been shut down you have entrepreneurs
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:13.840]   that have gone missing it doesn't really seem to have diminished you know the activity around uh
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:19.760]   you know around ai as we're talking about clearly or startups or entrepreneurism and in fact a lot of
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:25.760]   the locals heavily dispute that financial times graph that was going around about the number of startups
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:31.840]   they said it just mismeasured the whole thing and so no i i don't sense that there's any lack of
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:40.480]   enthusiasm from entrepreneurs and towns like shenzhen um where where dgi and byd and huawei are all
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:49.360]   located i mean that town is a new young 20 million people a highly energetic you know town with lots of
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:56.640]   stuff happening you know lots of stuff you said something to me um well before before we wrapped is
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:02.320]   there anything else anything else that we we didn't cover that you wanna you wanna hit on there's two
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.440]   there's two things i would hit on you know you talked about innovation one thing one thing that you
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:14.480]   notice very quickly as a westerner is no one takes credit cards yeah they used to like the last time i went
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:22.240]   but it's almost a hundred percent uh wechat pay and alipay and if you can't get those to work on your phone
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:28.080]   you're screwed man you can't pay for anything um what's what's the government's position on crypto
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:34.800]   i don't know the answer to that question okay i don't but but because they've been using these apps
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:39.760]   for so long um you've started to see incremental innovation around that so
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:46.800]   most restaurants you go to not to very high-end ones there's a qr code on your table that qr code not
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:52.240]   only represents the restaurant but it represents the table and you can order from that you can pay
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:57.920]   from that like like so if you are done eating and want to pay and leave you just scan and pay and go
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:05.280]   you walk right out and um you know we we're far away from that in the us that amount of of automation
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:11.440]   around payment um and it's just interesting and and that goes from you know the high-end hotel and
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.680]   restaurant will take wechat pay and the street vendor will take it right it's it's it's universal
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:24.560]   so that's one thing the other thing that i would just mention um very recently china announced something
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:33.120]   called the k visa and one of the um one of the things that's happened recently because of i'd say an
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:40.880]   increased um agitation between the two countries is there have been a number of very recent policies
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:48.880]   in america that are impacting skilled immigration especially at the university level and i did hear
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:56.000]   stories over there of groups of 50 or 100 phd students who had been admitted into a university and
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.560]   we're now being told they can't attend and you and i and everyone have talked about skilled immigration
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:09.920]   and how that's been kept flat in the u.s um and now you know at least with regard to china we're starting
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:16.720]   to put up blockers and on top of that you've seen these other charts where like 50 percent of the ai
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:23.440]   researchers in america are chinese and so that that's something that's super interesting to watch and
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:31.600]   this k visa thing which they've never done before says if you are studying um technology you know i
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.480]   don't know the exact rules you don't even have to have a job so this isn't like a in the u.s you need
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.720]   a you're welcome to come they're going to give you a visa so china's basically inviting everyone to come
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.000]   to their university systems from around the globe i don't know how successful they'll be i don't know if
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:56.400]   europeans will go there um but it's an interesting thing to see again it's just a reminder to me like
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:03.200]   i i continue to think that uh the u.s is in an incredible position on a global basis an incredible
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:10.000]   position vis-a-vis china but decisions matter and you know we talked about stapling a green card to every
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:17.040]   you know uh every diploma as uh you know the the president did as part of the the the presidential
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:25.440]   race um and certainly i think there's ample opportunity uh for upside to accelerate to attract
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:32.880]   to build in the u.s and i hope that one of the takeaways of this conversation the many conversations
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.960]   we ought to have and it's why i think being overly dogmatic leads us astray is we got to reflect on
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:43.840]   the things that we can be doing better to run a faster race ourselves right and i've heard you say
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:50.000]   this before you know the old quote from the godfather never hate your enemy enemies you know it clouds it
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.440]   affects your judgment yep and i think there's a lot of that going on in silicon valley and other places
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:03.200]   that um you know we're going to be a lot better off if we're very pragmatic about uh there's no slowing
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:08.160]   down in china they're going to be there in ai they're going to build chips at huawei they're going
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:14.880]   to build models at deep seek and the the way to beat them is not to you you know try to cut them off
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:20.320]   at the knees we don't need to make it easy on them but the united states needs to accelerate our race
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:26.640]   and i think by if we focus too much on how do we slow down china we take the eye off the ball on how
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:32.000]   to accelerate our own race so it's fun spending one of these just digging deep on a on a particular
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.080]   topic sounds like an incredible trip yeah and i would just echo what you said like like on especially
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:44.960]   just on learning like my my main point to anyone that's interested in this topic would be just make
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:52.640]   sure you have the exact right information as you then go to make decisions especially around policy
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:05:00.640]   um and you know talk read read what these uh global uh car ceos are telling you they've been over there
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.440]   they're seeing it with their own eyes they they don't they don't have a reason to be as candid as
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:11.200]   they're being necessarily but they are um and then read dan wang's book i think it's fabulous like
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:17.040]   tyler kyle said it might be one it might be the best book of the year it's very well written and
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:22.560]   and a joy to read and i would uh encourage everyone to go pick it up it's called breakneck i think it's
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:31.600]   out now today now you literally can go on chat gpt and just ask it you know uh what your favorite ceo
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.880]   you know what's jensen wang think about uh the level of competition in china what's tim cook think
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.880]   what's elon musk think um the reality is the people who spend the most time on the ground in china
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:50.720]   have the most respect for you know the innate uh you know capabilities and ongoing competition that
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:57.120]   we're going to see with china and you know and and i thought that dan had a really balanced view at the
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.560]   end which is you know we shouldn't go out of our way to make it really easy on china but at the same
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:08.400]   time we got to engage we got to be you know pragmatic we can't stick our head in the sand
