[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.560]   you get to bring up topics that I might not bring up, answer questions in a more interesting
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.960]   way and get a little bit of personalized insight and advice.

[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.160]   We begin with Andy in Indiana.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.160]   Andy, welcome to the show.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   Thanks for taking my call.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.480]   I think the sort of high level picture of what I wanted to ask was what mental models
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:21.080]   and tools and decision making frameworks do you use for somewhat open ended, hard to define
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.440]   things like which job should I be applying for, which of these jobs that I applied for
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.480]   should I take or buying used cars, I feel like is similar.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.760]   So the specifics of my situation, my medium term goal is to move from a onsite technician
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.920]   role company I'm with to a completely remote non technician role going from hourly to salary.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.640]   I was I started working down that path a few months ago and then they completely closed
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.100]   down a lot of salaried hiring.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.560]   So that's not available at the moment to me.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.760]   However, there is there still doing internal hiring for other hourly roles.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.160]   And so I do have the option to take or to apply for and or take some slightly higher
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.720]   level hourly roles doing different work.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.480]   My intermediate term goal is I'd really like to get away from like I'd like to do something
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.480]   different than what I'm doing.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.640]   I've been in the same role for several years.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.920]   I'm not finding it challenging or stimulating the schedules got less appealing, etc, etc.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.280]   So I'd like to get out from that.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.000]   I also think I'm not like I'm not going to get any more qualified to move up doing the
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.240]   work I'm doing.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:46.640]   And I could go do six months or a year, whatever of some other role and be more qualified for
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.560]   the eventual job that I would like to get.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.520]   So then I find that I spend a lot of time and mental energy saying, well, you know,
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.000]   I don't see any perfect jobs.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.280]   Do I like a better than B is, you know, schedule freedom more important to me or is challenge
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.520]   more important to me?
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.120]   And I don't think there's necessarily a right answer there.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.760]   But how would you think through when I'm like, I would be happy to take a high schedule freedom
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.080]   job with lower responsibility and do something else different.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.280]   But I'd also be happy to take a more challenging, less schedule freedom job.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.640]   And I don't know what my I just find I get sort of bogged down trying to decide which
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.640]   ones should I pursue.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.240]   Should I cast the net really wide?
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.000]   Should I have a really narrow focus?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   That sort of thing.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.960]   In some ways, it would be nice if there were just a narrow focus.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.000]   I've always admired people who always knew exactly what they wanted.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.960]   They're sure that they they're sure they want to do this thing.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.600]   It's very clear to them and they're on track and and and, you know, we're going to go and
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   get this done.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   No problem.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.560]   Unfortunately, that's not generally been my experience.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.600]   And I think that's not an experience for many of us.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.560]   We have to go and search a little bit.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.760]   Excuse me, I had to cough.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.760]   Here are the models that I find to be most useful.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.840]   The first one, I think just comes down to vision is I have discovered this to be the
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.680]   most powerful is simply that if your vision is clear, if your goals are clear, that makes
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.040]   decision making relatively simple and straightforward.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.960]   That doesn't mean it's easy.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.960]   But the first question I ask myself is, am I having trouble deciding because I'm genuinely
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.980]   having trouble deciding or am I having trouble deciding because I don't know what I want?
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.120]   It's probably just as frustrating for me to say, well, get clear on what you want as it
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.280]   is to say, you know, what job do you want?
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.520]   But the point is simply that a job or any decision in life is going to, you know, what
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.440]   car you buy, etc. is going to be driven by your vision.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.760]   And let me give a couple of examples from people that I have known.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.080]   There have been people that I have known whose primary goal, their primary vision was to
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.300]   make a large amount of money.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.840]   And in order to do that, they set themselves off on the career path that was most likely
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.920]   to make them a large amount of money.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.240]   Sometimes that came with very heavy consequences to their social life.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.020]   Sometimes that came with very heavy consequences to their family life.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.940]   Sometimes that came with very heavy consequences to their health, etc.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.720]   But eventually they wind up succeeding and making a lot of money.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.200]   In my circles, I've known a lot of people who have prioritized other things.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.840]   I've known men who prioritized their family.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.400]   And so, you know, I knew one man who he, for a decade of his life, he worked, he was a
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.600]   highly qualified engineer, had no problem there, but he worked, actually for more than
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.760]   a decade, he worked a half-time job so that he could homeschool his children.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.320]   His wife was there, but he wanted to do the homeschooling of the higher level subjects,
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.320]   etc.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.600]   So he worked a half-time job.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.640]   That undoubtedly cost him hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars, both in current wages
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.200]   and in opportunity cost of investment growth, etc.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.240]   But he had a vision of what he was trying to build that caused him to go in that direction.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.720]   I've known men who had a vision of wanting to be able to work with their children.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.680]   And so, instead of taking a corporate job where they wouldn't be allowed to see their
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.320]   family, they chose a pathway that allowed them to work with their family.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.760]   I've known people who just loved adventure.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.000]   And so they would go off and chase adventure, etc.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.720]   And so it seems to me pretty obvious that your vision will drive your job choices in
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.920]   some way.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:54.120]   I, myself, my vision of freedom and control over my time, control over what I want to
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.100]   say, control over what I want to do, etc., has driven each and every one of my decisions.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.960]   And there's been many times when faced with a decision that I've said, "Well, am I going
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.160]   to do this certain pathway?
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   Am I going to go down this path?"
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.800]   And I realized, "Well, Joshua, is your vision still that you want freedom or honesty or
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.300]   liberty, etc.?
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.800]   Or is your freedom that you want to make more money?
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.760]   You'd probably make more money if you took this path."
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.560]   And generally, I find that if I'm clear on my vision, then things fill in.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.800]   Let's use a vehicle analogy to make it clearer, right?
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.520]   Your vision of what you want to do with the vehicle drives your choice.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.240]   The choice of whether you buy a pickup truck or whether you buy a sports car is driven
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.400]   by your vision of how you imagine yourself driving it.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.280]   The vision of whether you buy a nice big Jeep that you're going to take off-roading every
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.360]   weekend or overlanding every weekend up in the mountains is different than your vision
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.080]   of buying a little two-seater to get you around in the city.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.120]   Your vision of a new car versus an old car is driven by – or sorry, your decision of
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.640]   a new car versus an old car is driven by your vision.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.440]   And so, one of the things I've noticed in financial counseling over many years now is
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.800]   that when somebody doesn't know what to do, my best work is not generally going to be
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.360]   to tell them what to do but rather to try to help them get clear on what they want by
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.100]   sometimes laying out alternatives, suggesting courses of action.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.480]   Sometimes I'll suggest a course of action and just see how they respond or react to
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   it.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.720]   Sometimes you want them to kind of glom onto an idea and say, "Yes, I really want this.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.240]   I really want that."
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.040]   Sometimes you want them to just recoil from an idea and that recoiling from a certain
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.340]   thing helps a lot.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.440]   And so, I believe that if you're having trouble knowing what to do, then generally speaking
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:47.240]   the most fruitful area of focus is to say, "What kind of vision do I have?"
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.280]   Now I can anticipate the next thing.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.840]   "Well, I have multiple visions."
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.840]   Okay.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.280]   Or, "There's multiple things I could be happy with or I could be contented with multiple
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.280]   pathways."
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.280]   So there I think that one of the things that we want to play with is the vividness of a
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.600]   description.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:11.120]   And so, I have found for me one thing that's been helpful is to just take an idea, and
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.120]   this works well for me.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   I'm not a very mechanical guy.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.280]   I'm an idea guy so I can manipulate images and ideas in my head very easily.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.640]   But I'll take an image and I'll just blow it up and I'll say, "What if I were hyper
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.760]   successful at this job?"
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.760]   I've shared publicly.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:32.000]   This is one of the things that caused me to leave financial planning in the formal sense
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.200]   to go after radical personal finance.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:43.680]   I took my current more standard job and I said, "What if I'm hyper successful at this?"
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.880]   And I imagined myself as a managing partner of a big firm with the money and the schedule
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.880]   and everything like that.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.280]   And I said, "Okay, now I know what that looks like."
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.080]   Then I took my – I checked out what does failure at that mean, but I wasn't worried
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.120]   about failure then.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.720]   Then I took my alternative path and I said, "What if I'm hyper successful at the alternative
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   path?"
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.100]   And I sketched out what that would mean and then I said, "What if I'm a complete failure
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.740]   at the alternative path?"
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:16.400]   And what I found is that I was more excited about even being a failure at the alternative
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.320]   path than I was about being hyper successful at the known path.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.580]   It just wasn't very exciting to me.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:30.380]   So amplifying and differentiating them is, I think, sometimes useful.
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.320]   And this leads me to the next one, which is regret.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.520]   Is that I think a lot of times you should ask yourself, "Which choice am I going to
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.720]   regret more?
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.920]   And which regret am I more likely to have?"
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:52.200]   So that word regret, I think, touches at a core emotion that for many of us is a very
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.540]   off-putting emotion that we don't want to experience.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.640]   But we can understand it a little bit if we engage with it.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.980]   So here I think of – let's say you're in college and you say, "Well, I could stay
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:11.000]   up late and I could study for this exam and get an A or a B, or I could go to this concert
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   with my friends.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.360]   Well, what am I more likely to regret in the future?"
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.340]   Well, it depends on what happens with it.
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.660]   If this A or the B on this exam is the thing that's going to mean you either flunk out
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:29.440]   of college or suffer some massive problem versus being very successful in college, then
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.400]   certainly you would want to study.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.440]   But generally speaking, you probably have things mostly in hand and the fear of regret
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.560]   is just something to illustrate to you that I should go with my friends.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.760]   This is a component of what I'm doing.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.160]   Or not pursuing things that are interesting.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.920]   I find, at least for me, the fear of regret is – and actually the emotion of regret.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.160]   I try to discipline the emotion of regret because it's kind of a worthless emotion
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.680]   when it actually happens.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.400]   We all make the best choices at the time with the information that we have.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.240]   We do the thing that seems best to us.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.480]   If in hindsight later we would make a different decision, we can't blame ourselves for that
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   or engage in this feeling or emotion of regret.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.040]   After all, we did the best we could with the information that we had.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.280]   All we can do is go on and make a different decision in the future.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.680]   So I don't like the actual feeling of regret, but I like harnessing thinking about the fear
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.640]   of regret as a way of identifying the differences between things.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:28.240]   So vision, regret, consequences is the next one.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.200]   I would just say – I wish I had a better, beautiful name for this – but there are
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.040]   some consequences – and here I'm mostly thinking about negative, although they can
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.920]   be both positive and negative – there are some consequences that I'm willing to accept.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.340]   So for example, losing money, losing some amount of money, I'm willing to accept it.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.160]   Losing a grade or failing a class or something, I'm willing to accept that.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.840]   Death, doing something that could result in death, I'm not really willing to accept
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.840]   it.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.560]   Divorce, not willing to do something that's going to result in that as a consequence.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.560]   There are a few others.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.040]   Bankruptcy is serious.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.200]   I'm willing to consider bankruptcy as a reasonable consequence if the benefit of success
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.880]   is big enough, but in general, if something's going to wipe me out, you generally don't
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.840]   want to do that.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.520]   And bankruptcy has a different impact depending on where you are.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.560]   If you're 20 years old and you didn't have a fortune or you're 30 years old and you
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.880]   hadn't made a fortune yet and you pursue something and you wind up bankrupt, big deal,
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.880]   not a big deal.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.920]   On the other hand, if you've got $100 million in the bank and you're 50 years old, the costs
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.200]   of going bankrupt at that time are much more significant.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.120]   And so you'll consider the costs on a varying way.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:53.000]   I guess the final one is one that I've said publicly many times, but I haven't heard
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.160]   anyone say it except I can cite where I learned it, but it just comes from Stephen Covey's
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.100]   win-win or no deal.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:05.480]   But over the years as I thought about decision-making through the lens of practicing that habit
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:13.680]   of always going for a win-win or no deal outcome, I realized that in decision-making, making
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.980]   decisions where you have one good option and a lot of bad options is easy because you just
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.580]   choose the good option.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.900]   The only thing that's hard about decision-making is either when you have multiple good options
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.420]   or you have multiple bad options.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.300]   So that's what's hard.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:36.540]   So how can you change a decision from having multiple good options to having one great
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.060]   option and no good options?
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:46.620]   Or sorry, one option that's – you need to have clear disparity of your decisions.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.340]   You're trying to choose – and so if you have decisions that are kind of similar, then
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.080]   you have to figure out how to make them different from each other so that you can differentiate
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.300]   between them.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:03.260]   Because at the time at which you have a good option or a great option as contrasted against
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.900]   non-good options, then your decision will now be easy.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.260]   So even if you have multiple good options or multiple bad options, the process is the
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.260]   same.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.900]   There's two pathways you can go down.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:23.140]   Pathway number one is you can look deeper at those decisions until you can understand
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:28.060]   more clearly what the costs and benefits of a decision are.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:33.740]   So you can say, "Well, if I go down option A, yeah, I might only be making – yeah,
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.340]   I might be making 20% less on day one, but that's going to put me in a pathway to make
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.020]   200% more on day 1,001."
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.140]   And so that's actually more alluring to me.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.180]   Or another guy might say, "You know what?
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.980]   If I go down option A, there's a good chance I might lose my job entirely, but option B
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.460]   is a much safer thing and I don't want to be without a job, so I'm going to stick
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.800]   with option B."
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:10.220]   So we try to amplify the attributes of a decision in some way until in our mind with our own
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.480]   kind of punch card, the decisions are now different.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.600]   And this is why I think you'll see people who have some maturity, they'll often just
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.200]   be very confident in their decisions.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.800]   You meet a guy who's an entrepreneur through and through and he can't imagine going back
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:31.840]   to the world of an employee because he values opportunity and freedom and flexibility, et
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.480]   cetera, more than he values perceived stability, safety, security.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.880]   Now for a limited time at Del Amo Motorsports of Orange County, get financing as low as
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:46.760]   1.99% for 36 months on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.920]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere from King of the Hammers to Uncle
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.640]   Ned's Backcountry Rally, you're not going to find a better deal on front row seats to
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.400]   a championship winner.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.400]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.360]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports of Orange County in Santa Ana and get yours.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.360]   Offer in soon.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.140]   See dealer for details.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.680]   On the other hand, there are guys who look at it and say, "Absolutely not.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:16.200]   I value stability, safety, security, and my weekends off and my evenings off, et cetera,
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.280]   much more than I value the opportunity to go big or go bust."
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.480]   And so it's just a matter of playing with the options until for you yourself, they are
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.480]   differentiated.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.440]   Now, what if you can't do that?
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.880]   What if you're looking at three options and they're still kind of all feel the same way?
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.680]   There's three cars and they're still kind of all feel the same way.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.720]   Well then I think you look for another option and you just sit tight and you drive the car
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.560]   you're driving until something comes along that's markedly better or until the circumstances
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:50.200]   in your life change and things are markedly better or different in some way.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:55.640]   And so as you go through life, things will change and things will change for you.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:01.640]   And so just sitting tight and waiting either until there's a new option that's a lot better
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.980]   or something has changed so that you're now in a different situation and can perceive
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.680]   it differently is perfectly reasonable.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:17.640]   I think that that is all of the models that come to mind right off the bat.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.440]   They're probably imperfect, but those are the best ones that I've used over the years.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.440]   Thanks.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.800]   I think maybe I didn't quite get this out of my question.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.080]   Specifically with, so as far as a big picture vision, I think I'm in a much better place
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:37.440]   than I pretty much ever have been of where I want to be three to five years from now.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.760]   And I have an idea of like, the ideal thing that I would like to do to get there is make
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:49.800]   a transition to this remote job, kind of change my career path, right?
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.000]   I'm not sure how to.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.640]   And if I could just be applying internally, which is easy, and I have time for at the
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.640]   moment.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.160]   That's why I like, you know, I can do that while I'm at work.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.280]   And no one questions me sitting over there job shopping on my company computer, you know,
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.960]   on break.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960]   So that's straightforward.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.440]   And if I could be doing that and finding out, can I just do that immediately?
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.600]   Like I kind of think I can, then, or am I actually not qualified for these jobs yet?
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.580]   I need to gain more experience.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.580]   I would do that.
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.600]   But that like, there's no, none of those jobs available right now.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.360]   So then I'm considering this alternative.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:37.480]   And it's the the time bound and lots of uncertainty, sort of a, I'm at the base of the cliff.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.920]   My goal is to climb to the top of the cliff, I could go left, or I could go right.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.560]   How do you weigh, you know, which one is going to be the easier path sort of thing?
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:53.680]   I could, like specifically this situation, probably in three weeks be working at a job
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:59.920]   that isn't really an improvement over what I'm doing is not super interesting to me,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.760]   but has a decent amount of downtime that I could spend on development work, right?
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.120]   Like there's corporate trainings I could take, there's cross functional projects I could
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.440]   volunteer for, etc, etc, that I could have time to do things that weren't in my core
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.280]   responsibilities.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.200]   I don't think I'd like that job as well.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.240]   But that would be a decent way to prepare myself.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:26.320]   Or I can hold out and keep trying for the really hard jobs that I'm barely qualified
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.000]   for, you know, I'm a good candidate, but there's somebody else that's just as good and more
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.640]   experienced in that area.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:39.760]   And that might take me months to land one of those jobs, which is that job would move
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.760]   me forward down my path.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.560]   So we're doing the training.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.560]   Does that make sense?
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.640]   Sort of the A B, which is a little better, which is a little worse, I got to decide now
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.360]   which one do I spend time on that sort of thing.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.600]   So then I think that if you go through all of that stuff that I said, you just flip a
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.440]   coin and you pick one and you go.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.560]   The key is that you're taking action.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.200]   And so I would apply for the jobs and I would set a time bound.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.000]   So meaning I would say, all right, I'm the sounds like the ideal path would be to get
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.040]   the higher, better job that I'm not sure if I'm qualified for.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   So what can I do?
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:19.160]   The first thing I would do is go and find somebody who is in that job or who is over
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.760]   that job and take that person for lunch or sit down in the office and just ask for a
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.580]   meeting and say, I want this job.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.880]   What do I need to do to be qualified for it and how can I qualify myself?
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.200]   And find out if there's a reasonable pathway to qualification for that.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.640]   And in most cases, if you just simply go to somebody who's in that job and you say, I
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.040]   want your job, how can I be, or probably slightly better, I want to be your co-worker.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.120]   I'm not sure if I'm qualified right now.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.560]   Can you tell me what I would need to do to become qualified?
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.920]   They can lay it out.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:01.200]   If a guy is working as a secretary in an attorney's office and he wants to become a paralegal,
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.040]   then all he's got to do is ask a paralegal how to do it and a few months later he can
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   be a paralegal.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.200]   If a guy is working as a paralegal and he wants to be a lawyer, all he's got to do is
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.840]   ask a lawyer how to become a lawyer and in a few years he can be a lawyer.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.640]   If a guy is a lawyer and he wants to become partner, all he's got to do is go to partner
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.440]   and ask him, what do I need to do to become partner and then do the stuff.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.320]   And so qualifications are things that can be achieved fairly quickly generally and the
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.840]   process of being ambitious and going and asking for what those necessary qualifications are
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.120]   is often an important step in bringing yourself to the notice of those who are around.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:41.640]   And so whoever is involved in that department or in that job, etc, then I would systematically
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.680]   go and make your interest known.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:49.720]   Everyone knows, I mean employers want people who want to have the job and it's hard to
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.560]   find people with motivation and so I think that shows motivation, etc.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:58.280]   Now if you find out that there's a reasonable pathway to that, then just focus on qualifying
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.960]   yourself in whatever plan you can.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:06.480]   And if you can be qualified for that within say, I don't know, three months, six months,
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.800]   whatever your timeline is and then looking forward you look at it and say, alright six
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.120]   months from now I can be qualified for it.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.080]   Meanwhile I'm going to start going out and doing my how are you's and who are you's around
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:22.040]   the company so that the people in that department know me and I'm going to apply for every one
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.840]   and I'm going to hand deliver my application and I'm going to send a box of chocolates
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.760]   and say, listen did you get my application, I really want this job.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.000]   That showing that you want a job and you want it more than another person is a really good
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.720]   qualifying thing in and of itself.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   And so maybe that works out.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.520]   If those qualifications however are beyond your window of time and you look at it and
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.320]   say, it's probably going to take me two or three years to get there and I'm not actually
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.000]   going to be qualified for the job without three years and that's not my timeline, then
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.880]   move to option B.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.920]   At the end of the day it really doesn't matter what choice you make because if you make the
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:05.760]   choice and it turns out to be the so-called wrong choice, now you'll know that it was
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.760]   the wrong choice and you would pivot back quickly.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.480]   And I think that it's more important to be speedy with making decisions so that you can
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:19.880]   gain actual data from the marketplace or from the job experience itself rather than to sit
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.000]   and to think and to think and to think and to think.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.360]   And so we want to avoid wipe out.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.640]   Again we want to avoid anything that could be completely destructive to us but as long
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.800]   as we're avoiding wipe out, just make a decision and go on.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.080]   And as soon as you make the decision, you'll probably know within very short order whether
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.760]   it was the right decision or the wrong decision because now you're not dithering about trying
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.040]   to figure out everything in your head.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.880]   You're dealing with actual results.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   Okay.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.880]   Thanks.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.760]   That makes sense.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:55.960]   I have gone out and reached out and spoken to hiring managers and I think maybe my issue
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:01.200]   with this particular decision is I think I'm very on the cusp of I'm looking at jobs that
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:07.080]   I am qualified for but there are likely many likely to be more qualified applicant than
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:12.040]   I've had that on a couple of the jobs I've been turned down for already.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.320]   We would have been very happy to hire you but this guy was three quarters of a percent
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:22.640]   better or one manager told me they basically literally said they flipped a coin and I lost.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   So yeah.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640]   Thank you.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.480]   So as far as any details of that, you're on the right track.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:36.240]   I would just add go from there and make sure that you're expressing your desire because
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:41.720]   if things are that close, I mean you know as well as anyone, if you were hiring someone
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.640]   to work beside you, you would want someone who really wants the job and so express the
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:54.080]   desire and try to do that in a stronger way in addition to just the straight out qualifications.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.480]   Kyle in the state of Washington, welcome to the show.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.320]   How can I serve you today?
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.160]   Kyle is gone.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.920]   We will wait for him to show back up.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.720]   We go to Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   Welcome to the show.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   How can I serve you today?
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.680]   Hey Josh, I appreciate you hosting the session today.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.120]   My pleasure.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.600]   I've got a question.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.920]   Overall I think my wife and I have done a pretty good job in regards to accumulating
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:28.600]   that we're focusing on income and reducing expenses but one area I have to give myself
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.840]   an F in is estate planning.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:39.400]   As a father with two younger kids, I've got a six-year-old and a nine-year-old, I want
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.400]   to make sure we have that buttoned up more.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:50.880]   The obstacle I have is that I think from a family and value standpoint we have people
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:56.920]   within our circle that we would be comfortable raising the children if something happened
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.080]   to both my wife and I.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:08.280]   But my challenge is I think as part of that conversation figuring out who to be an executor
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:15.440]   on our estate, talking finances, I would say that some of the family dynamics that would
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.640]   change a lot of things.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:25.600]   I don't think they realize maybe what we've been able to accomplish and trying to one,
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:32.440]   clean up our estate but also be sensitive to not creating other problems while I'm alive.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.800]   I don't know if you have any advice on where to start or maybe how to approach it.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:45.080]   Do you know, if you were sitting in a lawyer's office, do you know what you want to happen
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.720]   to your assets and your estate, etc.?
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.320]   Do you know how that would come about legally speaking?
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:58.760]   Philosophically, I don't know how to do it in practice but I think my kids are too young
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:06.120]   to, I would assume to directly inherit anything but if somebody would have to step in and
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:12.840]   raise them to maturity in our absence, I'd want them to obviously have the resources
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.880]   funding to be able to do that where I wasn't creating a burden on somebody else.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:24.160]   And then obviously any kind of surplus or excess be left to our children.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.640]   So I'm going to do something that always makes guys like me nervous which is to be prescriptive
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:35.280]   or just give suggestions without actually polling you for details of your estate and
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.840]   assets and things like this.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:43.680]   So I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice because a proper advisor would ask
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.800]   you a lot of questions about what you own, what you want to accomplish, etc.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:52.600]   But what I sense happens a lot of times on this topic of estate planning is simply that
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:30:01.280]   because it is so under discussed, then people don't actually know what their options are.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.840]   So I'm going to give you what I think is probably about the right solution for about 80% of
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.560]   young parents in situations perhaps like yours.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:16.600]   It's not the right solution in all situations but it's the right solution for about 80%
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.360]   of people.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:26.100]   Basically if you have a decent amount of assets and those assets can be created based on investments
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:30.320]   that you've made, those assets can be created just purely on life insurance that you have.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.840]   It's not unusual for a young father to have $3 million of life insurance.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.840]   Well guess what?
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.880]   That's a lot of money and your kids can't inherit it so you need an estate plan for
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.120]   it, etc.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.320]   And so if you've got a few million bucks or you're on your way to a few million bucks
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:48.680]   but you don't have anything that's super sticky, for example you don't own a business that
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.040]   you're a 50% interest in or something like that that requires specific planning about
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:58.240]   what would happen to the shares of the business or you're not a part of a family trust of
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.720]   some kind or a family business is passing down, etc.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.040]   You've just got some money, you've made some good financial decisions, you've accumulated
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.880]   money, it's spread across a variety of normal assets.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.720]   You have equity in your house, you have vehicles, you have 401k accounts and other retirement
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.420]   accounts, you've got some physical assets, you've got some insurance and you've got some
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.600]   other investment properties and things like that.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.160]   Let's assume that there's no special needs involved, etc.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.660]   What I think makes, and you're young, there's no reason to expect that you're going to die,
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.420]   it's just a matter of covering your bases, having a will, etc.
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.900]   The basic thing that you want to do is have two things accomplished.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:45.860]   Number one, you want to designate the ideal person that you want to be the guardian for
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:50.320]   your children and hopefully there would be a few.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.320]   Ideally you would have three.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.740]   In my will I have three.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:59.220]   If my wife and I are dead, I want this person to raise my children, to be the guardian of
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.340]   my children.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.340]   If that person is unavailable or unwilling, I want this person.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.440]   If that person is unavailable or unwilling, I want this person.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:12.980]   Just know that guardianship, you cannot force guardianship in your will, but what you can
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:18.020]   do is make it very clear what your desires and intentions are and that has a lot of weight
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:22.540]   with the court and a lot of weight with anybody who would be the guardian of your children.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.100]   So you're trying to establish who you would want to be the guardian of your children and
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:31.980]   you're trying to make that clear so that your children can be raised according to your and
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.420]   your wife's vision for them.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:40.020]   The second thing that you are trying to do is to make sure that your children are provided
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:47.780]   for financially, both while minors and also according to your wishes as adults.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.480]   So if your children were adults, it would be no problem, you could just leave your money
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:57.120]   to them or of course if you could establish certain restrictions in a trust, etc.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.140]   But the basic problem is that you've got a six-year-old and a nine-year-old and they're
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.380]   legally incompetent to inherit money, especially a lot of money.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:10.820]   And so you need somebody to care for the money and so thus you're going to need some kind
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.500]   of trust and you're going to need a trustee to care for the money.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:21.100]   And that trustee can be the same person who is the guardian, but it doesn't have to be
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.280]   the same person who is the guardian.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:29.020]   And so what I think works well for most people in your situation is simply this.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:33.160]   You decide who the guardian of your children would be.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.220]   And if you have multiple people, then you could put them in order of your preference,
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.500]   then you do that.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:45.720]   Then you decide who do I trust that would love, that loves those children and absolutely
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.620]   will do the best thing for those children.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.140]   And it doesn't have to be the guardian, but who do I trust would fight for those children's
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.180]   interest.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:59.420]   And you can designate that person as the trustee of what's going to be your family trust.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.580]   Now in some cases I think it works nicely to have a co-trustee.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:10.180]   So I don't want to go, I don't want to say what exactly I have done, but I'll just say
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:19.580]   that in many cases if the guardian of your child is a co-trustee with someone else who's
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:26.020]   not caring for the children, but who's someone else who is competent to be able to just provide
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:31.200]   supervision and make sure the children are being cared for, then that can be a nice safeguard.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.620]   Then what you do is you go to your lawyer and you have your lawyer write a will for
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:41.140]   you, and inside of your will you're going to create a testamentary trust.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:48.140]   This is a trust that only comes into being upon your death, when your last will and testament
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.140]   is opened.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:52.860]   So all the trust documents are there, but it doesn't exist, it's not funded, it's just
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.660]   sitting there in your will.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:35:02.340]   And then in that testamentary trust you simply designate the trustee or the co-trustees for
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:09.180]   your assets, and you direct that the trustee or the co-trustees are to distribute money
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:16.660]   from the trust for the support of your children and for their education and maintenance and
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.020]   support.
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:23.100]   And I think that if you have a trustee that you are confident in, then you want to give
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.720]   your trustee as much latitude as possible.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.740]   So in my own trust I have it written with a wide degree of latitude.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:34.460]   I trust my trustee, I've chosen someone that I believe will do the best, and so I want
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.060]   to give that person a wide degree of latitude.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:43.180]   And there's plenty of money there in the trust, so they don't have to shortchange it.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:48.820]   But the idea is that you want the guardian to know that the guardian can care for the
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:55.140]   children and there's going to be ample financial resources to compensate the guardian for his
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.660]   work in caring for the children.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:01.140]   So the children are not a financial burden on his finances.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.780]   And then the children are going to be properly cared for, they're going to have everything
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.540]   they need covered for education, health, maintenance, and support.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:13.380]   And then you can decide the trust terms, but what I think makes a lot of sense is give
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:21.580]   the trustee ample control to distribute for education and for maintenance and support,
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:27.020]   and then set a time, something like around the age of 30, for full disbursement of all
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:32.300]   of the trust funds directly to the beneficiary, directly to your children.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:37.900]   Then once you have that trust, then all you do is you simply go through all of your assets
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:45.300]   and you title as the beneficiary of all of your assets that have beneficiary designations
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.340]   the trust established under the will of your name.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:53.300]   And then any other assets will be handled by the will itself, and you'll direct that
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.100]   all of the assets will be put into that.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:02.420]   And then direct, you don't have to direct, but you can just give the trustee the right
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.940]   to sell property.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.900]   And then, so you would say the trustee of course can sell my real estate, et cetera,
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:12.420]   the family home, all of this stuff can be sold, all of the money can be put into the
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.420]   trust.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:19.220]   And then separate from that, you just write your own letter of intent, and just write
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.260]   your letter of instructions or letter of understanding to the trustee.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:27.900]   And this is not a binding, a legally binding thing, but is basically your way of saying,
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:34.180]   "Hey, if I died today on November 17, 2023, then I think it would make the most sense
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:40.300]   for my house to be sold and for our rental house to be sold, but I don't think it would
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:44.920]   make a lot of sense for this raw land that we have over there to be sold."
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.460]   So I would suggest that you as a trustee that you continue to own the land, but you go ahead
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.860]   and sell these other houses and turn them into cash.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.260]   Then five years from now, you just go ahead and print up a new letter and say, "Hey, I
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.340]   think now it's time that that raw land would actually be sold because of such and such."
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.600]   And again, you would probably sell it yourself if you thought it was time to be sold.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.620]   But you can write any kind of instructions like that that you want, and you can update
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.460]   those whenever you want.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:11.060]   And then your last kind of tool in the tool belt is if you feel you need it, if you're
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:16.980]   not sure who to designate as trustee or as co-trustee, then just simply hire a professional
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:25.060]   trustee and/or designate a professional trustee in your kind of third line of succession or
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.420]   something like that.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:31.580]   And so you can just hire a professional trustee who will be the steward of the accounts.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:36.020]   And the fees are reasonable, and you'll know that there's a professional who's looking
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.740]   out for the interests of my children.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:44.260]   And at the end of the day, if any of the people, the individuals that you have selected are
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.420]   not willing to serve, then that's taken care of.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.700]   And then does that make sense to you?
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.220]   That something like something would be helpful for you?
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.980]   Yeah, that was very helpful.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.160]   I wasn't familiar with that type of trust.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:07.380]   When it comes to a professional trustee, would that typically be somebody that a law firm
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:12.120]   could refer me to, or where do you go looking for someone of that?
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.540]   It's a professional service.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:18.500]   So you have all these big firms you've heard of, or maybe like Northern Trust or Bessemer
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.220]   Trust or whatnot.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:24.300]   There's these trust companies that quite literally, this is what they do.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:28.140]   They are professional trustees, professional money managers, et cetera.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:35.380]   It doesn't have to be one of those big expensive firms, but it will often be somebody who does
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.500]   their job as a professional trustee.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.180]   It can be a lawyer.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:44.940]   It can be a financial advisor, or it can be somebody who actually does this as a job.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.800]   You don't have to designate that.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.780]   But yes, your lawyer will have, when you sit with your lawyer and you say, "Could you recommend
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.780]   someone?"
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.980]   Your lawyer will have a long list of people that he works with that he can confirm and
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.900]   say, "Hey, this would be a great person for you to consider."
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:02.780]   And actually, it doesn't have to be specified in the documents.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:07.260]   You just indicate that there needs to be a professional trustee, and then the people
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:11.980]   who are involved with your estate, your executor, et cetera, they'll go through the process
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.540]   of finding a professional trustee to serve if your previous trustees are unwilling to
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.540]   serve.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.540]   >>Trevor: Okay.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.260]   So it doesn't need to be on retainer or anything.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.900]   It's really just kind of as needed basis.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:24.900]   Okay.
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:31.100]   >>Josh: In my trust, I have this person as primary co-trustees, these two people.
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:37.580]   I have the guardian of my children and another trusted person as co-trustees at the first
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.580]   level.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.900]   I trust the people that I'm choosing.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.460]   So here's always this balance with legal documents.
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:53.460]   The legal document is not actually necessary if you're dealing with people who are trustworthy.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:58.640]   But if you're dealing with people who are untrustworthy, the legal document is not sufficient
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.460]   to control them.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:05.620]   So the legal document in some sense is pointless because trustworthy people will do the right
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:11.460]   thing and untrustworthy people will probably try to do the wrong thing regardless of what
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.020]   happens with the legal document.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:18.980]   But what the legal document does is it gives formal power to certain people and to the
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:26.740]   court to make sure that there's sanctions in place if people act wrongly.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:32.200]   And so I want to give maximum latitude to the guardian of my children.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:38.540]   But I also want there to be a legal sanction there, somebody else who is involved, who
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.340]   is able to supervise things.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:45.620]   And I want the court to be able to hold those persons responsible for acting in the best
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.500]   interest of my people, my children.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:54.660]   So that's why we have the court documents in place, is they just provide a legal mechanism
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:42:01.140]   that somebody can be prosecuted, control can be done, legal documents can be created, etc.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:06.940]   And those people have the right to do that with the document.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:11.420]   And then just one last clarification for the execution on this.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:16.980]   In naming the trust a beneficiary, that would be a secondary beneficiary, right?
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.340]   And I would still have my wife be primary?
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.340]   Right.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.340]   Exactly.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:25.940]   Now, for a limited time at Del Amo Motorsports of Orange County, get financing as low as
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:31.620]   1.99% for 36 months on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:36.020]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere from King of the Hammers to Uncle
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:40.780]   Ned's Backcountry Rally, you're not going to find a better deal on front row seats to
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.540]   a championship winner.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.220]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:49.260]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports of Orange County in Santa Ana and get yours.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.180]   Offer in soon, see dealer for details.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.180]   Exactly.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:58.340]   And so usually you and your wife will have a mirror will and testament, mirror will and
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.340]   trusts.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:03.220]   So all of the provisions of it will be the same except flipped.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:08.020]   And then all of the primary beneficiaries on all of your accounts will be your wife.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:12.820]   She will have all of your money if you're dead, and she'll take care of the children.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:20.200]   And then it's only the trusts only come into action if both you and your wife die simultaneously
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.380]   or within short order and she hasn't changed the affairs.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.660]   That makes sense.
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.140]   Awesome, Josh.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.340]   Very helpful.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.860]   I appreciate it.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:30.900]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:39.460]   And so to cover myself and to be professionally appropriate, like this is just a general outline.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:46.500]   Your lawyer's job is to engage in more specific fact finding, more specific discussion of
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.620]   appropriate options for you, deal with any specific relationships and things like that
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:55.100]   that you yourself might be worried about.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.580]   But a lot of times you're just confused because you don't know what the options are.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:03.540]   And what I've described I think is probably the best option for about 80% of people in
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.980]   the life stage that you are.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:09.420]   And I want to say quickly and clearly, this will be different when you're 60 years old.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.180]   Things will be very different when you're 60 years old.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.300]   You have a different set of considerations, et cetera.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.300]   But for young parents who are just saying, "I know I need to get a will because I want
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.420]   to establish the guardianship of my children, but I don't know how to do it and I ought
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:23.860]   to know something about it," what I've described will I think work about 80% of the time.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.020]   All right, we move on.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.020]   We'll go back to Kyle.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.700]   Kyle in Washington, are you there this time?
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.420]   Man, I got so nervous I just hung right up on you.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.780]   I have that effect.
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:33.780]   Usually it's...
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.580]   I'll skip the rest of the joke.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.580]   Welcome.
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.580]   We're glad you're here.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:42.740]   So these have been great questions.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:46.620]   I've got some pretty kindergarten-y stuff to ask in comparison today.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.620]   I just...
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.860]   I periodically go to your Twitter and scroll through a month or two of your posting, and
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.100]   I don't like to interact on the computer.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:59.940]   I just have a Twitter account to read you and a handful of other folks.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:04.140]   But I've got a handful of what I hope could be rapid fire questions.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.580]   I don't know if you'll let me do that.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.580]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.900]   I think it'd be fun.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:10.900]   One quick comment, though.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:17.580]   A handful of Q&A shows ago, a guy called and was worried about AI being the next nuclear
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.460]   bomb and how scary it all was.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.300]   And your guy, Jack Spierko, had an episode on...
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:30.260]   Kind of right after I heard him expresses his fears.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.860]   And he talked about AI as being a weapon.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.140]   And if your enemy has a weapon and you don't have that weapon to be able to utilize in
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:41.940]   the same fashion as your enemy, then you're doing yourself a disservice.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.100]   So instead of sticking your head in the sand and ostriching away from it, you should turn
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.380]   to it and utilize it for what it's good for.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.940]   And I thought that was a good way...
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.860]   You try looking at things positively, and I thought that was a good way to...
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:00.660]   It's a pessimistic view still, but it's a good way to wrap your head around what the
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:04.660]   real threats are is by learning what it is and getting involved.
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.500]   And I thought that was kind of neat.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.220]   I love what you just described.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.340]   I think that's a great point that Jack made.
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:13.340]   Absolutely.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.780]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:20.660]   One thing you posted about human foot-shaped footwear.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:25.820]   There was some guy on there that was putting up all these different shoe brands.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:32.140]   I'm a similar height to you, and I think we have the same size foot.
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:33.380]   I'm running a size 16.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:37.740]   And I'm curious what kind of shoes you're finding that are good for your feet.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.540]   Right now I'm using an Ultra because it's the only company I can find that makes a shoe
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.580]   that shape that big.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.820]   I do not have any currently.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.580]   I do not have any barefoot shoes.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:54.660]   I have tried to buy them a couple times, and due to the size of my feet, they're just not
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.020]   available.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.980]   Except for one that I think you – I assume you probably just mentioned that I've been
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.740]   intending to check out.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:11.380]   My embrace of the kind of barefoot shoe thing is simply involved just primarily trying to
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.740]   be barefoot at most times.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:19.580]   And so I try to do all of my walking, do my 10,000 steps barefoot.
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.380]   I try to do my running and my sprints barefoot.
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:28.940]   I try to just be barefoot more and more, and I don't have currently any barefoot shoes.
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:33.700]   I have been intending to get more deeply into it, like getting the toe spacers and the toe
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.740]   socks and everything like that.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.220]   Since I don't live in the US, I can't get that stuff easily.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.340]   If I were in the United States, I would have the whole stuff.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:45.420]   But because I have to plan ahead and buy it all and pick it up when I go into the US,
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.040]   then it's just one of those things that just hasn't been a big priority.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:54.180]   So mostly I just try to be barefoot as much as I can, and then the rest of the time I
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.740]   just wear normal shoes.
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.460]   But I am conscious of it.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:03.820]   I've wanted to get my children into – kind of the same actionable thing with my children
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:07.780]   is that I just try to encourage them to be barefoot most of the time.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.820]   And I don't have a whole suite of barefoot shoes for them.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:19.020]   Primarily the cost, like you go out and you think about paying 80 bucks, 60 bucks, 70
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:24.420]   bucks times five every time you need shoes, and then three months later they've outgrown
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:25.420]   them.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:29.460]   And so I've just mostly just encouraged my children to be barefoot.
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.900]   And I hope that's good enough.
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:34.620]   So I'm not a purist on that topic, though the barefoot stuff makes a lot of sense to
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.620]   me.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.620]   Right.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.780]   Yeah, I know my kid uses his shoes for bike breaks.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:44.140]   It's pretty hard to justify a hundred-dollar bike break like that.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.020]   Yeah, I've got to step up my barefoot game.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.860]   I haven't been doing that.
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.380]   What about our prepper menu?
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:55.780]   So you've talked about in the past working out a more healthy prepper menu.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:01.860]   And I think about this, you know, we have food if we need it, and it's not the greatest.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.060]   And you know, we don't feel great when we eat it as a family.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.340]   Typically we don't eat beans and rice all the time.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.660]   And you know, is there any place you would go?
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.980]   I know you say you've been out of that kind of for a while.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:22.540]   But you know, aside from buying a great big freeze dryer and making my own, you know,
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.540]   what do you do?
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:29.220]   Eat versus donate, I guess, is my question there.
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:32.940]   You know, if I'm just going to have these beans and rice laying around, do I just donate
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:37.260]   them every five years and buy new beans and rice and I end up never touching it?
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.760]   Yes.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:44.000]   So I would say I think I kind of think of this as a barbell strategy in the world of
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.140]   food prepping.
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:56.180]   First I think there's a scale and by scale I mean a continuum.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:03.860]   And it seems like a lot of people want to get the best thing for all circumstances and
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.700]   it's not possible.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:11.820]   So if you want, for example, the cheapest prepper food, the cheapest prepper food is
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:18.580]   going to be to buy bulk wheat, bulk corn, bulk beans and bulk rice to get mylar bags,
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:23.060]   seal them up yourself and set them away in five gallon buckets.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:27.620]   That's going to be your cheapest way to get huge amounts of calories stored for the long
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:28.900]   term.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:34.060]   The problem is that the majority of us don't eat that ever, like really ever.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:39.060]   And so one of the challenges, it's always been a challenge with preparedness food, has
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.620]   been teaching people how to even use this stuff.
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:47.020]   I did it once as an experiment I guess with like wheat berries and making a wheat berry
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.020]   gruel.
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:51.900]   But the classic thing with wheat berries is people don't have a grinder, nobody bakes
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:52.900]   bread, et cetera.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.940]   And so we just don't eat this stuff.
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:59.580]   So yeah, it's bulk calories but there's a whole skill set associated with actually acquiring
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.980]   it and using it.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:05.960]   The technological revolution for long term storage food has been the freeze dried food.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.940]   And freeze dried foods are great.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.540]   They're tasty.
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:13.140]   They are relatively nutritious.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:16.340]   They at least have calories and they last for 30 years.
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:20.620]   The problem with the freeze dried food is usually the cost, that they're substantially
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.740]   more expensive than just stocking up on calories.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:28.300]   And so you have to ask yourself, am I the kind of guy who has the money that I can just
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:33.140]   go and buy freeze dried food and set it away for 30 years and forget about it?
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:38.140]   Or am I the kind of guy who needs to develop the skills so that I can't solve with money?
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:43.140]   I have frequently recommended with private consulting clients, guys who, I'm not saying
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:48.500]   you're a centimillionaire, but there's a lot of guys who just need to go to Costco and
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:55.460]   buy a pallet and spend $8,000 or $10,000 and buy a pallet of freeze dried food from Costco
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.740]   or whatever it is and just literally buy the freeze dried food, put it in a dark room in
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.420]   a safe place and forget about it.
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.020]   And at least you know I'm done with that.
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:08.220]   Now is that true preparedness in the sense that you've learned how to be self-reliant
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.220]   and self-sufficient for a 30 year great collapse?
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:18.300]   No, but it's a tremendously valuable insurance policy and the cost of it over the next 30
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.540]   years will become totally negligible as compared to the peace of mind.
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:27.900]   And so I think that if, as long as someone is not completely broke, that freeze dried
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:33.740]   food, substantial quantities of it, just bought from any of the large number of excellent
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:36.660]   people selling it is great.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:41.860]   And of course you should do a little bit of practice with it, buy some, use some, etc.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:45.300]   But that's your fast way to spend money to solve the problem.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:50.660]   The flip side is I think you have the standard thing of a deep pantry.
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:54.700]   That's not that hard to do of just buying a little bit extra of the stuff that you do
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:53:00.380]   and that's not going to get you to years of preparedness, but it will get you to a few
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.580]   months of preparedness of food.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:07.660]   And then for health food, I think the secret is chest freezers and lots of frozen meat
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:10.140]   and frozen other stuff as well, but frozen meat.
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.300]   I think that's where your health food is.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.560]   And so if you have a couple of extra chest freezers and you have a generator and some
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.700]   way of keeping those freezers going, then that's where I think your deep stock of health
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.700]   food is.
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.620]   I consider meat to be the primary health food.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:31.620]   I could exist completely healthily on nothing except meat and meat has the unique benefit
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:38.220]   of lasting for quite a long time frozen and we can use it regularly from a frozen state.
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:43.700]   And so if you just have an extra chest freezer or a couple of extra chest freezers and you
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:48.480]   have some fuel source to keep them going, so some guys will have one propane chest freezer
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:55.220]   and one electric chest freezer with a generator to power it or some version like that, then
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:56.420]   just fill them full of meat.
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:00.580]   And if you've got $5,000 worth of meat in your freezer, you've got a couple of months
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:08.220]   of stuff, of food, of high quality health food.
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:11.940]   And I think that with those two things put, actually I guess I said three things, but
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:16.700]   those three things put together, a stock of freeze dried food set aside somewhere that
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.740]   you're probably never going to touch, it's going to sit there and 45 years from now it's
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.580]   going to be thrown away.
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:25.780]   And then a deep pantry that's a few months worth and then a good supply of meat in the
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:30.060]   freezer, you've got great health food that's going to last you for a long time.
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.740]   There's a lot more that can be done.
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:38.220]   My friend Stephen Harris has this info product that he sells on how to preserve eggs for
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.260]   years at a time.
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:44.540]   And so you go and have buckets full of eggs preserved in a, I think it's a lime solution
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:45.700]   and it works great.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:49.920]   Like all the stuff works, but a lot of that, that pepper stuff just becomes a hassle.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.340]   And so what I've described is the lowest hassle for a medium cost.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:58.980]   And I think that works for a lot of people, the beans and the corn and all that I think
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.580]   is great also.
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:01.580]   And there's two ways.
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:06.620]   So if somebody has the energy to go and do that, great, you can order a lot of that stuff
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.060]   pre-prepared if you know how to, if you know how to use it.
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:14.380]   The other thing that makes, that I think makes sense is just if you're, if you're uniquely
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:18.700]   concerned about a crisis, then just go and stock up more of it.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.100]   And so the classic one that I recommend is just corn.
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:27.780]   You know, you can, Harris is the one who taught me all the corn stuff, but he does all this
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:32.560]   stuff with corn, teaches you how to use it and make food with it and whatnot.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.660]   And so you can just go to tractor supply.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:38.260]   If there's a, if there's some kind of thing that you're worried about, then just have
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.500]   on your mental checklist, first place I'm going to go is tractor supply and I'm going
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:45.940]   to get 30 bags of feed corn and that 30 bags of feed corn is going to last you through
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:51.540]   the, you know, for a couple of years with no special preservation, no buckets and mylar
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.300]   bags and things like that.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.940]   But it gives you the ability to feed your neighbors and feed your neighborhood.
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:00.580]   And if, if, if you don't use it, then the cost is so cheap that you're out a few hundred
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.820]   bucks and you feed the deer.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.420]   I guess not that big of a deal.
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:08.220]   So I think that, you know, I don't have 50 gallon, five gallon buckets of stuff in my
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.220]   house.
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:12.500]   If I lived in a place where I could have it, I would probably want it.
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:17.380]   But I think that I think of it like a barbell strategy, a stock of freeze dried stuff, a
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.180]   heavy pantry and heavy meat in the refrigerator.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.420]   That's the health food for virtually all things.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:29.700]   And the real reality is the idea of not being able to buy food for years at a time is, is
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.260]   pretty unlikely.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:36.580]   And so for many people, especially in the United States, you know, food shortages, crises,
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:40.660]   things like that, they're going to be short to medium term things.
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.920]   And you can, and it's not that nothing is available.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:48.100]   It's just that maybe not everything that you previously used was available.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:53.860]   So as Spirico used to point out, if you've got three months worth of food storage, realistically
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:58.300]   that three months could probably be pretty easily turned into six months just with stocking
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:00.540]   up half time at the grocery store.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.300]   And so it's not an all or nothing thing.
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:06.780]   You're not, we're not, we're not going to live in a, in a world in which today everything
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:07.780]   stops.
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:11.220]   We sit in our homes and eat nothing but stored food for three years and then emerge like
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:12.220]   that.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:16.300]   Just not, I can't, I can't come up with an event in which that actually is the case.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.700]   Yeah, it happens on TV, right?
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:19.700]   Not in practice.
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:20.700]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:21.700]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.980]   And I, we're already kind of doing that, right?
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:26.980]   I mean, that's a heavy pantry in a freezer full of food is, is just a cost effective
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.100]   way to exist as far as I can tell.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:39.860]   And so, yeah, like you say, adding to the barbell is a good, good way to go about it.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:46.260]   I read a lot of Peter Zahan's books at your recommendation probably five, six months ago.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:51.480]   For some investment questions that I had and I'm looking, having difficulty finding counter
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:54.460]   opinions to him that are reputable.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:58:00.540]   And I'm curious if you, who, who have you read that carries a lot of weight in that
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:09.700]   space and may or may not agree fully with what Mr. Zahan has proposes probably in our
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.180]   future as a globe.
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:12.740]   And then I'll stop with the rapid fire stuff.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:18.660]   The most interesting one was that I saw Zahan himself say that he had, was doing a debate
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:20.780]   with Ray Dalio.
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:26.020]   I haven't seen the, I haven't seen any video or audio of that, but I would look forward
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.740]   to, to that.
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:30.260]   Short answer is I have not found.
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:34.500]   So the problem, here's the problem I have with Zahan.
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:41.860]   I kind of feel like he is a, an enormous cheerleader of the United States.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:47.460]   And I kind of feel like he's on the CIA payroll because as somebody said to me, like, you
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:52.060]   know, the stuff he says, the stuff he says is basically an American politician's wet
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.060]   dream.
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:58.740]   You know, it's like rah, rah, rah, US is so well positioned, everywhere else is terrible
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:58:59.740]   and whatnot.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:04.620]   So I kind of have this feeling that, especially given his background, you know, being involved
[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:10.980]   in those circles and, and his work in DC and his work in years past, I almost feel like
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:15.700]   he's got a nice check that clears every month from the CIA or from the, some, you know,
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:16.780]   political group or something.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:20.040]   So that he just keeps saying nice things about the United States.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:27.860]   But the problem is that he backs all this stuff up with data and I can't find a, a compelling
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:31.540]   data driven, you know, alternative to that.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:36.260]   There are a few people who ideologically don't agree with him.
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:42.260]   Zion basically waves his hand and discounts anything kind of culture related.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:48.620]   He's very dismissive of, of anything culture war related.
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:55.060]   And I think, you know, fine that to a degree, like certainly geography is probably more
[00:59:55.060 --> 01:00:02.940]   important than culture in many cases, but you know, culture wars often turn into actual
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.940]   wars.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.060]   And so who knows?
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:09.060]   But I feel like that's a weak point that he just kind of glosses over that and doesn't
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.260]   give a lot of credit to that.
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:18.540]   I find it interesting and slightly maddening how he never talks about, he doesn't spend
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:22.700]   much time in any of his books talking about structures of government.
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.240]   Does government matter, right?
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:32.100]   Is there actually benefit in the, the, the concept of, of a democratic republic, an experiment
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:36.820]   in, in, you know, liberty and ordered liberty like the United States is, or was just all
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.820]   geography?
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:42.820]   I, I wish he would deal with that a little bit, but, but I don't have, there are not
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:48.140]   a lot of people who, who just, who, who derive data.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.940]   Most of the time I look for his haters and most of the time it's just an emotional reaction.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:59.700]   And I, so this is a rambling way of saying I can't cite a single name specifically that,
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:06.300]   that I would say is, is kind of someone who is writing in contra to him.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.700]   Now I have not looked in the last few months, maybe something has been developed in the
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.100]   last few months.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:18.860]   What I do think is interesting is to spend some time imagining the world on the other
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.100]   side of the nation state.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:28.300]   And so I've always thought that the writers of, hold on, let me look, have you ever read
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:38.460]   The Sovereign Individual with James David, here we go, come on, auto correct doing its
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.860]   job again.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.480]   So there's a book, it's 15 years old, called The Sovereign Individual, Mastering the Transition
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:50.400]   to the Information Age by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Reese Mogg.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.660]   It's an old book, but I think it's still a timely book.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:02:04.460]   And one of the things that, that as a primary lens of analysis that those authors use is
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:08.500]   basically the logic of violence.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:16.020]   And the basic point, it's a hefty, hefty book, so it's hard for me to summarize it, but one
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:22.540]   of their biggest points is they talk about how the logic of violence is basically an
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:27.300]   inescapable point of analysis.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:38.380]   And they describe how in different phases, based upon this transition, based upon the
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.420]   tools of violence, et cetera, you have different phases.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:50.540]   And I have, years ago, flippantly I used to say, oh, the nation state is only a temporary
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:57.460]   thing, but I didn't have a clear alternative for it.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:03.500]   And it's something that we're so accustomed to thinking of the nation state as supreme
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:09.300]   that it's very hard for us to even visualize something other than the nation state.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:14.500]   The whole concept of the nation state is so built into our mode of thinking, and it's
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:20.140]   done that way by those who want to see the nation state continue.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.780]   They're trying to keep it going, so they want it to be.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:28.980]   But the point of the nation state is that it's only a solution for certain things at
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.580]   a certain time.
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:34.260]   And I'm desperately flipping to try to get my copy of The Sovereign Individual open so
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:42.020]   I can read to you something from it, because it talks about the stages.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:48.900]   And so here is, I'll just read slightly from the introduction, because they do a good job
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.900]   of this.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.580]   So here we go.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.860]   The fourth stage of human society.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:58.400]   The theme of this book is the new revelation of power, which is liberating individuals
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.860]   at the expense of the 20th century nation state.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:08.260]   By the way, again, this book was written in 2000, released in 2000, so more than 15 years,
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.140]   23 years old.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:14.300]   Innovations that alter the logic of violence in unprecedented ways are transforming the
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.660]   boundaries within which the future must lie.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:22.140]   If our deductions are correct, you stand at the threshold of the most sweeping revolution
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.820]   in history.
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:30.140]   Faster than all but a few now imagine, microprocessing will subvert and destroy the nation state,
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:33.320]   creating new forms of social organization in the process.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.300]   This will be far from an easy transformation.
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:40.100]   The challenge it will pose will be all the greater because it will happen with incredible
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:44.080]   speed compared with anything seen in the past.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.700]   Through all of human history, from its earliest beginnings until now, there have been only
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:51.900]   three basic stages of economic life.
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:54.540]   One, hunting and gathering societies.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.960]   Two, agricultural societies.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.340]   And three, industrial societies.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:06.380]   Now looming over the horizon is something entirely new, the fourth stage of social organization,
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.140]   information societies.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.900]   Each of the previous stages of society has corresponded with distinctly different phases
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.980]   in the evolution and control of violence.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:21.540]   As we explain in detail, information societies promise to dramatically reduce the returns
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:27.260]   to violence in part because they transcend locality.
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:33.620]   The virtual reality of cyberspace, what novelist William Gibson characterized as "a consensual
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:39.640]   hallucination" will be as far beyond the reach of bullies as imagination can take it.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.500]   In the new millennium, the advantage of controlling violence on a large scale will be far lower
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:48.780]   than it has been at any time since before the French Revolution.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.380]   This will have profound consequences.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.580]   One of these will be rising crime.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:58.580]   When the payoff for organizing violence at a large scale tumbles, the payoff from violence
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.580]   at a smaller scale is likely to jump.
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:04.780]   Violence will become more random and localized.
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.540]   Organized crime will grow in scope.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.260]   We explain why.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:13.180]   Another logical implication of falling returns to violence is the eclipse of politics, which
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:16.220]   is the stage for crime on the largest scale.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:20.340]   There is much evidence that adherence to the civic myths of the 20th century nation-state
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.460]   is rapidly eroding.
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.780]   The death of communism is merely the most striking example.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:30.200]   As we explore in detail, the collapse of morality and growing corruption among leaders of Western
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.660]   governments are not random developments.
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:36.480]   They are evident that the potential of the nation-state is exhausted.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.820]   And many of its leaders no longer believe the platitudes they mouth, nor are they believed
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.100]   by others.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:46.020]   So I would read the whole book to you if I could, but it's a great book and I would
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.500]   commend it to you.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:52.380]   But it's, I think, one of the more interesting comments on this.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:56.580]   And I think that if you haven't read it, this is a good time to read it, because the predictions
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.140]   of it are 23 years in the past.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:02.980]   And yet they've held up broadly quite well.
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:08.160]   And what's interesting to me is that when I consider the changes that have happened
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:19.380]   in society, in my experience of it, it very much reflects some of these macro trends that
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:26.280]   Reese and whatever his name is, predicted way back in the year 2000.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:32.140]   And it's left me, and I think a lot of people, with a great deal of uncertainty.
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:36.880]   And so I've been talking recently publicly about why I left the United States.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:45.420]   And it's been a very strange emotional process for me, because I identified deeply with what
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.980]   it meant to be an American.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:50.760]   And I watched my country completely change and transform.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.200]   And I've observed that there are a couple of things that have happened.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.720]   I'm stereotyping broadly.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:02.460]   But there are some people, most people, have just simply changed their politics, their
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:03.620]   ideas completely.
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:09.820]   In the 20 years that I've been paying attention to politics, there has been almost a complete
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:15.900]   flip-flop on so many issues between right-wing and left-wing people.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:16.900]   And not on all.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:20.960]   Obviously, there's distinctions between the political parties.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:25.820]   But the Republicans of today don't believe what the Republicans of a decade ago said
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:26.820]   they believed.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:31.200]   And the Democrats of today don't believe what the Democrats of a decade ago believed.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.300]   And my question has always been, why?
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.500]   What happened?
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:38.180]   Because I thought I understood politics, and then politics completely transformed underneath
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.180]   me.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:42.980]   And to me, it makes more sense that some of these things are happening in terms of these
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:44.300]   trends.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:48.560]   And a lot of them are being driven by the information age and the information revolution.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:56.340]   And so to me, the sovereign individual has been always a useful pathway through that.
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:09:00.380]   And yet it deals with things that Zion doesn't talk about.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.860]   He basically assumes static, continual change.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:14.060]   He doesn't, in his analysis, I haven't seen any integration of dynamic events.
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.140]   And he also does everything.
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:23.140]   He uses politics and geography as his primary.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.940]   Demographics and geography are his big tools.
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:31.180]   But I think that there needs to be some conversation about the nation state itself, and are there
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.220]   things to do that.
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.100]   So if I were having dinner with him, that's what I would ask him about.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.100]   I'm certain he has thought about it.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:40.260]   He just hasn't written about it, nor have I found him talking about it.
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:44.140]   So if I were interviewing him, or if I were having dinner with him, those are the things
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.900]   that I would probe him on.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:48.100]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.820]   My wife and I were talking about that very thing.
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:59.180]   How do you reconcile the leader of the communist world coming to California and everybody going
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:04.780]   and shaking hands with the guy versus what if we didn't do business with them?
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.300]   What does that look like with our culture the way it is?
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:11.340]   Who starts the manufacturing back up if we quit doing business entirely?
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.580]   That type of thing.
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:16.180]   Those type of questions are really hard to answer.
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:19.180]   And then you look at Zion, and I don't know.
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:27.500]   There's these big gaping, maybe not big gaping gaps in his logic or what he decides to analyze,
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.540]   but what else is he missing?
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:35.220]   I don't see anybody dropping big chunks of what he's missed in front of me.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.500]   So I appreciate the recommendation.
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:44.980]   I think it's good to look and obviously try and if it's something you agree with, turn
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:45.980]   it upside down.
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.740]   And if you're just trying to learn, then you should do the same thing.
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:49.740]   Right, right.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.060]   Shake it out and see if it holds up.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:56.100]   There are other people, just to be clear, there are other people who write on some of
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.100]   these topics.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:58.820]   I haven't read all of them.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:10:59.820]   I've read some of them.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:05.660]   I think Tim Marshall's book, Prisoners of Geography, I put that into our homeschool
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.060]   curriculum.
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:10.340]   My son, my eldest, just read that last semester.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:12.380]   I think that's interesting.
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:16.020]   I've been reading a couple of Jared Diamond's books.
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:20.820]   I read his book Crisis a couple years ago, and I'm in the process of reading Guns, Germs,
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.500]   and Steel, which I never read.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.700]   It's an interesting perspective.
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.540]   Neil Ferguson is interesting.
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.740]   Ian Bremmer has some books that are on my list.
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.540]   I haven't read his stuff yet.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:34.820]   I've read all of George Friedman's books.
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:40.140]   Friedman, Zeyhan used to work for Friedman, and I like Friedman's stuff.
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:43.140]   It's in many ways very similar to Zeyhan.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:47.580]   So those are interesting, you know, it's an interesting space.
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:53.300]   It's a very unique space, that idea of predicting the future, because you can pretty much say
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.380]   and do what you want.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:56.260]   People see what they want to believe.
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:12:05.340]   I respect Zeyhan enormously for his defense, robust defense with good data of his events.
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:11.500]   But I continue to believe, I believe that number one, people can change, and number
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:18.500]   two, I believe that God is in control, sovereignly ordering things according to his macro plan.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:24.900]   So that religious dimension is an element that certainly Zeyhan gives no accounting
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.420]   to whatsoever, but that I myself do.
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.900]   So those are my comments.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:29.900]   Anything else?
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.900]   We finished the rest of your questions, or do you have anything else?
[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:34.900]   I don't know, I mean, they're kind of geeky.
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:35.900]   Go ahead.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:36.900]   What do I have on here?
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:42.940]   These tweets, Fred, sometimes you put up, there was a really good one about this guy
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:49.980]   who was smoking a lot of pot, and then he chronicled how he'd quit and all the effects
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:53.220]   that it had on him and his family, and it was fantastic.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:57.300]   And I wanted to share it with everybody I knew that picks the pipe up, and man alive,
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.300]   it got deleted.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.180]   Is that the nature of Twitter?
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.180]   I don't spend a lot of time.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.180]   It is the nature of Twitter.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.180]   It happens.
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.180]   It is, and I've done it myself.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.800]   It's so unfortunate.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.940]   When you start getting attention, it's overwhelming.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:14.460]   It's funny because I guess some people like going viral.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:21.020]   I've gone viral twice, and both times I've ended up deleting the threads because it was
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:25.300]   just so uncomfortable to be the subject of a firestorm.
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:31.540]   It's so different than anything that you are accustomed to.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:35.460]   And so if there's anything good, you always have to save it and screenshot it of the stuff
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:36.820]   that you want.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:38.460]   But that issue – Yeah, I love to learn.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:44.220]   I am fascinated with that issue, and I have been rethinking – with the issue of marijuana
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.700]   specifically, just drugs specifically.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:53.820]   I'm really interested – I've been kind of trying to figure out what do I believe
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:54.820]   on that subject.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.980]   I've gone on various sides of it.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:03.140]   When I was younger, I was like, "Well, of course drugs should be criminalized."
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:08.780]   Then I got into the libertarian stuff, and it's like, "Well, who's harmed, et cetera?"
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:14.340]   And then you look – one of the things that's been interesting is that since in my lifetime,
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:20.260]   when most of those – we've watched – the whole trend has been towards legalization
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:27.340]   of marijuana broadly, and more important than legalization, broad-scale acceptance of marijuana,
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.780]   and then also legalization of many other drugs.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:34.180]   I have a hard time saying anything good about anything that's happened in the United States
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.180]   with that.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:40.140]   You travel across the country, and I mean, it's a hellscape in many places, and it's
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.100]   not just San Francisco, right?
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:45.500]   You go to the deep south and some of these towns that have been just destroyed, you look
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:50.020]   at all the stuff that's happened right now with the fentanyl crisis, et cetera, and it's
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.300]   crazy to me.
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:57.140]   And so I certainly don't hold to the libertarian position anymore.
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:01.020]   I keep my mouth shut generally, but it's fascinating to watch.
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:06.420]   And just this week, speaking of interesting things, just this week I was watching – there's
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:16.460]   been some video come out of a recent thing that Peter Hitchens, the UK columnist, did.
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:18.500]   You know Peter Hitchens, Christopher Hitchens' brother?
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.500]   Yeah.
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.180]   Okay, so Peter – I love Peter.
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.180]   I love Christopher.
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.180]   Christopher was awesome.
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:27.300]   He was my favorite fiery atheist debater.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:32.740]   Peter is his brother, and Peter is equally fiery, but in a totally different way.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:36.080]   He's a Christian, but most of his stuff is political.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:44.020]   So he signed up for this thing where they put him into prison, and it was for a TV show,
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:48.100]   but they sent him to prison for three days in like a mock environment for him to experience
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.140]   this.
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:55.320]   And so there was this video of him that was widely seen where he's sitting there debating
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:59.600]   a bunch of ex-cons who were in this prison experiment with him, and he's saying how
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.500]   he believes that marijuana is the most dangerous drug.
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:11.360]   And I find this very fascinating because I have come to hate marijuana because of the
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:17.680]   destruction that it wreaks on the people of destroying their ambition, etc.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.760]   But I've kind of swallowed the line that, okay, at the end of the day it's probably
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.760]   less destructive than alcohol.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.880]   And so just this week I was saying I need to read what Hitchens has written on this
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.440]   and see what he cites because it was just a fascinating argument that we're having
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.160]   right now.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:40.440]   And I guess to me the biggest frustration to me has been the widespread acceptance of
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:44.520]   marijuana and drugs in our society because I've watched it happen.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:53.200]   I have a friend of mine who is kind of a semi-retired 60-something guy, and he was always an ambitious
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.200]   go-getter.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.260]   He was a professional athlete at one time, go-getting business guy.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:04.540]   He was kind of a conservative, not super-political, but conservative anti-pot kind of guy.
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:07.980]   He started smoking pot, and now he just smokes pot every day.
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:12.580]   And it just seems like such a waste to me that we allow that stuff to destroy the potential
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:13.580]   of our society.
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.780]   But thankfully I don't have to make any public policy on it.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:20.620]   - Yeah, people aren't very honest about what it really does, I don't think.
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:22.180]   They say, "Oh yeah, what's the difference?
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:26.540]   If you do that or do some beer, well, I'll tell you there's a big difference."
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.380]   People start out their day and end their evening with that stuff.
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:32.020]   They don't typically do that with liquor.
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:35.740]   You can abuse anything, but man alive.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:37.420]   That was a really good tweet thread.
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.380]   I'm going to have to start screenshotting if I want to share stuff like that.
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:46.060]   Anyhow, all right, good lesson.
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:47.060]   Appreciate it.
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.060]   - Yeah.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.060]   Last one.
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:50.060]   - Yeah.
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.060]   Back books.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.740]   You heard your back a while.
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:57.580]   I listened to everything you ever said and then I bring up these little tiny things way
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:58.700]   after you mentioned it.
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.820]   So I don't expect you to remember, but you talked about, "Hey, I hurt my back and it
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:04.180]   laid me up and it really depressed me.
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.580]   And I decided I can't be depressed about this.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.220]   I need to get up and get after it."
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.420]   But it takes a lot out of your sales.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.420]   And I had the same thing.
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:18.500]   I went from blue collar to white collar to blue collar and I hurt my back and I read
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.940]   a bunch of books about it.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:25.420]   And I'm just curious, I read Dr. Stuart McGill's books and wrote her book.
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:30.540]   He's got some really expensive books and I thought I got what I needed from his main
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.540]   one everybody recommended.
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:37.060]   And Robin McKenzie, he's out of New Zealand and he wrote some treat your own back stuff.
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:41.020]   And there's some other folks, but I'm just curious what you did or what you read or if
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:45.860]   you did anything or if you just kind of laid around and got better.
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:50.420]   Being six foot seven and a half inches tall, you and I kind of are in the same boat.
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.820]   Eventually you're going to tweak your back and you got to be strong.
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:54.820]   Right.
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:59.020]   I do not have any chronic pain of any kind, including back pain.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:00.760]   And so I'm very grateful for that.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:05.320]   The tweaking the back story, again, you'd probably go in a long time, but I remember
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:18.720]   distinctly when I was, I think it was 26 years old and it was the first time I hurt my back.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.880]   I was serving, I was setting up a, I can't remember what the holiday was.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.920]   It was doing breakfast omelets on the beach for all my friends.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:31.960]   I hosted this big party on the beach in Florida and I was setting up my omelet station to
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:36.080]   make omelets and I leaned down to pick up something from the ground, nothing heavy at
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.080]   all and I tweaked my back and I couldn't move.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:44.760]   And I went home and spent the next two days sitting in the recliner and it was, what was
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:50.500]   shocking about it is I've always enjoyed robust physical health, which is an enormous blessing.
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:56.280]   And when you enjoy robust physical health without fighting for it, you take it for granted.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:01.360]   And when it's taken away from you, you all of a sudden stopped taking it for granted.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:08.160]   And so that experience was what opened my eyes to the incredibly difficult experience
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.000]   that so many people have.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.140]   One other time I tweaked my back and then I, over the last couple of years, I have this
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:19.840]   occasional neck pain that happened for some reason.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.500]   And so I visit the chiropractor about once a month and as long as I do that, I don't
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:25.760]   have any trouble.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:30.920]   All of my research into back pain indicates to me that the vast majority of it is due
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.440]   to weakness in the back.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:36.960]   And so the most important thing to do is to strengthen the back and stretch it.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.000]   So stretching and strengthening the back.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.080]   I had a neighbor when I was growing up, redneck neighbor, who was injured.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:47.880]   He was a diesel mechanic and he was injured, bunch of messed up discs and whatnot.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:53.240]   They put him on total disability and he endured pain for a long time.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.400]   And then finally one day he walked out on his back porch and he said, "I'm going to
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.400]   fix this thing."
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.640]   And he reached up and he grabbed one of the rafters on his back porch and he just started
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.080]   hanging every day.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.040]   And he hung and he hung and he hung and he hung.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.280]   And he cured himself of his back pain just by hanging on his back porch every day.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:16.720]   And so as best I can understand, the majority of back pain should be treated by strengthening
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:22.160]   the back, which is probably lifting heavy weights and all of the stabilizing muscles,
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.160]   etc.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:28.840]   But strengthening the back with appropriate exercises is the key to avoiding back pain.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:35.080]   And so I've realized that you're a fool if you take your health for granted and I'm doing
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:39.560]   everything I know to do and everything I'm able to do to be one who's actively building
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.560]   stronger health.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.880]   And as Mark Ripito says, "I want to be hard to kill."
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:47.280]   So stronger people are more useful in general and harder to kill.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.960]   Love that guy.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.560]   Yeah, I forget.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.360]   Oh man, I forget the guy.
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:55.760]   See, I was writing down the names of the books because whenever I call you, I always blank
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.760]   on that.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:00.040]   But I forget I bought that guy's book too, The Hanging from the, oh, what's his name?
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.960]   John something or other, I think.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:06.840]   Anyhow, yeah, there's a guy that he's a proponent of hanging for shoulder to avoid shoulder
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:07.840]   surgery.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.600]   But I started doing that and I found it helped me back out quite a bit too.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.600]   Absolutely.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:13.760]   Yeah, you can't take it for granted, man.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.760]   You're strong until you're not.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:18.040]   And then you get laid up by part of an omelet bar.
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.040]   What do you do?
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.040]   I mean, it's really, yeah, it could take the wind out of your sail.
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.040]   Big time, big time.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:26.520]   Yeah, but I just thought I'd ask because you're a big reader.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.760]   Appreciate your time, Joshua.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760]   Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   Love the questions.
