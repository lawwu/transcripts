[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   But let's try to fit in one other quick question here before we wrap up this episode.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.920]   Comes from Vasilky.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:15.360]   He says, "Do you think a college student should abstain from social media completely?
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.040]   Many students communicate with social media.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.280]   Completely abstaining has made me feel like I'm missing out on opportunities to discuss
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280]   homework.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.240]   When I miss a class, I can ask a friend over Messenger for notes.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.840]   Even if I use only email, other people may feel discouraged to send you over email notes
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.760]   because they find Facebook or Discord more easy to scan with their phones.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.960]   I don't live near the campus, so I can't interact with other students.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.800]   What do you advise to give a student to communicate to their peers that need to abstain from social
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.760]   media but to remain in the community?"
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.200]   Well short answer, long answer, short answer, separate communication tools from social media.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.400]   What do I mean by social media here?
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.640]   I mean things where you post information to people you don't know or consume information
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.440]   posted by people you don't know.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.000]   Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Don't do that.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.920]   I mean you can, but I would say yeah, abstain from that.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.560]   I think you have other things that are more important in college.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.680]   That's a distraction.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.840]   It's not giving you any benefit.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.880]   But separate that from the fact that you use WhatsApp for your study group.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.120]   Separate communication tools from the social media.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.920]   The key thing to keep in mind is that latter context, that the tools where you post information
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.760]   to people you don't know or read information from people you don't know, that's engineered
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.760]   to be distracting.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.280]   That's what you want to stay away from.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.440]   Having a study group on WhatsApp or having a Facebook group that you're, you know, whatever
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.800]   club uses.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.800]   If you've configured Facebook like I talk about in digital minimalisms, you go straight
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.080]   to the groups and have no news feed, that's fine.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.920]   I don't care about communication tools.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.920]   But don't use social media tools that are engaged, I mean that are engineered to distract.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.920]   That's what I would recommend.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.240]   And in fact, in general, I think college students, there's so much intellectually, socially,
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.000]   just spiritually, philosophically to enjoy during that period of life that gets leeched
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.760]   away if you're looking at TikTok videos as just a default when you're bored.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.360]   I mean, it's just life is really interesting and vibrant at that point.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.240]   And if you take that out of your life as a college student, what's left is in technicolor.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.980]   It's just like a much more interesting period of time.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.720]   My long answer is be wary of the justification game you're playing.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.680]   I get this type of thing all the time, a little bait and switch.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.600]   You find this corner case of technology that there's no debate you need to use, then allow
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.320]   that to justify chaos.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.600]   I hear this from students a lot like, "Look, Cal, my math teacher post our homework on
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.240]   the internet, so I need to use the internet to download my math homework.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.560]   So that's why I'm playing Fortnite till 3 a.m."
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.840]   These are two really separate things.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.880]   And I'm seeing this in your answer here.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.400]   You're like, "Maybe a friend doesn't want to share notes with me over email, so I'm
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.680]   going to be on TikTok all day."
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   Remain specific.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.320]   And I think that's at the core of my philosophy of digital minimalism.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.540]   Figure out the life you want, what's important to you.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.920]   Figure out what technology will support that and what rules you want to use it to get the
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.080]   benefits and avoid the cost.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.900]   And outside of those decisions, be comfortable missing out on everything else.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.220]   So be specific.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.200]   Don't just use the term social media and lump the fact that you ask a question over
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.760]   WhatsApp with the fact that you're on Instagram all day.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.680]   Be specific, work backwards from values.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.880]   And yes, your main question, should you abstain from the social media that you can?
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.120]   Almost certainly the answer is probably yes.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.080]   I think for almost any college student, that is going to make their college life richer.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.860]   (upbeat music)
