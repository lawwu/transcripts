[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.320]   We recorded this episode early
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.760]   because by airtime, Pastor John,
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.000]   you'll be ministering somewhere in Hong Kong
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.160]   and you'll be there between May 20th and May 26th.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.680]   And of course, we welcome and ask for all of your prayers
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.440]   on behalf of Pastor John as he ministers in Hong Kong.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.440]   Those would be greatly appreciated.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.680]   Today's question comes from an anonymous man.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.500]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.040]   There's something I've been struggling with
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.040]   and that thing has been not feeling convicted for my sin.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.640]   I know that as a believer,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.260]   I should feel bad for indulging in sin,
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.000]   smoking pot, watching porn, lying.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.920]   Every time I do those things that I should not do,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.080]   I never feel convicted,
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.180]   nor do I feel like God is punishing me
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.400]   or is angry with me for my sin.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.160]   In fact, those things make me feel good in the moment.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.560]   I guess my main thing is that I don't know how to hate sin,
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.240]   especially when I don't feel any immediate backlash
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.360]   from God for indulging in it.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.280]   It's almost like God is giving me a free pass.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.080]   And I just am wondering why that would be.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.300]   How do I learn, Pastor John, to hate my sin?
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.940]   - First, let's be really clear
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.480]   that this man is absolutely right
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.960]   that he needs to hate sin, hate sin.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.400]   This is not optional.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.320]   It's commanded in the Bible, not suggested.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.120]   And the command is not merely to flee evil,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.440]   but to hate evil,
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.920]   just like the command is not merely to do mercy,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.840]   but to love mercy, love righteousness.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.840]   So he has his finger on the very essence of the change
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.520]   that needs to happen to every fallen, sinful human being.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.120]   Jesus put it like this
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.800]   when he was describing his own coming.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.300]   This is the judgment, this is John 3:19.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.980]   This is the judgment that light has come into the world
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.480]   and people loved darkness rather than light
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.200]   because their works were evil.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.040]   For everyone who does wicked things hates the light
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.920]   and does not come to the light
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.920]   lest his work should be exposed.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.560]   So our problem is not that we don't have light,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.920]   but that we love the darkness.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.200]   We love it.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.480]   And our friend who sent this question in
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.680]   bears witness to why we love it.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   He says, "Every time I do those things that I should not do,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.800]   "they make me feel good."
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.680]   The Bible calls this the fleeting pleasures of sin
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.920]   in Hebrews 11, 25.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.840]   Of course sin feels good.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.400]   Nobody would do it otherwise.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.520]   Nobody sins out of duty.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.420]   We do it because it feels good.
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.520]   And the reason we don't hate these behaviors
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.100]   is because we love them.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.000]   They feel good and we like to feel good.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.440]   So we like them.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.440]   We're like children who find the taste of poison sweet.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.800]   And pleasing.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.040]   And we have to be taught first
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.640]   that the bottle with the skull on it is deadly.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.640]   The big S-I-N on the bottle means it will kill you.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.640]   Don't drink that.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.280]   Avoid it.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.600]   But more deeply, we need to go deeper
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.300]   than to have a sign out front
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.000]   that keeps us from doing what we really,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.160]   really, really love to do.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.280]   We've got to go deeper.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.800]   Our tongues, the tongues of our soul,
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.720]   have to be put out of taste for the bait of the devil.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.800]   I love that quote from a Puritan.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.680]   I don't remember who said it, but they said,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.320]   "Oh God, put my tongue out of taste
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.020]   for the bait of the devil."
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.080]   It's exactly what has to happen.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.360]   We can't just constantly love evil and not do it.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.400]   We have to start hating evil.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.720]   And to do that, we need new spiritual taste buds.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.760]   We need the miracle of new birth.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.080]   So how do we get these new spiritual taste buds?
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.920]   That's his question.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.840]   And we start by realizing that we must get them.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.660]   They're not optional.
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.500]   We must.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.480]   This is not peripheral, marginal,
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.320]   icing on the cake to Christianity.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.800]   This is necessary.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.520]   We must get these new taste buds,
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.520]   and we can't get them by our willpower.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.800]   That's what we got to realize.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.360]   We must, because God commands us to,
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.360]   "Oh, you who love the Lord, hate evil," Psalm 97, 10.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.200]   Or Paul, in Romans 12, 9,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.720]   "Let love be genuine, abhor what is evil."
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.960]   It's a command.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.320]   It's not an option.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.300]   Hold fast to what is good.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.040]   So he doesn't just say, "Leave evil, reject evil."
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.180]   He says, "Abhor it."
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.360]   But you can't get hatred for evil by an act of willpower.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.200]   You know you can't.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.000]   He wouldn't even be writing in if he could,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.940]   because we are spiritually dead,
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.940]   and we need a new moral life in our taste buds,
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.840]   the taste buds of our soul
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.800]   that tell the difference between good and evil,
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   about how horrid sin tastes and how sweet holiness tastes.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.920]   So Ephesians 2, 3 sets up the awful problem.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.720]   We all once lived among the sons of disobedience,
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.540]   in the passions of our flesh,
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.780]   carrying out desires of the body and the mind.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.200]   We were by nature children of wrath,
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.300]   like the rest of mankind.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.640]   But God, being rich in mercy,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.580]   because of the great love with which he loved us,
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.700]   made us alive.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.700]   That means taste buds that abhor sin came to life.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:24.380]   Taste buds that delight in holiness came to life.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.380]   That miracle has to happen.
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.420]   We need to be given life,
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.080]   a new heart that's alive to the horror
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.180]   and the outrage of sin,
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.740]   and alive to the sweetness of holiness,
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.500]   has to come into being.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.940]   Just before Paul said in Romans 12,
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.260]   "Abhor what is evil,"
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.580]   he said, "Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.580]   "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.500]   Now that transformation is a gift of God,
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.780]   and so we must cry out for it and desperately long for it
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.780]   and not be cavalier about our deadness to it.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.340]   And the great thing is God has not left us
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.780]   without clear guidance and strong help
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.860]   as we pursue the gift and the grace of this transformation
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.620]   and this love for holiness and hatred of sin.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.380]   God hasn't walked away and left us helpless
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.060]   as if there's nothing we can do,
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.660]   and we just say, "Well, it's a miracle.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.940]   "I'll just wait till it happens."
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.820]   No.
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.420]   And the main gift that he's given us is his word,
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.260]   the Bible.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:46.260]   This is the main instrument that the Holy Spirit uses
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.960]   to give the love of holiness and the hatred of sin.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.460]   This is the work of the Spirit,
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.580]   and his instrument is the word.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.980]   You can see this, for example, in Psalm 119, 104.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.940]   It goes like this.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.940]   Through your precepts, I get understanding.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.460]   Therefore, I hate every false way.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.900]   Wow.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.260]   What a therefore.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.860]   What a therefore.
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.180]   Through your precepts, I get understanding.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.900]   Therefore, I hate every false way.
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.860]   Hatred for false ways comes through gaining understanding
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.840]   through the precepts of the word of God.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.900]   And that word functions at two levels.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.060]   And just mention these.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.940]   First, it threatens and warns us
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.140]   about the dangers of loving sin,
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.740]   and shakes us into seriousness,
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.480]   which the Holy Spirit can use to open our eyes
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.020]   to what's truly valuable.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.020]   When I read this man's words that he sent to us,
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.940]   it's as if the scriptures were specifically written
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.260]   to answer him.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.180]   It's amazing how tailor-made the scriptures are,
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.340]   because here's what he said.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.340]   He said, "Every time I do those things that I should not do,
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:21.220]   "they make me feel good in the moment.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:27.260]   "I don't feel any immediate backlash from God
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   "for indulging in it.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   "It's almost like God is giving me a free pass."
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.640]   Wow, what telling words.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.100]   In the moment, it feels good.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.880]   No immediate backlash.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.260]   Almost a free pass.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.240]   In other words, God has taught this man,
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.060]   God has taught this man that the good feeling
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.840]   that comes from sin will not last.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.340]   He's taught this man that the good feeling is in the moment.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.060]   He's taught this man that the backlash is not immediate,
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.060]   but it will come.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:14.060]   He's taught this man, almost it feels like a free pass,
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.800]   but it most certainly is not a free pass.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.060]   So he knows, he knows the truth.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.360]   The scriptures are crystal clear.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.360]   Job 20, verse five, "The exalting of the wicked is short,
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.780]   "the joy of the godless, but for a moment."
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.340]   James 5, verse five, "To the self-indulgent,
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.760]   "you have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.660]   "You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter."
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.020]   This is coming, it's coming.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:52.020]   It's not, there's no way out for the one who loves sin.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.120]   Paul mentioned sexual sins and others,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.580]   and then says, "On account of these,
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.160]   "the wrath of God is coming."
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.900]   Galatians 5, 21, "I warn you, as I warned you before,
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.180]   "those who do such things won't enter the kingdom of God."
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.320]   Matthew 5, 29, "If your eye causes you to sin,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.340]   "tear it out and throw it away,
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.860]   "it's better for you to lose one of your members
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.240]   "than that your whole body go into hell."
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.240]   So the word of God is filled with bright red flags waving,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.940]   in this man's face, in all of our faces,
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.940]   telling him and us, "Stop indulging in sin,
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.680]   "and make him serious enough that the Holy Spirit
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.060]   "might take that seriousness and drive it down deep
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.240]   "to the transformation that has to happen,"
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.800]   which leads us to the last way that the word works.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.920]   Not only does it warn us, but the main way
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.240]   that the Holy Spirit uses the word of God
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.540]   to create love for holiness and hatred for sin
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.540]   is by showing us God himself in his infinite worth
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.480]   and beauty and the sufferings of Jesus
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.840]   that he went through to purchase our holiness.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   Proverbs 8, 13, "The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil."
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:16.000]   In other words, when the word reveals
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.040]   the infinite value of God and awakens reverent
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   awe of him, the reflex is, "I hate evil
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.000]   "that is against this God."
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.380]   And Paul puts it positively like this,
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.280]   "We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:39.280]   "of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.600]   "from one degree of glory to another."
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.100]   This comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.360]   So transformation into the kind of person
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.760]   who loves holiness and hates evil
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.760]   comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit,
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.280]   but he does it as we behold the glory of the Lord.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.400]   So that's what I urge mainly.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   Every day, every day, pour over the scriptures,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.960]   looking for the beauty of Christ
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.240]   and the fearsomeness of God,
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.360]   and crying out for a heart that loves holiness
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.340]   and hates sin.
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.320]   Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.640]   It's questions like this one,
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.000]   even anonymous questions like this one,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.920]   that are incredibly valuable to us
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.440]   in directing this podcast and where we go in the future.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.760]   So thank you for the many questions
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.240]   that you have sent in to us over the years.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.840]   Please keep them coming.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.160]   And this is my chance to let you know

[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.120]   He will be there between May 20th and May 26th.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.000]   So thank you for your prayers.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.360]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
