[00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:09.760]   yesterday we didn't sprint but we did a lot of skipping let's talk about skipping and yes i'm
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.000]   talking about skip skip skip this okay this thing i'm not gonna sing the rest of that
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.120]   skipping is such a natural movement for people most people and it feels so damn good
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.360]   and it's actually a bit more taxing than people believe and i came out of that workout skipping
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.760]   yesterday from skipping yesterday feeling like my hips were nice and open tons of extension my
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.920]   posture is up i feel like i grew an inch i i was strong in the gym this morning i just feel incredible
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.960]   what is it about skipping and why do you have sprinters skip so much we skipped a lot because
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.160]   the reality is you could not sprint and that is the reality for almost everybody because we stopped
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.720]   sprinting when we're whatever age some people stop sprinting at 15 sometimes some people it's 20.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.840]   but very few people are actually sprinting through their 20s and next to nobody is sprinting through
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.520]   their 30s so we know that the movement of sprinting or running fast and we kind of know what what this
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.240]   does and why this is good for you right we know that yeah moving our body intensively with intensity
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.040]   is probably something we should be able to do for as long as we possibly can but we can't because
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.440]   typically we've still got pretty good engines into our 30s and 40s and 50s but we don't have the bodies
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.720]   to be able to handle the stresses and the forces that this engine could put into the body so our tissue
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.920]   and our joints just is not able to handle all of these forces if you were to go out and sprint
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.640]   yesterday even if we did you know we ended up warming up for how long an hour and a half warm-up
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.760]   if we did a let's say a real proper warm-up we warmed up for 30 minutes and then i just said
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.040]   andrew i want you to sprint as fast as you possibly can for 50 meters that's not going to end well for
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.200]   most people maybe you could get through it yesterday but for most people that wouldn't end well you end up
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.920]   with a pull or a extra strain or a couple days of just feeling not well because we just don't do that
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.000]   and we don't have the tissue capacity to be able to handle that anymore or the joint capacity
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.120]   you know there's so many people assuming they they have to run really quickly somewhere and they just
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.680]   didn't know that they had to do it or they're playing backyard basketball or football and they tweak
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.360]   a hamstring or tweak a calf or something even worse right it happens all the time we just do not have the tissue
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.960]   capacity anymore to handle those forces so what do we do instead and i i typically recommend two
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.200]   activities one is running up hills there's a lot less stress on the tissue and the joint system
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.800]   by sprinting up a hill than there is on sprinting on a straightaway but second i think more important is
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.280]   actually skipping and i and i'm with you i don't know why we stop skipping i think it's associated with
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.720]   uh only childlike behavior but that's like saying jump rope is only associated with childlike behavior
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   and i'm a big believer in skipping rope we'll talk about skipping rope but i think that's it um yeah
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.840]   i mean maybe this conversation or this portion of the conversation could be titled you know um let's
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.040]   normalize skipping yeah for adults absolutely it felt awesome yeah you can cover a lot of ground quickly
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.680]   heart rate gets up but not to an outrageous degree you're not sucking for air but it does feel a
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.600]   little silly if you're not on a track but you've mentioned uh you've what's the longest distance
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.440]   you've ever skipped 10 miles did you get some funny looks i got a few nice and you're a real tall guy
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.600]   you're 6'3 so you can't really uh hide no uh very easily that was in the park so there wasn't a lot of
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.800]   people okay but i skipped for uh 20 minutes every morning on the roads i get a few honks
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.240]   that's okay i mean they could be honks of approval could well be yeah or something else but you think
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.080]   about it like it's you you're actually taxing the coordination patterns and the tissue and the joints
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.280]   in pretty similar ways as if we were going to sprint we're working on pushing the knee behind the hip
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.880]   getting into this knee behind butt pattern this hip extension pattern which is so important and
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.560]   i know this is a a topic of conversation that you had with kelly when kelly was on here the importance
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.240]   of getting your knee behind your butt and finding and searching for opportunities to do that more often
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.280]   because we lose that so easily so skipping allows us to do that secondary to that is the coordination
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.440]   aspect between how we coordinate the flexion extension at the ankle the flexion extension
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.200]   at the knee and the flexion extension at the hip and we do that in a very similar way as sprinting
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.600]   where each of them stiffen at this at this time that is um uh considered throughout the entirety of the
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.200]   system where it's just like the spring the leg acts as a spring where if you think about when we jog
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.680]   when we run we're kind of running on our ankles and knees a little bit we don't feel like we're really
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.360]   using our hips when you're running a 10 minute mile it's all it's a lot of stress through the foot
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.160]   it's a lot of stress through the calves and by the way i'm not anti-running or anti-jogging i jog
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.200]   and i run and i still do all that stuff i'm not saying now stop doing all that and just go and skip
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.800]   i'm just saying find some opportunities to also skip because skipping where ashley can tax the system
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.560]   in very similar ways as pretty high intensity sprinting i want to hover a little bit on knee
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:42.000]   behind butt so knee behind kelly starrett shout out kelly starrett i mean if you think about this
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.040]   folks like knee behind butt means into extension so the hips are opening so to speak i know in yoga they
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.200]   say hip opening means a different thing but hip extension generally means posture is more elevated
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.680]   chin away from chest generally i mean you could get knee behind butt with your chin down but it's
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:07.680]   tougher just the sternum comes up kind of naturally puts us into external rotation so think thumbs out
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.880]   to the side like the fawns as opposed to inward and then you think about the the typical sitting standing
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:23.360]   walking jogging pattern of everybody yeah especially if you're a commuter um doesn't matter if you're on a
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:32.240]   subway bus um car or otherwise or plane you're you're folded in and so what i'm starting to realize is that
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   knee uh knee behind butt ankle elevated sternum up i mean these are the hallmarks of locomotion yeah and so
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   it's interesting that walking well jogging in particular seems to follow this kind of like
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.760]   forward folded kind of like almost like falling forward kind of thing i'm not trying to beat up on
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.280]   jogging because i also like to jog but i wonder if minute for minute
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:08.240]   skipping would be a much better activity than jogging for people who want to elevate their heart rate you know
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.880]   all the standard general adaptations that occur with exercise improved insulin regulation etc etc
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.360]   um do you think for the person who has not skipped in a while to go out and
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.640]   skip for a couple minutes is the way to do it or should they skip for a lap and then walk a
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.280]   lap what would be the way to break into this yeah i think i think probably the the worst thing to do is
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:34.720]   go out for a 10 mile skip don't do that i think we start off with like a 30 second skip 30 second jog 30
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.640]   second skip 30 second jog or 30 second skip followed by a 30 second walk and the difference is you'll
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.600]   feel this right if you think about when you skip and we talked about this a lot yesterday i was asking
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.400]   you to be expressive express yourself think about what your posture is and how you're holding yourself
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.200]   you don't really feel you don't seem to think about those things when you jog you just jog and
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.040]   as you said you're kind of closed and small and short and you're just trying to get through it
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.240]   right the heart rate gets up to whatever it is and yeah you get some good exercise but skipping here's
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.400]   your opportunity to truly express yourself be big and free and open and bouncy and rhythmical all of
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.720]   these things that were at one point in our lives pretty important to us and we lose and that's what's
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.000]   that's is what we get from sprinting right the best sprinters are the ones who can express themselves
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.480]   truly maximally like totally let go and it doesn't have to be like massively powerful like the skips
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.320]   that we were doing yesterday were what we call low amplitude skips where we're just sort of skipping
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.600]   back and forth but you're still asking you to be tall and expressive and swing and be stiff on the
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.840]   ground and i feel like like there's as i said there's so many different benefits to this whether
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.480]   it's just been the plyometric benefit whether it's the fascial benefit whether it because this is such a
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:02.320]   a cross-body coordinative aspect there's all sorts of brain benefits to that as you know it's uh i mean
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.800]   it's just it's just there's so much more benefits to skipping than there is to just jogging so the on-ramp
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.080]   for me when i talk to people about the benefits of skipping is just to put it in their jogs so i was
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:20.160]   talking to one of your photographers yesterday and said how do i do this i usually jog and i i'm going
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.600]   like 10 minute mile pace i said well next time you jog just in you know go for your jogs you know go for
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.320]   about a mile or so when you're doing a typical jog and then just go back and forth between skipping
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:37.040]   and jogging every 30 seconds or so and i guarantee you that you will feel better with every skip that you
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.280]   do every single one because there's this again the self-organizing coordinative aspect to it where you
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.160]   start feeling a little bit more bouncy a little lighter a little bit more coordinated a little bit
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:54.240]   more rhythmic which feeds your jogging so for me that's probably the best on-ramp is just to work it
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.600]   into your current jogs and then from there start getting a little bit more powerful with it a little
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.640]   bit more expressive with it now we start driving the thigh up and back and get again a little a little bit
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.240]   more hip extension start being you know now we can start talking about skips for distance
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.320]   where you're trying to say okay from here that tree that's 50 meters away how many steps do i need to
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:23.200]   take to get to that 50 meter away tree so doing things like that yeah i'm fascinated by activities both
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:30.240]   physical and mental that facilitate the transition into a more difficult activity physical or mental
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:39.600]   i started to think about this when i started working on my book in earnest it's very hard to
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:46.240]   just jump into writing but i noticed that if i did some drawing listen to a lecture while i was
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:53.200]   drawing and i do anatomical drawings very easy to transition into writing i enjoy drawing i'm not
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.720]   trying to accomplish much with it but it's a very natural activity for me and just very easy to drop into a
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   deep groove for writing for hours really and then i started talking to a musician friend of mine who
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.400]   he's a songwriter very accomplished songwriter and he does the same and then i saw a post from joanie
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.200]   mitchell that she would paint before she would sing and i think these transition activities that are
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:21.360]   natural for us that don't feel as constricted by distance over time or you know sometimes i put my
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.480]   drawings on social media but they're really for me their way of kind of thinking about the biology from a
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.120]   circuit standpoint it is very personal and kind of abstract um as you talk about skipping it seems a
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.640]   little bit the same where you know skipping we're not necessarily trying to become the fastest skipper
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:45.280]   in the world or beat our yesterday's skipping time we're just trying to skip with more as you said more
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:52.240]   expression more enjoyment but perhaps it sounds like indeed it can help transition into a faster gate
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:59.120]   with what we're doing for jogging or for running or transition us right into into sprinting and i think
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:05.520]   that these um transition points for physical and mental activities are very important because these days
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.240]   there's so many tools and protocols you know dare i say and people start to feel like oh i have to do all of
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.480]   these things how would i do this right how am i supposed to meditate and get sunlight and do you
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.720]   know i already exercising a ton now i mean now you want me to skip the way you describe it is completely
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.200]   different it's saying no you're still doing your cardio quote unquote but maybe you do your zone two
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:33.120]   cardio and you incorporate some skipping which will make your zone two faster for you yeah or your your
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.920]   your high intensity interval training more um you'll feel more pliable yeah more explosive
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.600]   mike that yeah i think that's that's part of it i think step one is incorporating in so you can
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.880]   actually be comfortable skipping and step two is now can we add a little bit more speed force
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.480]   velocity to that skip where it becomes in and of itself a workout where you're skipping as hard
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.280]   as you can for 50 meters and walking back and doing that 10 to 15 times is that would you consider
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.240]   that a solid workout for skipping that would be a great skipping workout skipping 50 meters walking
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:11.760]   back yeah doing that 10 to 15 times yeah because that's that is safe if you warm up i'm not saying
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.280]   go out and do a maximal effort skip for 50 meters without doing a warm-up do a good warm-up first that
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.720]   includes some low amplitude skips and maybe some jogs and some stretches do that for 10 or 15 minutes
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:28.880]   and then do some maximal amplitude skips or over 50 meters that's a great workout in and of itself like
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:41.600]   a lot a lot of really beneficial plyometric work being done there
