[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   Sean from Seattle writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, over the past year, my brother fought
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.380]   a cancerous tumor in his optic nerve.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.400]   He is only 20 years old.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.080]   By the grace of God, the cancer is gone now, but he is blind.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.560]   When I talk to him, he tells me that he knows that he doesn't get to have a life anymore.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.280]   What words of encouragement might you have for my dear brother or for any young man or
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.800]   woman who feels like a physical disability has taken their life away?"
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:44.880]   I have sometimes stood in the shower after running a few miles and experienced a strange
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:54.320]   bright yellow donut in my vision that sometimes seems like it's going to completely take over
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.960]   my sight and blot out everything else.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.240]   It's been very scary at times, and I asked the doctor about it at one time, and he said,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.460]   "Well, it's in your brain, not in your eyes."
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.840]   And I wasn't sure whether to be encouraged by that or not.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.240]   At any rate, my point is this.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:26.480]   In those times, I have had a very vivid thought about going blind, and I have wondered what
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.640]   life would be like and whether I would sink into a depression that I wouldn't be able
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.200]   to get out of.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.200]   I don't have any romantic notions that it would be easy or that I would have a heroic
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.920]   attitude of making the best of it.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.800]   My guess is, given the way I'm wired, it would be a long, hard struggle, first just to learn
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:01.360]   how to survive and to want to survive, and then even harder to feel like life is worth
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.000]   living and that my life might be useful again.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.740]   So I don't want Sean or his brother to feel like my response is presumptuous, as if blindness
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.520]   would not be a great spiritual struggle for me.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.220]   I feel the same way about the prospect of blindness, the way I feel about suffering
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.240]   at the end of my life or being persecuted or tortured.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.920]   I sometimes wonder if today's grace will be there for that trial, and I know that's
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.840]   not the way it works, that if I'm going to be able to meet the trial of going blind or
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.680]   suffering or being tortured at the end of life, I'm going to need a special grace,
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:58.120]   a specific grace in the moment for that very specific trial that I face.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.920]   And that's what I pray for Sean and his brother, that God would give a special grace,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.120]   a specific, precise, tailor-made grace for this particular burden of blindness.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.960]   I think when Jesus said, "Tomorrow will be anxious for itself, sufficient for the
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:27.040]   day is its own trouble," in Matthew 6, and then Jeremiah said in Lamentations 3, "God's
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.520]   mercies are new every morning," I think they meant that there is a new, special mercy
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.760]   from God for every new, special trouble that each day brings.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.040]   Sean's brother's first 20 years was full of grace.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   It was.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.320]   I don't even have to know him to know that.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.320]   But now this is a new sorrow, a new trouble, a new affliction, and God's promises are
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:06.720]   that there will be new mercies, special mercies, specific, tailor-made mercies that were never
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.440]   there before that are perfectly suited for the burden of blindness.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.680]   And I know that the temptation will be for Sean's brother to hear me or anybody else
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.960]   try to encourage him by saying, "Well, easy for you to say, you're not blind."
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.640]   I get that, and I would probably feel the same way.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.640]   So I encourage him to read, perhaps, Johnny Erickson Tada.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.920]   Her challenge was not blindness.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.640]   She broke her back when she was 17, and she's been paralyzed with very little feeling from
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:51.680]   her shoulders down in a wheelchair for 40 years.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.400]   And the life that God has given her in her weakness, turning it into Christ-exalting
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.560]   hope for others, has simply been breathtaking.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.200]   Here's what she said, "I hope I can take my wheelchair to heaven with me."
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.360]   I know that's not biblically correct, but if it were, I would have my wheelchair up
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.480]   there in heaven right next to me when God gives me my brand-new glorified body, and
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.840]   I would then turn to Jesus and say, "Lord, do you see this wheelchair right here?"
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.520]   Well, you were right when you said that in the world we would have trouble, because that
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.640]   wheelchair has been a lot of trouble.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:36.560]   But Jesus, the weaker I was in that thing, the harder I leaned on you, and the harder
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.280]   I leaned on you, the stronger I discovered you to be.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.240]   So thank you for what you did in my life through that wheelchair.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.520]   And now, I always say jokingly, you can send that wheelchair to hell if you want.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   Wow.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.520]   That's Johnny.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.560]   That's Johnny 40 years on after where Sean's brother is probably right now.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.680]   Paraplegia, blindness, every pain, every disability, every tear will be wiped away from God's children,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.280]   every disease and disability will be cast into hell, along with all who have turned
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.840]   away from his mercies.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.960]   One of the keys to finding strength to live with disability here, even the extraordinary
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:34.760]   disability of blindness, is to experience the grace of God in the unshakable confidence
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:43.840]   that this life, as precious as it is, is only prelude to the life which is life indeed.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:51.760]   This life, in fact, in reality, not pretending, not romanticizing, not dreaming, but being
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:59.520]   utterly realistic, this life is very, very short.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:06.280]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4, "These afflictions are light and momentary."
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.040]   And by momentary, he meant a lifetime.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.160]   Peter says, "We may suffer various trials for a little while."
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.320]   And by a little while, he meant a lifetime.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.480]   James says, "This life is like a vapor's breath on a winter's morning."
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.840]   Two seconds max, and that vapor's breath is a lifetime.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:37.080]   And of course, it's a miracle, a wonderful God-given miracle to believe that and to live
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.440]   in the joyful confidence that in a vapor's breath, I will see again.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.960]   In a vapor's breath, I will walk again.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.520]   And I pray for that miracle for Sean's brother.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.280]   It is a precious thing, I know.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:01.880]   It is a precious thing to be able to see the beauties of the world and the people of this
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.920]   world with the eyes that are in our head.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:13.800]   But it is, and I pray that there will be grace for Sean's brother to believe this, it is
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   an infinitely more precious thing to see with the eyes of the heart, as Paul calls them
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.320]   in Ephesians 1.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:31.720]   The greatest tragedy in the world is that people with good eyes cannot see.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.680]   I would encourage Sean's brother to think about this.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.400]   Millions of people use their good eyes and look at the natural world and do not see the
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.720]   glory of God.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.560]   Thousands of people use their good eyes and looked at the very Son of God in the flesh
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:53.000]   and did not see the glory of the only begotten from the Father.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.240]   Millions of people hear the gospel with their good ears and read the precious pages of the
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:05.120]   Bible with their good eyes and do not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.680]   This is the greatest tragedy in the world.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:16.320]   But Sean's brother has the opportunity now to see and to see and to see, to see the glory
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.240]   of God in everything he touches and tastes and smells and hears, to see the glory of
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:32.480]   Christ in every story from the Bible and every promise of grace, and to see the utter folly
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:39.360]   of the world in using their good eyes to commit idolatry instead of loving the unseen God
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.880]   supremely.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.720]   Jesus lamented the blindness in Jerusalem.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.880]   He said, "Seeing they do not see."
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:10:01.360]   And I pray that Jesus would say just the opposite over Sean's brother.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.120]   Blessed are your eyes, because not seeing you see.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   Amen.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.920]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that incredible word.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.760]   We have a related question to suffering and God's sovereignty on the docket tomorrow,
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.320]   namely, "Will God hurt me physically and then call it good?"
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.400]   These are the kinds of tricky, real-life pastoral questions that we've been tackling on the
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.680]   podcast for over 830 episodes now.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.860]   And all of those episodes are available online.
