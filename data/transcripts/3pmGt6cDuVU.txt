[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   I think a lot of people think, "Well, I've got my American Airlines miles, so obviously
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.600]   the way to search for awards is to just get on aa.com and type in where I want to go and
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.800]   see what comes up."
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.220]   There's a couple of problems with that.
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.440]   One is that you might miss some great opportunities to use your American Airlines miles because
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.400]   you didn't look at other dates or you didn't look at other cities.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.080]   So for example, you might be wanting to fly somewhere far away to South Africa, let's
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.080]   say.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.360]   Maybe you started your search in San Francisco, but the best flight awards might be available
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.920]   from L.A., and so you might be able to book that first leg separately to get to L.A. and
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.560]   then get that great award flight.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.240]   You wouldn't have seen that if you just get on aa.com and do that simple search.
