[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   >> When we go to the dojos there,
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.000]   we all get thrown by people that never come out to be world champions.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   They're just in the mix or they're going through three years of university,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.720]   and then they go, we had a guy that came in.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.440]   He was business guy, he came in with his suitcase and his tie up like that,
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.480]   and he's in his lunch hour.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.840]   He's in his lunch hour, so we've got to be quick.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.120]   >> So he comes in and he goes through,
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.000]   he's working his way through the whole of the British team.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.680]   We're all lined up, right?
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.760]   Ten minutes later, he's just tying his tie up like that,
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.000]   and back to work like that.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.660]   Imagine him sitting behind his desk in his computer.
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.200]   >> I'm glad he didn't get out.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.120]   >> Who do you think wins, Yamashita?
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.920]   >> I think Yamashita, but-
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.200]   >> Wait. Do you think Yamashita will be steady in there?
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.400]   >> I think so.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:01.400]   >> Strong words. The following is a conversation with Neil Adams,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.860]   a legend in the sport of Judo.
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.800]   He is a world champion,
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.720]   two-time Olympic silver medalist,
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   five-time European champion,
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.320]   and often referred to as the voice of Judo.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.720]   Commentating all the major events,
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.960]   world championships, and Olympic games.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.220]   Highlighting the drama, the triumph,
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.560]   the artistry of the sport of Judo.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.800]   Making fans like me feel the biggest wins,
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.080]   the biggest losses, the surprise turns of fortune,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.360]   the dominance of champions coming to an end,
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.600]   and new champions made.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.720]   Always speaking from the heart.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.200]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.480]   Now, dear friends, here's Neil Adams.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.460]   You are a five-time European champion, world champion,
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.900]   two-time Olympic silver medalist.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.300]   Let's first go to the 1980 Olympics.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.920]   Where was your mind?
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.060]   What was your preparation like?
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.740]   What was your strategy leading into that Olympics?
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.620]   >> That was my first Olympic games.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.340]   My preparation was a little bit different to how it
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.620]   was the '84 and the '88 Olympic games.
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.460]   I'd done part of the preparation as well for '76 Olympic games.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.440]   I wasn't quite old enough for those,
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.100]   but I was first reserve.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.220]   In 1980, I'd had four years build up,
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.700]   and I was hungry,
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.860]   and I was one of these young athletes,
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.940]   and I see them so often now that was developing and full of,
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.480]   I won't say I was full of myself,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.380]   but I was certainly confident of my ability,
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.420]   and I wanted to conquer the world.
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.300]   I'd had a couple of really tight matches
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.580]   with the current Olympic world champion.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.040]   I knew that there was possibility that I could get there for the '80 Olympics.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.840]   Building up to the '80 Olympics was quite
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.340]   interesting because I was coming through the weights,
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.420]   and I was halfway in between the 71 kilos weight category,
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.260]   and the higher weight category of 78 kilograms.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.580]   I'd got third place at the '79 World Championships,
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.260]   the weight below.
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.500]   For the whole year at the higher weight category,
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.100]   didn't want to lose a contest,
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.540]   so I'd beaten everybody in the world.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.600]   Then I had to make decision as to whether to
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.860]   drop to the weight below because I was seeded in the weight below.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.320]   It was a different seeding then.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.220]   So I decided to drop into the weight below because I was seeded in the top four,
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.520]   and as it happens,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.140]   I think it was probably the worst decision I made.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.660]   Well, simply because it was
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.860]   the only contest that I lost was the final of the Olympic Games in that year.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.780]   >> So you're a young kid,
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.140]   what, 1920 at that time,
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.340]   full of confidence, vigor.
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.100]   The decision to cut weight,
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.140]   how hard was it for you to cut weight to the 71 kg division?
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.580]   >> I've got to say that it was the hardest because as I was going up,
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.780]   I was, it was 73,
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.600]   then it was 74 kilos,
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.540]   75, so I was moving through the weight category.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.340]   It wasn't like I was stuck in the middle and then I dropped the old time to compete.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.300]   It was literally going up in weight by a kilo every month.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.560]   Then by the time I came to a month or two before the Olympics,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.460]   it was really hard.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.620]   Fought the European Championships at the higher weight category and won that.
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.860]   So everybody that was on the Olympic rostrum at
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.220]   the Olympic Games was on my rostrum at the European Championships.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.900]   So was it a mistake?
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.380]   Yeah, because I didn't have my diet sorted out,
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.540]   my nutrition was appalling.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.980]   It wasn't as readily available as it is now for the nutrition.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.580]   I would say that if anything lost me that final,
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.820]   other than the fact that I was fighting somebody who was terrific.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.860]   He was an excellent, brilliant athlete.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.700]   But it definitely didn't help that my nutrition was not very good.
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.140]   >> So you lost to Ezio Gama.
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.820]   There's probably a lot that we could say about that particular match.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.980]   Maybe let's zoom in. What were your strengths and
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.180]   weaknesses judo-wise in that Olympics?
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.820]   You said you haven't really lost a match,
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.060]   you won the European Championship leading into it.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.400]   But if you had weak spots,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.880]   okay, you already said diet,
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.700]   but specifically on the mat in terms of judo.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.380]   >> I think that none of the fights lasted time going into the final.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.020]   So I won fairly quickly and every match by Ippon way before time.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.180]   >> Do you remember how you won the match?
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.300]   >> I won them by throw,
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.900]   a couple of throws for Ippon and then arm lock for Ippon.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.820]   Semi-final was an arm lock against the East German Kruger.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.460]   I was flying through.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.460]   >> What were the throws? Do you remember?
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.380]   >> Tai otoshi, uchimata,
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.660]   my favorite Toku was my favorite throws.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.700]   Then jujikotami as well,
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.060]   which was a jujikotami roll against an East German who I'd beaten before,
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.980]   but always had a really tough match,
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.620]   but I managed to beat him well.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.580]   >> So you had a beautiful exhibition of
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.380]   Japanese type judo in the first two matches.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.940]   >> You threw people and then you also did the nawaza,
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.780]   you on-barred a person.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.060]   Great. So you're going into the final.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.220]   What are the weaknesses going into the final against the Italian?
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.780]   >> Like I say, taking nothing away from him as a great athlete and
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.620]   a brilliant judo man and left,
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.820]   which wasn't good for me.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.620]   That was definite no,
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.460]   because I hated fighting lefties, still do.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.780]   But I'll tell you why in a minute.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.780]   >> Great.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.540]   >> It's one of those. But I think as I went through the contest,
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.660]   we had an eight-hour break from the semi-final to the final.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.660]   They took us back to the Olympic Village.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.620]   Then we had to come back in and then we had to start a warm-up again.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.260]   I lost my momentum.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.780]   I had to start again. I didn't.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.980]   I just didn't. I had a job to get going.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.180]   I got halfway through,
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.700]   started to rescue a dying match and I was one step,
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.620]   half a step behind all the way through.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.860]   So never really got into it.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.580]   >> So why do you hate fighting lefties?
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.340]   Lefties are, we should say,
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.660]   over-represented in terms of the higher ranks of judo.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.340]   I don't know why that is.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.740]   >> Well, the thing is about a lefty is a lefty will
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.260]   have more opportunity to fight right-handers.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.700]   Because 70 percent of the population are right-handers,
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:08.140]   30 percent left, so they get to fight more right-handers.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.380]   It's just a fact that happens.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.780]   So the thing that they hate is fighting left against left.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.260]   They don't like it left against left.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.500]   Whereas a right-hander will go right against right.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.780]   But the opposite is awkward for me
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.980]   because just simply I like to go onto
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.260]   the sleeve and then I like to dominate the grips.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:38.420]   But the actual angle of the opponent wasn't what I wanted.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.020]   So I had to work hard, really hard against it.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.140]   >> What happened in that match?
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.300]   >> It was a split decision in the end.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.340]   So to lose an Olympic final on a split decision is pretty,
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.860]   it's something that's still on my mind.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.260]   I think that it's a strange one because I can still wake
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.820]   up that one and four years later at the Olympics because I was
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.140]   silver medalist at the Olympics four years later as well.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.140]   Yeah, it still haunts me.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.040]   >> Do you sometimes wake up and think like,
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.740]   "Man, I should have eaten better."
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.380]   >> Or maybe like a specific grip,
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.500]   that you're like, "I shouldn't have taken that grip."
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.820]   >> I do. I mean,
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.380]   the diet side of it,
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.740]   it's difficult to really admit that, isn't it?
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.860]   That you went to an Olympic games and
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.500]   the one thing that you really sucked at,
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:38.300]   was one of the most important things now at world level sport,
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.140]   where you've got the nutrition, we've got it.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.500]   You would think that most people have got it sorted,
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.140]   but there's still people making mistakes.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.020]   There's still people that haven't got it totally sorted.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.480]   >> Then there's people like Travis Stevens,
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.460]   who I think doesn't care.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.500]   He'll just have atrocious nutrition and he just makes it work.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.020]   I think the way he spoke about it is,
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.580]   you can't always control nutrition,
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.940]   so it's best to get good at having crappy nutrition.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.340]   >> It's a good way of looking at it. Maybe that's what I did.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.300]   >> Exactly. Do you remember what you were eating?
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.580]   We're talking about like candy or?
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.300]   >> Yeah. Well, I got a sweet tooth,
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.300]   but it wasn't really.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.900]   I mean, I didn't have a lot of money at that particular time either.
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:30.380]   The diet wasn't steak and good nutritional salads and things like that.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.620]   I did what I thought was best without proper advice.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.380]   The crazy thing is that I had such good advice as well.
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.580]   When it came to fitness training and things like that,
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.220]   we're quite ahead of our time and we really had
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.900]   it nailed as far as the conditioning was concerned.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.900]   The Judo training as well was
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.540]   a way in advance because I was a good trainer and I trained more than most.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.820]   I can honestly say that.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.260]   It probably got me away with a lot.
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.300]   >> Where was your mind for mental preparation?
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.020]   Going into that Olympics,
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.460]   you said you were confident,
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.060]   but is there some preparation aspect behind that confidence?
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.820]   >> I think in the early days,
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.580]   I didn't think I was going to lose.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.300]   I never thought it was possible to lose.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.660]   I think that I went into every contest expecting to win.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.100]   When it didn't quite go my way,
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.620]   I didn't lose that many contests.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.540]   The only ones I lost were in
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.820]   the final of the World Championships or in the final of the Olympic Games.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.060]   I didn't lose that many.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.780]   I never lost a European title.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.900]   I had seven golds at the European Championships,
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.540]   five seniors, two juniors, and 20s.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.140]   I never lost the final.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.340]   Then I only lost two on a split decision.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.780]   I didn't lose that many.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.260]   My attitude was that I wasn't going to lose and I couldn't lose.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:12:00.820]   I was always surprised when something happened.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.100]   >> In Neil Adams, A Life in Judo,
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.060]   written in 1986, you wrote,
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.780]   "Ever since I can remember,
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.500]   I have wanted to win.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.940]   It wasn't the ordinary feeling that children have when they take part in
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.860]   their first primary school sack race on a grass track or
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.500]   even the keen determination of a young swimmer prepared to train early in
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.260]   the cold winter mornings in order to make it into the countryside.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.060]   With me, the desire to win was and still is
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.260]   as much a part of me as my arms and legs.
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.500]   In other words, it wasn't something I learned as I grew older,
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.220]   but rather it was deeply rooted in me.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.740]   Perhaps this competitive instinct is the greatest difference between
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.620]   my public image and the view from the inside."
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.060]   So people see the kindness,
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.660]   the warmth you have,
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.860]   the charisma, the excitement,
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.340]   but there's this big drive to win inside you.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.340]   So what's behind that?
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:05.620]   Can you just speak to that drive to win and how that contributed to your-
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.020]   >> When I look back now-
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.860]   >> That's a lot of years ago, we should say.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.100]   >> It is a lot of years ago.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.180]   >> Is that true or were you just being poetic?
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.460]   >> It's not far off.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:13.980]   >> Okay.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.620]   >> When I think about it now,
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.260]   because I'd like to think that I'm a different person now,
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.980]   and since I've calmed down,
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.940]   I see athletes now and I see them,
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:33.140]   they're arrogance, they're walking, it's a strut.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.140]   It's a confidence, isn't it?
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.460]   As we're older and as I've become older,
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.660]   I've calmed down.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.620]   But it doesn't matter what I'm doing,
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.260]   it's still that will to win.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.100]   I'm much better at masking it now if I don't,
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.820]   but it still bothers me as much.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.540]   >> You're talking about, I don't know,
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.180]   even just stupid silly things like a game of pool,
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.820]   or something like this, or just anything.
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.980]   >> Yeah, I'm still trying to win.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:09.380]   My son, he loves to play me at bowls because I'm useless,
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.260]   and I just can't throw a straight ball.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.020]   He loves playing me at that,
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.100]   but it bugs me that I'm not better.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.620]   There are certain things that I do,
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.740]   it really bugs me when I'm not good at it.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.900]   I guess it's one of the reasons that,
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.820]   long after I'd finished competition, Judo,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.380]   people still want to train with you.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.020]   Even at an older age,
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:42.700]   even now, if I do a seminar or do you want to still go?
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.860]   Can I feel it? One of the things that's in me
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.540]   is that all the way up to 40 years of age.
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.060]   From 30 when I finished competition up to 40,
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.940]   I could still train with the best,
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.260]   and I could still go with anybody.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.060]   Then when 40 hit,
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.660]   things started to fall off a little bit.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.060]   I used to get either my hips or my legs and my knees.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.820]   I realized that I had to pick my practices,
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.620]   and that rankled as well,
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.180]   and I had to then just calm it down a little bit.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.380]   Otherwise, I was going to be injured,
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.620]   and it's not a good thing when you get an older
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.220]   and you've still got the same competitive mind.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.620]   But things change.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.380]   >> So still there, you get on the mat,
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.860]   probably even now, you get on the mat with the world champion,
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.020]   you're still the current world champion.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.300]   There's still a little part of you,
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.340]   could I still toss this guy?
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.340]   Kids these days are soft.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.380]   >> I did. Well, some of these athletes,
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:48.180]   I give you a prime example, is Ilias Iliadis.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.140]   He is a monster.
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.580]   You just, of course,
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:58.700]   you couldn't, because just at 60 something, you couldn't.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.780]   But you like to think that you could.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.180]   >> You could, you never know, you got to find out.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.780]   >> You know what you would do?
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.260]   What you can do is you can cause them problems,
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.980]   and they feel it immediately,
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.500]   but you'd last a minute.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.180]   >> So you've trained with Ilias Iliadis.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.940]   >> I've gotten a chance to train with him as well.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.020]   He's a really nice guy, really great guy.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.740]   >> He trained with me. We were training together.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.700]   Every hotel that we used to go into,
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.340]   we'd end up in the gym together and we'd train.
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.700]   This one time he was in there and he just wanted
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.900]   somebody to grab and grip hold of him.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.980]   So we ended up doing this grappling in the middle.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.380]   The people doing weight training and the different things,
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.620]   watching these two madmen doing,
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.140]   I'm glad we weren't on a mat at that particular time.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.820]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.620]   >> But good fun.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.740]   >> What do you think about that guy?
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.060]   He, like you, achieved a lot of success when he was young.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.500]   >> 17. You imagine that?
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.380]   17, 18 years of age,
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.220]   and he's able to compete with the men.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.820]   There's not many men can do that,
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.060]   and it doesn't happen very often.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.980]   It happens later with the men.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.940]   Often, they're not physically as developed as they.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.060]   So for me, for example,
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.420]   I fought Nev Zorov, who was World and Olympic champion.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.500]   He was the current World and Olympic champion.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:18.620]   They sent me to the European Championships senior at 17.
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.180]   That doesn't happen very often,
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.060]   and I pulled Nev Zorov.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:27.540]   So I fought Nev Zorov and I had him really worried,
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.660]   because he expected without a doubt to come out,
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.660]   throw this kid and junior.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.140]   >> He was thick and shredded like he's a man.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.420]   >> He was shredded.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.100]   There's a picture of him in his judogi,
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.660]   and his judogi is just cut,
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.660]   and he looks the business.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.460]   There's me in this baggy.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.980]   Skinny kid inside this baggy thing.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.180]   The thing was, is that the more he tried,
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.380]   and the harder he tried,
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.980]   and the more he panicked,
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.940]   the further it went away from him.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:05.060]   Of course, he got the decision at the end,
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.860]   and deservedly, but I worried him.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.860]   For me, that was a massive step forward,
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.420]   because a year later,
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.620]   I was starting to fill out,
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.740]   and two years later,
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.580]   I was competing for the Olympic title.
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.100]   >> I don't know if I remember,
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.700]   but Elias Eliadis is interesting,
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.620]   because even at 17,
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.460]   I feel like he was doing big throws,
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.180]   like literally lifting them with his hands.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.740]   >> Just rips them out of the ground.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.500]   I was saying to Nikki, my wife,
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.820]   and she said, "What would you do now,
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.940]   that was different than the way you did then?"
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.500]   I never had any pickups.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.540]   That's not what we did.
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.260]   But you have a look at the young Ukraines,
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.980]   or the young Russians,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.020]   or the young Eastern Bloc Mongolians,
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.940]   and they're ripping people out the ground.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.740]   It's just different style of judo,
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.340]   and it just looks different.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.980]   But now they're starting to do
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.900]   traditional style judo as well.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.740]   >> So can you speak to that,
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.540]   what are the different styles of judo?
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.380]   So for you, you mentioned Uchimaru, Taira Toshi,
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.580]   these, how would you describe them?
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.340]   They're like these effortless,
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.260]   less lifting off the ground,
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.940]   and power, and strength, and more timing,
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.500]   and position, movement, momentum,
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.660]   all this kind of stuff.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.620]   That's more traditionally associated with Japanese judo.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.740]   'Cause for Japanese judo, the traditional judo,
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.220]   you're supposed to throw people
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.500]   in a big way without much effort.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.980]   >> And of course, 1990 we saw the introduction
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.820]   of all these Eastern Bloc countries.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.820]   There were so many more.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.380]   I mean, it was Soviet Union when I was competing,
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.500]   and then of course in 1990, everything changed.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.060]   And then there were so many more of them out there,
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.140]   different countries,
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:05.140]   that their wrestling styles were introduced into judo.
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.340]   Put a jacket on them and let's get into judo.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.460]   So judo kind of changed shape.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.300]   It changed shape from this upright standing,
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.420]   and having to know the technicalities
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.500]   of how to get a body that's weighing 40,
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.380]   14 stone or whatever it is up into the air,
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.780]   and using the momentum, and the balance,
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.380]   and the direction, and the skill to do that,
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.460]   and knowing how to do it, and how to use movement.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.540]   And then you get the wrestlers,
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.180]   and the leg picks, and the double legs,
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.420]   single legs, double legs, and it kind of,
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:49.060]   by 1995, judo was bent over.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.420]   And so it was the IOC that went to IJF,
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.380]   International Judo Federation,
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.740]   and they said, you gotta change this,
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.060]   or we're just gonna have one wrestling style.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.820]   It looks like wrestling with judo,
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.660]   with judo jackets on.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.900]   So you either change it,
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.020]   or we're gonna take one of you out.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.300]   - By the way, we should sort of clarify,
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.340]   when we say people are bent over,
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.780]   that's usually how you see freestyle wrestling.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.020]   Wrestlers are more bent over
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.540]   to defend the legs and so on.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.940]   And traditional judo, people are more standing up
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.500]   because that's the position
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.700]   for which you can do the big throws
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.940]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.020]   But I think the other case to make
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.500]   for banning leg grabs is,
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.060]   a lot of people are using it for stalling
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.700]   and not for beautiful big throws
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.860]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.580]   So it's not just not to make it different from wrestling.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.140]   It's also like you want to maximize
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.100]   the amount of epic throws
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.860]   and dynamic judo and exciting stuff to watch, right?
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.940]   - Win by judo, not by wrestling.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.860]   And I think that the ones that were shouting about it
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.820]   were the wrestlers, right?
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.020]   Because they like to compete with both.
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.220]   They want to do both.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.420]   They want to do their wrestling matches
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.340]   and then come into judo.
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.620]   So basically, I mean, what we've said is,
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.940]   they learn to do judo
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.820]   and there's nothing stopping you then from doing both, right?
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.260]   But not from the other way around, all right?
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.580]   So rules always dictate development.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.900]   They'll always dictate which direction it goes.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.460]   So if you introduce a rule that states
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.460]   that you cannot dive at the legs and just pick up,
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.900]   then you'll have to do it standing up.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.340]   And also it increases the possibility of defense
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.820]   with the hips because actually good defense judo wise,
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.780]   standing up is with the hips
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.820]   as opposed to sticking your arms out
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.580]   and then sticking your backsides out there just to defend.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.780]   All right, so if you attack me
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.820]   and I move my body in the wrong place,
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.100]   so I'm in the wrong place at the right time,
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.660]   so you don't hit the right target.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.940]   And then also I use my hips.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.940]   So again, it's a form of judo that was being lost.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.220]   So now we've got it back.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.420]   - So let's go there.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.060]   Let's speak about judo
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.100]   as if we're talking to a group of five-year-olds.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.540]   So what is judo?
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.020]   What are some defining characteristics of judo as a sport,
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.460]   as a way, as a martial art, as a way of life,
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.420]   all that kind of stuff?
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.340]   - I think when you say it is a way of life,
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:26.340]   I mean, I think the great advantage that we have in judo,
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:32.220]   my young grandson, so I got two little boys
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.100]   that are three and a half years of age.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.620]   They love going to our dojo.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.660]   They love it.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.460]   So dojo was the first word that they used.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.740]   It was one of the first.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.580]   So when they come to see us,
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.380]   to see my wife and I, it's like dojo.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.580]   It's not grandma, granddad, it's a dojo.
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.580]   So dojo, they take their shoes off going into the dojo.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.980]   So they have respect for where they're at.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.060]   And I think it has that kind of feeling
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.100]   that like I tried to build my dojo
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.900]   with a feeling of reverence.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.420]   It's kind of almost peaceful.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.500]   So if I'm not religious, I'm not a religious person,
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.900]   but I like going to old churches
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.020]   because when I go into an old church,
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.420]   doesn't matter what the religion within the church,
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.980]   but there's a reverence in there.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.660]   - Reverence is a good word.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.660]   It feels like a really special place.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.180]   No matter which dojo you go to,
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.700]   it's just you bow and there's a calmness
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.140]   before the storm of battle or whatever it is.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.140]   (laughs)
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:32.980]   - And respect, you know?
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.820]   - Yeah, respect.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.860]   - I mean, look at the respect.
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.060]   We were just talking about it just before we came on air.
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.660]   We were just saying that we very, very seldom
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:46.660]   do we have a situation where there is animosity
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.700]   other than them fighting, you know?
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.060]   So I'm not saying that they don't fight each other
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.060]   because sometimes it does turn into a brawl.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:59.060]   And at the end, two people bow off and show their respect.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.940]   You know, and one of the things that, you know,
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.620]   like so a champion, I see people winning events
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.020]   and they're good judoka or they're excellent.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.780]   They win world championships,
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.300]   might even win the Olympic Games.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:18.300]   But a great champion for me is somebody who treats,
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.140]   who does the right thing when they lose, you know?
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.260]   So when you see them lose,
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.660]   that's when you see the true them, you know?
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.700]   And actually that was one of the biggest things
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.260]   that I had to really cope with, you know?
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.220]   So when I lost the Olympic Games in Moscow
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.100]   and also the one in Los Angeles,
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.900]   the hardest thing is when the microphone's in there
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:46.540]   and you've got to be respectful and nice
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.020]   and the hardest thing is to smile.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.460]   But actually some of the great champions, you know,
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.380]   they'll go, "That's just one match."
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.900]   You know, I remember we've got one great champion,
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.260]   Agbeg Nenu, she's a five-time world champion,
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.420]   she's an Olympic champion.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.900]   She's favorite as well to get this Olympic gold medal.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.300]   French.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.020]   What a great champion she is, you know,
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.060]   because she lost one of the matches.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.820]   I mean, she'd come back and she'd given birth,
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.340]   come back after giving birth
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.020]   and everybody was going, "Well, well, she," you know,
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.260]   but then she lost one of the matches on the way through
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.780]   and she said, "Oh, don't be upset.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.980]   "You know, it's just one match.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.340]   "It's just one contest, you know?
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.660]   "Next time I'm going to put it right."
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.260]   And she did put it right and now she's back up there
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.100]   and she won the world title back.
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.980]   So, you know, these are great champions for me.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.380]   - Yeah, I mean, that's the right way to see it,
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:49.700]   but it's also tragic to lose the Olympic Games, you know?
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.540]   - Twice.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.340]   (laughing)
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.380]   Yes, it is tragic.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.740]   And I do have sleepless nights.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.060]   - I mean, that's the magic of the Olympic Games.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.140]   Anything can happen.
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.980]   And your 1980 Olympics were very different from the 1984,
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.820]   but if we just linger on the '80
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.780]   and just your, when we're talking about
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.740]   how much you wanted to win,
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.780]   do you love winning or hate losing more?
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.660]   - I hate losing more, but I love winning.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.820]   When I won the world title a year later
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.380]   and I had no doubt when I went in that day
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.540]   that I was going to be world champion.
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.380]   No doubt.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.820]   - So you won the '81 world championship.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.220]   - At the higher weight.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.020]   - At the higher, the 78.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.940]   - Yes.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.780]   - KG.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.900]   Actually, can we go there?
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.260]   What was going through your mind?
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:50.260]   You ended up armbarring a Japanese fighter.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.180]   I talked to Jimmy Pedro, a friend of yours,
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.460]   somebody who said you were a mentor to him for many years,
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.340]   and he told me a bunch of different questions to ask you,
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.740]   but he said that was a really special time.
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:06.740]   That was a really special, dominant run you had,
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.420]   and especially finishing with an armbar
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.780]   against a Japanese player.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.740]   So take me through that.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.380]   What do you remember from that?
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.980]   - I think that it was, so my weight was better.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.140]   I didn't have to lose weight.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.100]   That was one thing.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.340]   So the nutritional side wasn't as important,
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.340]   but probably it still wasn't as good
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.860]   as it could be, mind you, in nutrition.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.700]   Although it was getting better,
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.980]   and I was trying to eat the right things at the right time.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:40.260]   But I still trained really well,
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.260]   and I was so confident going into that world championships
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.660]   that I could win it.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.260]   I had no doubt in my mind that I was gonna win,
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.300]   but obviously, corner of your mind,
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.980]   you're thinking just don't make mistakes.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.820]   But this is the incredible thing,
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.300]   is that once you start to ask you,
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.820]   once I see contests change direction when I'm commentating,
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.980]   so I can see somebody who's in there
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.100]   just going forward, just trying to win,
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.700]   and that's a difference to somebody who's trying not to lose.
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.620]   And there's two different ways there.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:20.140]   So sometimes when you, so when I was world champion,
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.500]   then I had a period of time
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.420]   where every time I stepped out there,
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.820]   I was really afraid of losing.
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.220]   And I think that that's what happens
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.060]   later on in your competitive career.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.580]   The great champions managed to come through that.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.180]   Teddy Rene is one of those.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.140]   He just, he puts it out there, and he keeps beating them,
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.820]   so they can't take it away from him.
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.540]   It's fantastic.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.100]   - So stepping on the mat every single encounter,
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.260]   you're trying to win.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.580]   You're looking for the grips
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.380]   and the intention to throw big,
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.820]   even when you're ahead on points,
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.340]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.420]   - That's a really good point,
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.900]   is that if you go ahead in a match
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.300]   and you look at the clock, it depends when you go ahead.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.940]   So sometimes you can go ahead in the first minute
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.900]   and you've still got three minutes to go.
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.300]   So I see the ones then that go into, I don't wanna lose,
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.740]   'cause they go into defensive mode,
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:15.500]   and then sometimes they can lose it on penalties
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.980]   or something can go wrong,
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.060]   and the other one comes on strong
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.780]   and then they can sneak the contest.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.380]   And so it's really difficult,
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.020]   but when I was coaching,
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:30.460]   I was trying to always encourage that positive attitude
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.260]   for the full four minutes, five minutes then.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.900]   - I've competed a lot in Judo and Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.580]   I've always hated that part of myself.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.860]   When I'm up on points by a lot,
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.340]   you look at the clock and it's what you do.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.500]   When you look at the clock,
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.500]   it's a minute and a half, you're really tired,
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.900]   and you kind of quit.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.140]   You just defend.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:49.980]   - Yeah.
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.100]   - And I hated that part about myself.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:52.940]   It's like that--
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:53.780]   - You're saying don't do it.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.140]   - Yeah, well, as opposed to just go out in Judo,
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.420]   that's for a big throw, just keep going for the throw.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.100]   In Jiu-Jitsu, it's go for the submission.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.580]   Like throw caution, like win in the real way
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.140]   versus on points, and I hated that part of myself.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.300]   I mean, mostly underneath that
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.020]   is cowardice induced by exhaustion.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.380]   - Exhaustion's the one, isn't it?
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.380]   - Yeah.
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.220]   - But it is, isn't it?
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.500]   It's a mindset as well.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.340]   - Yeah.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.100]   - So actually trying to get your mind
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.420]   positive all the way through.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.820]   So I mean, if you listen, when I commentate to Noah,
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.380]   is I say I hope that they don't change the mindset
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.780]   and that they keep on,
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.020]   and they are going forward all the time,
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.220]   and actually they're then more difficult to catch.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.380]   We had one just a couple of weeks ago,
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:45.380]   and he lost in the final second of the contest.
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.460]   Lost the final, he was the only one to score.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.140]   He got penalized all the way up.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.860]   Two seconds to go and stepped out of the area,
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.260]   and you know, but he went like that,
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.460]   thinking the bell was just going,
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:02.460]   and the bell went one second after he actually stepped out.
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.660]   So he got penalized, lost the match,
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.340]   and lost all of the points for qualification.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.380]   So it was, you know, that's paying high price.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.100]   That's paying high price.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.700]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a thin line
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:21.460]   between triumph and tragedy in those competitions,
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.140]   but especially at the Olympic Games.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.020]   So let's just stick on '81 World Championship.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.980]   What did it feel like to win that World Championship?
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.460]   Like, and also getting an armbar as a Japanese player.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.860]   Jimmy told me your arms were exhausted.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.740]   - Yeah, I mean, you just,
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.140]   the thing is, is sometimes, you know,
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.420]   when you're going, when it's competitive as well,
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.260]   you know, ours is a different intensity to like,
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.900]   do you just, where you can take time a little bit.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.660]   Ours is, bang, it's transitioning from standing down.
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.460]   You've got 10, 15 seconds to go in there.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.740]   You go in a hundred percent.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:01.340]   It's a bit like running, you know, full out for 10 seconds.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.700]   Like, and then you've got to decide then,
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.580]   especially if they're defending it,
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.780]   whether you let it go,
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.620]   because when you get up and your forearms are blown,
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.420]   you know, and you've got lactic acid in there
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.780]   and you've still got to grip up,
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.260]   because remember, ours is about gripping as well
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.340]   on the jacket.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.620]   So if you can't grip up,
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.260]   then you can't gain the advantage,
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.100]   then they can throw you, you know?
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.540]   So you have to decide.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.700]   So I had a massive attack on him
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.340]   and we changed directions four or five times
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.180]   and then I wasn't going to let him go.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.740]   But I still, you know, when I was turning him there,
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.860]   I had to decide, am I going to go all out for this?
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.740]   And just, or, you know, like,
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.580]   there has been occasions when I've kind of released it
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.860]   to just, you know, if I've got a minute to go
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.100]   and just lock out, yeah.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.540]   - So what you're saying on the feet,
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.660]   there was a change of direction
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.860]   on all different kinds of attempts
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.580]   and then you went to the ground and that's,
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.420]   so what was that?
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.340]   Do you remember that decision of like,
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.900]   okay, am I going to finish this?
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.740]   - Yeah, I knew it.
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.780]   I just, as soon as I climbed his back
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.460]   and then I thought he's not going,
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.180]   he's not going, I'm not going to let him up, you know?
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.540]   So I was just changing.
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.380]   - A little voice in your head.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.740]   - A little, something in my head was going,
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.660]   don't, don't, you know, just stick on him.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.780]   And then it's always about pressure on the arm
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.620]   and I just, you know, and of course he was like that,
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.620]   you know, defending, you know,
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.740]   he was almost total bridge trying to get out of it.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.500]   - Did it start in turtle and then like,
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.340]   did you flip him?
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.900]   - It started in turtle because I did an attack,
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.500]   came back out of the attack
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.980]   and then he went onto his front
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.620]   and then I was on his back
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.060]   and then I started the whole time.
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.820]   - Start opening and you just went for it?
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.180]   - Just, I was, it was an automatic transition.
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.540]   So, I mean, the transitions are what we teach,
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.220]   you know, because the ones that are quicker down
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.460]   with the transitions are the ones that catch it.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.460]   That's our (indistinct)
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.100]   You know, our groundwork is the transition
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.820]   from standing down to ground.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.180]   It's very, you know, we don't have a situation
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.740]   where you can kind of work your way in.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.300]   You are in or you're not in, you're standing, you know?
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.100]   So, you've got to make sure that you're in.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.980]   And so, I had, I was just on his back like a leech
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.140]   and I never let him go.
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.100]   - So, you see, I mean, yeah.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.300]   So, that's where the arm bars,
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.140]   that's where the attacks on the ground,
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.060]   which is called Niwaza happens in the transition.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:20.940]   - Yes. - At that level,
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.860]   at that high world-class level?
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.700]   - Yeah, I mean, he was no muggy though.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.580]   I think he'd just got third place
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.540]   in the all Japan championships,
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.380]   which is all weight categories.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.820]   So, he wasn't a mug, you know, he was strong
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.860]   and I'd fought him once before
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.300]   and I knew he was a lefty as well,
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.100]   which was really awkward for me.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.020]   - Did it feel good?
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.620]   - Better for me than him.
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.460]   - Did it?
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.380]   - It did, it felt amazing, you know,
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.860]   because it was almost like all these things,
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:54.020]   disappointments and everything had kind of come
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.460]   to this one point where I was at last
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.220]   kind of champion of the world.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.420]   It's everything I said as a kid,
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:04.540]   that I had no idea how difficult it was going to be.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.700]   You know, so as a kid, as a 14-year-old kid,
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.860]   I remember saying, "I'm going to be world champion.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.580]   "I'm going to be the best in the world."
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.380]   I had no idea how difficult that was going to be.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.780]   - Well, there's wisdom to that, right?
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.420]   Like there's power in stupidity of youth.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.260]   - I like that.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.220]   - Right? - Yeah, it is.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.460]   - Just like I'm going to be a world champion,
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.140]   I'm going to win this without knowing how hard it is.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:29.140]   And then once you go after it, you're trapped.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.340]   You're going to have to do the work.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.620]   - Yeah, well, I mean, you see it a lot with parents as well.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.340]   You know, parents, "Our little Johnny is amazing."
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.340]   And he's this, that, and the other,
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.380]   and they have no idea what's out there.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.700]   I remember the very first time I stepped out, 1974,
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.380]   into the European cadets.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.060]   And I remember that we were fighting.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.900]   I'd only ever fought in Great Britain.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:58.900]   I was the top, you know, I was unbeaten in the juniors, kids,
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.940]   and went out there and there were these
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.540]   different fighters out there
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.140]   that were treating me with total disdain.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.300]   And I remember thinking, "How dare they?"
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:15.300]   You know, and I realized when I came back from that event,
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.300]   there's other people out there.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.820]   There's just a whole, you know,
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.700]   and there are different levels of, you know,
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.180]   the majority of people are just not informed
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.380]   as to what's out there and the different levels
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.740]   that there are out there.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.340]   - Do you remember like a certain opponent
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.980]   that for the first time you felt like, "Holy shit."
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:34.820]   - Yeah.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.820]   - There's pop, like somebody's just gripped you up
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.460]   and you're like, "This is,
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.940]   there's another level to this game."
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.900]   - Ed Zio was, Ed Zio was one of them.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.980]   And I fought him, you know,
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.340]   and I beat him in the European championships.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.260]   I beat him in, you know, two times
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.180]   and then lost to him in the Olympic games
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.300]   two months after I'd beaten him
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.860]   in the European championship.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.700]   - Wow.
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.340]   That made it even more difficult, right?
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.220]   - That's literally your nemesis there.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.460]   - Yeah. - Wow.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.500]   - So that made it more difficult.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:08.300]   And so Ed Zio was one and getting hold of,
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:13.300]   I remember getting hold of Nishida of Japan
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.820]   and he had me going up and down
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.420]   and I just, I thought, "Wow, this guy is amazing."
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.020]   You know, and I'd never fought,
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.180]   first time I ever fought Japanese in a major tournament,
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.340]   you know, and I felt the danger.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.780]   I always talk about the danger
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.300]   when we go out to Japan to train.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:37.980]   I could go probably months without getting thrown
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.340]   in training here in Europe and I go to Japan
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.500]   and, you know, everybody's throwing you, you know,
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.980]   and that's difficult to accept.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.180]   And the reason that that kind of danger
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   and that kind of feeling of danger
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.940]   is something that puts a real edge on, you know,
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.620]   and so that was first time when I got hold of Nishida,
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.220]   I thought, "Oh my God, you know, this guy, you know,
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.420]   "didn't matter which way he was turning like that,
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.860]   "he'd be stretched out."
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.300]   And I thought this, I wanna do this, you know,
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.300]   and then I ended up fighting him again in Japan.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.500]   - So that feeling of danger is really interesting.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:19.380]   It's like I've, you know, did Ran Dory
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.620]   with a lot of world-class people
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.060]   from different parts of the world,
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.740]   including Ilyas Iliadis, and like there's certain part,
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.380]   like Eastern European Judo,
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.540]   you feel like you're screwed the whole way through.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.380]   Like the gripping, you really feel it in the gripping.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.540]   - It's the gripping that does it.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:41.420]   - But with Japanese, like really good Japanese-style Jidoka,
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.180]   you don't, it's like, it's a terrifying calmness,
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.420]   or at least the experiences I've had,
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.140]   you don't really feel it in the gripping.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.300]   You just feel like anywhere you step, you're getting thrown.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.380]   - It's a different.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.420]   - It's a different thing, isn't it?
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.260]   - It's a different thing.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.060]   - So, I mean, mine was kind of a mixture.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.780]   I liked it to be a mixture because there was,
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.740]   the gripping is definitely the key point.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.940]   So if you get a high-level guys that are gripping up,
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.180]   and I always used to put this to the referees
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.180]   when we were doing referee seminars
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.900]   when we first started them.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.100]   And I'd say, how many, because like they would referee
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.940]   to their understanding of the match.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.780]   So they were penalizing for certain grips that were,
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:28.780]   and actually, so as an ex-athlete, high-level,
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:33.100]   I would say, have you ever gripped up with high-level?
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.340]   All right, because if you haven't, you need to do it,
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.540]   because then you will understand why
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.180]   they do certain things with the grips,
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:44.140]   because these guys are like, when somebody grips you
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.300]   and you think, you know you're gonna go,
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.140]   when Iliadis puts his arm over your back, all right,
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.660]   and you know you're gonna go up and over.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.580]   You know you're gonna go over, you know, that's it.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.260]   - It's a cool feeling.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.580]   It's like whenever-- - Not for me.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.300]   - I understand, but it's like, I mean, 'cause it's not,
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.540]   it feels way more powerful than it should.
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.620]   - Yeah. - It's weird.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:08.260]   I don't know, you want to attribute it to strength
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.260]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.340]   I mean, people say you have like immense upper body strength,
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.340]   but it's probably something else.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.380]   It's like technique, it's some kind of weird--
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.460]   - It's a mix of everything.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.220]   - Just like something hardened through lots of battles
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.820]   and Randori and that kind of stuff.
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:23.660]   - Yeah. - But it's cool
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.300]   that humans are able to generate that kind of power.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.140]   It's cool.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.300]   - When I was, '84 Olympics,
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.460]   but I'm just gonna go there now just quickly.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.820]   But there was, we had a freestyle wrestler.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:41.180]   He's American actually, but he had the English nationality.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.780]   So he competed for Noel Loban, his name is,
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.420]   and he competed for Great Britain.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:50.020]   He got third place at the Olympics in '84,
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.700]   but he was training.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.820]   We were training at Budokai and he was training.
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.300]   He came to do some judo and put jacket on.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.540]   And of course he was training with some of the lower levels
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.020]   and he was really handling himself well.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.220]   And then he said, "I need to feel."
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:12.820]   When we did Randori, so he did some Randori with me
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:16.260]   and I immediately thought, I gotta catch it.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.540]   I gotta stop single leg and double leg
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.260]   'cause he was really quick, right?
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.340]   So strong as well, 90 something kilos.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.900]   He was like, you know, he's a big guy.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.820]   So I caught his sleeve, immediately caught
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:32.380]   and controlled him and then he couldn't start, right?
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.580]   So he said, "I needed to feel the difference."
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:40.340]   So then I thought, I better reciprocate this.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.060]   So I said, well, you know, so we did the Randori
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.300]   and I threw him a couple of times.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.180]   He said, "I'm really glad we did that."
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.540]   So then I said, "I need to feel the difference as well."
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.860]   So we take the jackets off.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:53.140]   So we took the jackets off and he was a nightmare.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.980]   This guy was a nightmare and like a monster,
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.500]   you know, he was like single legging me
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.700]   and you know, it was just totally different, you know?
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.700]   So it was like the jacket makes a massive difference,
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.980]   huge difference to something, you know,
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:12.900]   and people think it's just a jacket that we're wearing,
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.140]   but it isn't, it's our only tool.
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:16.980]   - Excellent.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.380]   - Yeah, and it's control.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.500]   I mean, it's a way of establishing control over another body
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.660]   and it's a whole art form and a science.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.060]   And I don't even know if you understand it really,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:31.780]   you understand it sort of subconsciously through time.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:32.620]   - Yeah.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:33.980]   - 'Cause like there's so much involved
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.460]   'cause pulling on one part of the jacket
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.140]   pulls other parts of the jacket.
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:37.980]   - Yeah.
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.460]   - Like the physics of that is probably insane to understand.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.580]   - It's absolutely insane.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.420]   And then, you know, they changed the rules for a little while
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:47.500]   and they changed the rules so that you couldn't hold,
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.780]   you know, that certain grips were not allowed.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.740]   You only allowed a certain amount of time
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.820]   and there were a lot of penalties from it, you know?
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.260]   And then, you know, they had some of the X fighters
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.500]   into the referee commission.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:05.900]   And so we were pushing for, just let them grip, you know?
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.980]   Because that's our game, you know?
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.460]   That's what makes us different.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.540]   You know, again, if grip up with somebody like,
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.860]   so they were on about Teddy Rene.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.700]   - Yeah.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.180]   - Teddy Rene comes out, takes the sleeve.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.020]   - Yeah.
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.020]   - Big arm over the top and then, you know,
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:20.940]   he throws people, right?
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:23.060]   So they were saying, yeah, but stop,
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.060]   you can't stop him doing it.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:29.620]   This guy is six foot nine and he is built like Garth,
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.900]   you know, he's like, and not only that,
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.260]   he's skillful as well, you know?
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.460]   And he's got that mentality of a winner.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.500]   He has got that mentality of a winner there.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.540]   He just wins important matches.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.020]   - And he goes over the top of the grip.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:46.020]   Do they, where's that land now in terms of rules
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.020]   over the top?
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.460]   'Cause those are some of the most epic,
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.100]   awesome types of grips.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:50.940]   - Yeah.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.060]   - Just like over the top, just big grab.
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:53.900]   - Yeah.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.820]   Well, as long as they throw from it,
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.380]   so they can take any grip, as long as you move them
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.500]   and then catch them, kind of action reaction, really,
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.660]   you know, as long as you catch them on the move,
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:05.500]   then you can do it.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.500]   - So as long as you're not using it to stall
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.340]   or that kind of stuff.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.540]   - Yeah, you can't block out.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.380]   - Yeah.
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.940]   So like, for example, if I've got dominant grip on you
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:19.300]   and I just block out and I just stop you attacking me,
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.140]   so then what?
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.260]   I get you three penalties, get you off,
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.700]   and you haven't done an attack.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:25.700]   So you've got to stop that.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.540]   You can't have that.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.460]   - Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:31.700]   You were the favorite to win the 1984 Olympics,
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.140]   but you got silver.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.460]   I watched that match several times.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.500]   You probably have it playing in your head.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.660]   So there is a nice change of direction by your opponent,
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.940]   German Frank Wonecki.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:45.780]   - Yeah.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.380]   - It was a fake right uchimata,
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.940]   and then to a left drop seoi nage.
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.780]   How did that loss feel?
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:00.380]   - Devastating is not, you know, is not enough, really.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.820]   Because, you know, the strange thing was,
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.220]   is coming into that Olympics, I was tired, really tired.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.780]   So my mental state wasn't the best,
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.060]   wasn't certainly the same as it was coming into the previous
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:20.780]   and I remember thinking I just need to get this over with
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:24.140]   and then I'm gonna have a break and just have a rest,
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.940]   you know, and that's totally the wrong attitude.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:31.700]   It's just not good for going into an Olympic Games.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.700]   And so I was coming in there with a different mindset
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:42.460]   and I remember every match that I had, I was winning well,
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.140]   but I was winning with a struggle.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:50.740]   You know, it was really not, I'd fought Novak
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.220]   and I was pretty of France,
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.860]   who was one of the strongest physically.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.180]   That was in the quarterfinals.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:01.020]   I beat Brett Barron by an ippon, I armlocked him.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:05.420]   I won my first match by ippon as well.
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:09.980]   And then Michel Novak, I was fighting a France
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.420]   and I was lucky to win it.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.740]   I was up, I would scored on him,
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.100]   but I was like starting to defend
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.220]   and just everything that I talked to you about, you know,
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.140]   and then just about held on and then I won.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.180]   And, you know, so him and I were talking afterwards,
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:27.380]   like some years afterwards and he said,
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.540]   "I was close, wasn't I?"
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.580]   I was, "Yeah, but not close enough."
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.740]   (all laughing)
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.580]   I didn't mean it.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.420]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.940]   - But I had to say it, right?
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.380]   - Of course, of course.
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.180]   - And no, he was right.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.620]   You know, and it was one of those,
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.820]   so it's through to the semifinal.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.780]   I fought Lesac in the semifinal of,
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:53.060]   and I'd fought him in the semifinal of the Worlds as well.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.980]   I'd never gone time with him.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.940]   You know, I'd never, I'd always beaten him fairly easily
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:03.580]   and with by ippon and that went time.
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.860]   So I was, you know, I was just glad to get it done.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:10.500]   And I was in the final then against Frank Winnicker
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.260]   of Germany and I'd beaten Winnicker before,
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.740]   but he was just a young German coming through.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:20.060]   And when I started the final, I was, I thought, right,
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:24.700]   I've just, and I started all my techniques
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.020]   just that little bit off.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:30.020]   Nothing was coordinated, just, it was just,
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.860]   I can't really explain why it was just a little bit off.
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:36.700]   And I see it so often now with a lot of the guys
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.140]   that are going for second, third Olympic games.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:42.540]   And I see their technique just not quite there
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.500]   and they're struggling.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.140]   And I know when they're, you know,
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.100]   I know what they're going through
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.260]   and I kind of empathize with them.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.580]   - Well, you were, it felt like you were
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:50.620]   dominating that final.
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.340]   - I dominated it, yeah, I was winning.
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.580]   Yeah, I was, and actually,
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.780]   if it had gone another minute and a half,
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.780]   it would have been all over
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.220]   and I would have been Olympic champion
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:59.220]   and it would have been done.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.860]   He wouldn't have batted an eyelid, right?
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.540]   'Cause he would have fought me really, really well.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.700]   And he would have, you know,
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:06.900]   we talked about it afterwards
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.780]   and he said it was just my good day for me, you know,
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.100]   and he knows, he was very respectful.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.700]   This guy is very respectful.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.260]   - He was surprised almost.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.300]   I mean, not almost, he was very surprised
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.220]   and celebrating like a surprise.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.500]   - Jumping up and down like, you know, he just,
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.420]   and you look at that, can't you go,
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.340]   well, it was a nip on, but, you know,
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.540]   would I have got it back?
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:28.380]   I don't know.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:32.020]   I think that actually taking the pressure off,
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.660]   'cause that was another thing as well,
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.580]   pressure of being favorite, you know,
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.500]   and I see that with a lot of them.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.540]   And, you know, the great champions,
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.340]   the ones that keep coming through, Capellic.
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:45.220]   There's a guy, you know, he can look very ordinary
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.540]   and then comes the big tournament and he'll win it.
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:54.300]   - The tragedy of the Olympic Games.
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.340]   I mean, you were the favorite and just like that,
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.660]   like split moment, you lost it.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.820]   - Split moment, devastated.
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:06.180]   And lived it probably, not every day,
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.180]   but you know, Nikki, my wife will tell you
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:14.180]   that woken up in sweats and, you know,
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.940]   and I think they contributed as well
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.100]   because I had a period of my life
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.700]   after where I was drinking too much.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:26.220]   And, you know, and I think kind of when I look back,
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:30.860]   kind of led into that kind of dark period of my life,
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.180]   you know, and I never ever, ever, you know,
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.620]   did it go through my mind, anything else,
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.860]   but it definitely affected me.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:41.860]   And I was on a downward kind of spiral
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:45.580]   in a lot of different ways and would still,
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.460]   even, you know, we have an amazing marriage
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:52.380]   and we have an amazing family and everything's great,
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.260]   but I still wake up sometimes and I'll say,
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.020]   I've just dreamt, you know, that,
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.460]   and it's the same reoccurring dream
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.340]   where I'm trying to get somewhere
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.180]   and I'm trying to put it right, you know,
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:05.700]   and I've got this chance of putting
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.500]   this Olympic final right, you know,
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.260]   in this dream, I've got a chance of doing it,
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.820]   but I can't get there and the traffic's stopping me
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.020]   or something stops me and I, you know,
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.940]   and then I wake up and I'm sweating and I just,
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.020]   and you think, well, after all this time,
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.860]   that's not possible, but it is, and it happens.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.460]   - Yeah, I mean, in the match itself,
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.900]   there's that feeling, for me just watching it,
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.100]   like you're going for throws,
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.340]   you're almost getting there with the throws
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:34.420]   and it's almost like he's going for a kind of crap
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.460]   Uchimata and then you're just like,
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.100]   you're stopping, you're blocking it,
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:39.780]   and all of a sudden, I mean,
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.100]   that's the beauty of the Olympics,
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:44.540]   he finds it in himself to switch.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.380]   - Yeah. - And that, like,
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.780]   against a favorite, against sort of
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.620]   the great British Judoka,
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.220]   just finds the perfect drops in Auggie.
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:59.140]   - Well, you know, his team doctor and coach,
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.500]   he came up to me afterwards and said,
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.020]   "I'm just really sorry."
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.140]   And that's all they said is, "I'm just really sorry."
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.820]   They were sorry because, you know,
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:10.220]   obviously, the obvious sadness about that, you know,
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.740]   and of course, everybody takes their,
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:16.700]   you know, I went actually two and a,
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:20.700]   was it three weeks later, the German Open.
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.980]   So he had to compete in the German Open three weeks later.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:26.540]   So I went over to fight him
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:31.980]   and beat him in the final of the German Open.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.020]   And it didn't do anything for me
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.980]   'cause it was a much tighter match.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:37.140]   He was a lot closer.
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.380]   He had a lot more confidence coming in.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.940]   So he fought me a lot differently.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.460]   And then it was me pulling it back
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.100]   and just managing to win in the final.
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.940]   And I thought, well, that might appease,
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:50.980]   it appeased nothing, didn't do anything.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.620]   - When you give your whole life to judo,
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:56.420]   just, and your love of winning,
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.700]   that's crazy how much the Olympic Games mean.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.620]   - It means so much.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.860]   And I think, you know, but I've got to,
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:06.300]   and I've got to say this, and this is honestly, you know,
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.740]   if it meant that if I'd have won that Olympic Games
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:11.740]   and it had to change my life into a different direction,
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.860]   which I probably would have not competed
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.900]   in the '88 Olympic Games then,
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.860]   all right, so if it had changed my life
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:20.220]   and then I didn't have, I didn't meet my wife
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.980]   and I, you know, didn't have my family that I've got now,
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:27.220]   there's no, you know, I wouldn't swap that,
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:29.420]   what I've got now for anything.
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.940]   - Well, part of the demons that you've gotten to know
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.700]   because of those losses is part of probably
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:40.060]   the central reason that made you the man you are,
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:41.700]   a legend of the sport.
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.460]   You could have been not that.
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:47.340]   'Cause an Olympic gold is just an Olympic gold.
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.340]   - Yeah, and it is, isn't it?
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.300]   You know, and I think that there's a lot
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.140]   of Olympic champions and world champions
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:57.300]   that win and then are forgotten.
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:02.580]   And I said to Nikki, I said, my wife, I said,
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:05.900]   I don't want to be forgotten and I want to be remembered.
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.980]   So if I'm going to do anything, anything I do,
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.140]   if I'm going to do commentary or whatever it is,
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:14.300]   or coaching, I want to do coaching to a high level.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:17.180]   And I want to commentate at a high level.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.060]   I remember the first commentary I ever did,
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:19.900]   it was terrible.
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:23.420]   And I just thought I've got to do better than this.
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:28.060]   And I thought, I just, I need to do it well.
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:29.780]   And I've got to do it professionally.
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:33.380]   - So in the book, "A Game of Throws,"
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.100]   you have a chapter titled "Lessons in Losing."
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.580]   So what are some of the lessons here?
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.740]   What are some of the deeper lessons
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.500]   you've pulled out of losing?
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:46.180]   - I think great champions are made up of the people
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:49.020]   that handle it in the right way.
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:52.900]   And you could say, well, I don't like losing.
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:56.180]   And you know, and you could throw your dummy out the pram
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:59.860]   and you can be a bad loser in front of everybody.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.660]   And actually people pick up on that very, very quickly.
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.740]   You know what it's like in broadcasting, right?
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:08.580]   Somebody has a bad word to say about somebody and yeah.
[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:12.580]   And it, but actually the ones that endear themselves to you
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.420]   are the ones that handle it in the right way,
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:16.260]   the correct way.
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:17.940]   It doesn't mean that you've got to like it.
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.460]   I didn't like it.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:24.260]   And I thought that I handled it certainly in later years
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.900]   in the right way.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:29.020]   And I like to see athletes do it in the right way.
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:32.580]   You know, and I think that it's a make or break situation.
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:34.300]   It's not all the contests they win,
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.620]   it's the one that they lose.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:37.180]   And then how they pick themselves up
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:39.260]   and handle themselves after.
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:42.180]   So I think that that is a big one for me.
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.060]   And also, I mean, I went through, you know,
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:51.060]   obviously a later divorce and that was difficult on my son,
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.540]   really difficult on Ashley.
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:57.020]   And then I was, and I think that some of that
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.660]   was the fact that I was, you know, kind of,
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:01.460]   I wasn't drinking all the time,
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.180]   but I was drinking in excess at the wrong times, you know?
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.980]   And I think that that's what a lot of people do.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:10.620]   Sometimes is that they use it for the wrong reasons,
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:12.660]   you know, and I used to hear it.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.820]   I hear it now all the time, you know,
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.220]   and is that, you know, I need to knock the edge off
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.660]   and I need to just forget.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.780]   And I need to, you know,
[00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:25.220]   and you need to be in a fuzzy place for a while.
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:28.380]   And I had a lot of time in fuzzy place
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:29.900]   and I needed to get rid of that, you know,
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.460]   and I needed to clear my head.
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.820]   - Where was that place?
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:37.980]   Some of the lower points in your life
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.660]   that you've reached mentally?
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.940]   - I think, you know, definitely, you know,
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:48.940]   the fact that my marriage, first marriage didn't work,
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:52.780]   you know, and that was, you know,
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.700]   it's a mix of things that, you know, between us.
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:57.620]   And then, you know,
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:01.260]   so that's not where I wanted to be at the time.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:06.180]   And the effects that it had on my son,
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:09.900]   and it took a long time for him then
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.220]   to come around and to trust me again,
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.340]   you know, and to have belief.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.980]   He always had belief in me, but to trust me again.
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:21.780]   And then I think that that was low.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.460]   And I think that, you know, when I look back
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:27.100]   is that a lot of my bad decisions
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:30.220]   were when I was in that fuzzy kind of haze
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:32.940]   and that it got progressively worse.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:36.260]   That got progressively worse to the degree
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:39.180]   where it was, you know, trying to hide it
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:41.460]   and trying to hide how much.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:46.460]   And I was kind of a functioning kind of drunk.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:49.380]   You know, I think you could probably say that.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:50.980]   And I, you know, I was functioning.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:54.940]   I was still able to, I was still training most days,
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:55.940]   crazily enough.
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:59.540]   You know, I was training to kind of mask it and cover it.
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.620]   And that was probably my savior that I was still,
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:04.700]   you know, 'cause I remember I said to my wife,
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:07.700]   I said to Nikki, "I'm probably the fittest.
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.140]   "If I'm, you know, a drunk,
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.340]   "then I'm a fittest drunk in the world."
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.620]   She said, "Yeah, you probably are actually."
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.500]   You know, I was in great condition for a drunk.
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:20.020]   - So the fuzzy haze, where was your mind?
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:23.060]   Did you have periods of depression?
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:27.420]   - I had periods of depression.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:31.580]   I can honestly say that my depression wasn't that bad.
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.580]   Although I did, you know, when it's like anything
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.100]   that gives you an up, you know,
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:38.660]   it gives you an even bigger down, doesn't it?
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:42.420]   You know, and so I hated that feeling
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:46.780]   and also hated myself for letting it happen
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:50.420]   because I have got this really, it's a bizarre,
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:54.220]   I don't know whether you can call it a power,
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:58.540]   but I have the ability to be able to say, "Stop."
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:02.700]   And I can just, and that's what I did in the end.
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.540]   In the end, there was an incident
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.380]   when I was working for Belgian Judo
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.500]   and there was an incident, it was Christmas.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.660]   It was, I tell you exactly the day.
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:17.660]   It was 20th of December and me and a Belgian coach,
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:21.340]   we got absolutely hammered.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.820]   But we were at the wrong place and he got noticed
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:28.820]   and so I remember they pulled me up in front of this board
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:32.460]   and I looked down at these guys
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.660]   and half of them were people I didn't want to be
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:37.900]   in that situation with.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:40.060]   You know, they're not people that I respected
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.460]   and they're not people that I trusted.
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:49.220]   So I said, "If you're gonna sack me, sack me,
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:53.500]   "but I'll promise you now that I will just,
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.820]   "this is it, I'll stop.
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:56.020]   "I'm just gonna stop."
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:57.700]   I've decided.
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:02.220]   On the way back in the car, I rang Nicky up, my wife,
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.820]   and I said, "Whatever you hear now, whatever,
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.540]   "I'm just gonna stop."
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.260]   So that was it, stopped.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:14.700]   - You just saw the moment and said, "Stop."
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.620]   - Stop.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:19.260]   - So that fuzzy place, what advice could you give to people
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:24.100]   how to overcome that dark place, the depression,
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.540]   whether it has to do with drinking or not?
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.380]   - I think if it's to do with drinking,
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:37.020]   all I can say is that the two days or a week
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.740]   into not drinking, you'll feel different.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.420]   You know, it'll make a physical difference
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.060]   and you'll like that physical difference.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.460]   And then from a mental perspective as well,
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:54.460]   because I think that you have a massive downer.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:59.500]   And I think that that must be because of drugs as well,
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.540]   because I had a situation with my brother.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:05.500]   He was like professional wrestling
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.540]   and the drugs was an element there.
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.220]   And so I'd never touched a drug
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:14.140]   or even seen one in my life.
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:17.860]   But I'd let the alcohol side go too far
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.140]   and then decided never to do that.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.220]   So then I guess I had people ringing me up,
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.940]   saying, "How can we stop?"
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:29.100]   So when they say, "Can I have a word?
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.420]   Can I discuss something with you?"
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:35.660]   And I know then what they wanna discuss with me.
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.620]   And the thing is, is that I would say,
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:43.780]   if you stop, then feel the effects of it
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.900]   and it will make a difference to your everyday life
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.260]   and that will make a massive difference.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:53.660]   And I think about anybody who kind of is down all the time
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:57.380]   is to find the cause of what's pushing you down,
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.220]   you know what I mean?
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:02.940]   And try and attack that.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.380]   I mean, because it's never...
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.940]   Somebody once said to me, they said,
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:12.220]   "Whatever you got, we've got something special.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.300]   I mean, we have a great life
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.140]   and I've had a great competition record."
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:21.620]   You know, it could have been better, but it was great.
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.820]   But I've had success with my business
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:29.060]   and we're still out there and we have a great life.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.660]   We travel all the world.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:34.060]   And there's people out there that would live in your house
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.100]   at the drop of a hat, wherever you are.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:39.620]   They drive your car, no matter what car it is.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.900]   Some people haven't got a car, you know?
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.220]   And whatever food you're having
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.220]   and you're moaning about food, right?
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.180]   Somebody out there that would take that
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.900]   and gladly eat that, all right?
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.220]   So there's always somebody worse off than you.
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:55.740]   And I think that we tend to sometimes, you know,
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.540]   look at the things that we haven't got
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.020]   rather than the things we have got.
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:02.220]   - Yeah, it's a skill probably to be grateful
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:04.460]   for the things you have, exactly as you said.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.860]   And sometimes the little things like food
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:11.220]   and cars and all that kind of stuff,
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.820]   just to have gratitude for.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.580]   And family, all this kind of stuff.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.980]   But it's still, you know,
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.460]   having talked to a bunch of Olympic athletes,
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:24.900]   there is a, you know, when you give so much of your life
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.740]   to winning and then you lose,
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.000]   sometimes even when you win,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.220]   but when you lose at the very top,
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.740]   it's a tough, tough, like tough thing to go through.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:40.580]   - The most difficult thing, I think, for anybody
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.740]   is when they have to decide when to stop.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:46.980]   - You know, and all of a sudden,
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.220]   and I see the ones that are going to second Olympic Games
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.500]   and then third Olympic,
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.300]   and the ones that are there and they're holding on
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:57.620]   and they're in their thirties now,
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:00.580]   different to when they were 19 years of age,
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.780]   you know, 30 something is different to 19.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.340]   And then what are you going to do afterwards?
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.340]   You know, and then how do you become just a normal person?
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:13.220]   You're never going to be a normal person as such,
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.500]   but I think you've got to do normal things, you know,
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.100]   and then you've got, I remember the first time
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.140]   that when I finished competition, I had good sponsors.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.100]   This was, you know, 40 years ago,
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.020]   but I had two really good sponsorships,
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:30.540]   Vitamin Company and also Judo Gi Company.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.880]   And I had a car and, you know, I had money.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.260]   I just, and I was going all over the world.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:38.540]   I was successful.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:42.300]   And then I stopped and they took everything back.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.340]   They took my car.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:46.140]   They did, and they did it within two weeks as well.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.460]   They stopped my funding.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.660]   They, you know, and the Vitamin Company said,
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:50.540]   thank you very much.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:53.280]   It's been a great, you know, we've done well by you.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.140]   Bye-bye.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.620]   - This was after your last Olympics.
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.620]   - '88 Olympics.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.460]   - Yeah, '88.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.300]   - You know, when that finished and then that was it,
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.500]   you know, and then it's right, okay.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.220]   First time I had to go in there and buy a track suit
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.460]   and a pair of training shoes.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:08.380]   - Yeah.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.220]   - Wow.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.420]   - Yeah, those are different.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:13.220]   Sitting there in the evening by yourself.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.260]   - So you go from seven days a week or six days a week
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.940]   going into the gym and, you know,
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:21.060]   you're working out the dojo and then you,
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:22.860]   then you don't have to do it.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:25.580]   You know, and that's why you get a lot of,
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.420]   when they finish competition,
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:30.180]   they finish that 30 to 40.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.860]   It's still, I mean, Ilyas is still doing it now.
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.500]   He's still in there and he's still, you know,
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.700]   because he can, right?
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.620]   Okay, and it's natural.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:40.660]   And I did exactly the same.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.620]   And then, like I say, you just get to an age
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:45.220]   and you just think, well, I'm just gonna kind of
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.980]   take a step back.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:49.140]   - Which is why, like, there's certain athletes
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:52.940]   like Ryo Kotani, never stops.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.980]   It just dominates for 14 years.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:00.020]   Probably one of the winningest athletes in judo.
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:00.860]   - Yeah.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:03.140]   - Seven-time world champ, two-time Olympic champ,
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:05.460]   medaled at five Olympics.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.380]   So it's always impressive.
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:07.540]   - Never stopped.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.940]   - Never stopped.
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:12.580]   So that's an option, if you're like the greatest ever.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.420]   - Be interesting, wouldn't it,
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.580]   just to see what they're doing now, you know?
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.780]   Because at some stage, you have to get a normal job.
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:18.620]   - You do have to stop.
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:21.020]   - You do have to stop, you know, at some stage.
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:23.860]   You have to decide what you're gonna do, you know?
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.020]   And we, you know, it's either into coaching,
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:28.500]   the judo is either to coaching,
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.980]   or if you're not in coaching, then it's into
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.740]   something to do with the media.
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:37.780]   And, you know, I was lucky that I,
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.340]   it was just by accident, really, with the commentary.
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:43.700]   Somebody said, "Would you do a voiceover?"
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.900]   So I did this voiceover, and that was back in 1982,
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.220]   I did that.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:52.300]   - So you've been commentating since 1982.
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.500]   - I did some voiceovers.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.820]   I wouldn't call it commentating.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.940]   But I did some voiceovers, and then I did some,
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:02.420]   we did some different European Championships,
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.180]   World Championship kind of events,
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.940]   and I did the voiceovers for it.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:11.860]   And the way that it was done, that it was more narration.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.860]   And so it kind of turned into,
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.180]   then somebody asked me to do an event,
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.500]   and when you listen to the intonation of the voice
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.340]   and stuff like that, it wasn't like it is now.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:25.300]   But I guess that's just something that developed,
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.460]   as I, you know, because then it was coming from the heart.
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:32.100]   And I started to get excited and just do my thing,
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.140]   and it was just me, really, it was just my style.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:37.060]   - Well, I've listened to your commentary from a while back,
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:40.060]   I don't know if it's the '80s, but it's still there.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:41.860]   - I think it's timing as well, isn't it?
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.500]   It's like, you know, you get your timing a bit better,
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:47.780]   and know when to go in, when to come out,
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.860]   when to say something, when not, you know?
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.660]   And I think that in the early days,
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:57.220]   I tended to think, I tended to want to talk all the time,
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.980]   and you don't have to do that.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:01.300]   - Also knowing when to shut up.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.740]   - That's the key, isn't it?
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.500]   - Yeah, part of the drama is in the silence,
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.540]   building up to the setup and the throw
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:09.740]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:14.740]   But also, you're very good at, while radiating passion,
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:18.260]   being very precise and specific about the details
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.420]   of the throw and the setup,
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.300]   and why something worked and didn't, so.
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:25.100]   - Yeah, I think there's two kinds of commentating.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.460]   You can commentate what you see,
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:31.420]   and then you commentate what people can't see, you know?
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:35.260]   And so if you've got somebody that is not really understanding
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.140]   of what's happening in the inner part of the game,
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.820]   so it might be a technical thing,
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:43.900]   or it might be the tactical part of the play here
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:47.980]   that's going on, and if you can introduce that as well,
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:49.500]   then you've got an advantage.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.380]   - Quick pause, I need a bathroom break.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.820]   - Okay, good stuff.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:59.340]   So we just took a little break and went to judotv.com,
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:02.020]   which is, I guess, an IGF website.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.940]   IGF is the organization behind
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:06.380]   a lot of the big judo events in the world.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:07.540]   And I just signed up.
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.100]   You should sign up too, it's great.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.820]   - Absolutely, sign up.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.860]   Cheaper the price, cheaper the price.
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:13.700]   - Yeah.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.820]   And you can watch basically any match
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.740]   from the Grand Slams and go back through history, I guess.
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.260]   - Yeah, I've gotta say, Lex, I mean, everybody,
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.740]   there's still people saying to me,
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.420]   "Oh, we need more judo on television."
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.980]   They've got judo on television every other week
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:31.980]   that they can access.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:35.300]   All of the top people in all the top events,
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:39.980]   and it costs $100 a year to access everything.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.620]   And they can play all the videos.
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:44.140]   I mean, we've just accessed this here,
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.180]   the Paris tournament,
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.340]   and we're gonna have a look at Teddy Rene,
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:51.180]   but it's cheap at the price.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.860]   So we're now at Paris Grand Slam 2024,
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:55.420]   Teddy Rene final.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.260]   By the way, it's super cool.
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.660]   Like, you click on the draw,
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:03.180]   and you can just look at any of the matches.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.460]   You can go to the bottom of the finals.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.660]   You can go-
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.940]   - Yeah, to any one.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.420]   - Any one of them, that's so cool.
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:09.980]   That's really well done.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:11.260]   Really well done interface.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.940]   Anyway, let me at first ask the ridiculous big question.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.540]   Who do you think is the greatest of all time?
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.060]   Is Teddy Rene in the writing?
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.860]   - He's the greatest judo winner of all time.
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.340]   Of that, there's no doubt.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.980]   You know, I mean, he is.
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:26.260]   And I think if you asked him
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:30.260]   whether he was the greatest judo man
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.460]   in the world of all time,
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.300]   he would say, "No, I'm not."
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:37.140]   You know, and he's not the greatest judo man.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.980]   There are people with, you know,
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.020]   more beautiful judo in some ways,
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.300]   although he's got great technique,
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.060]   but he is the ultimate winner.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.180]   - 10-time world champ.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:50.020]   - Yeah.
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:52.740]   - 10-time gold medalist in the Olympics.
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.860]   I guess two-time bronze medalist.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.940]   He's probably going, is he's going to Paris?
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:57.780]   - Yeah.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:58.780]   - He's going after it again.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:10:59.620]   So he's right here.
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:00.460]   I mean-
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.300]   - He's right there.
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.820]   You know, this was just a couple of months ago.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:07.540]   And then last week he was out again and he won again.
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.300]   - You think he gets gold medal this time?
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.460]   - There's people getting closer to him, right?
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:15.020]   'Cause he's obviously, you know, he's age-wise
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.300]   and the amount of time that he's been there,
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:22.300]   he's obviously somebody that is starting
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:26.660]   not quite at his best as he was when he was younger.
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.620]   But he, like I say, he still puts it on the line.
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.660]   He lays it on the line every single time.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.740]   And then not only does he lay it on the line,
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.140]   but he beats them all, you know?
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.740]   And last week he just beat Saito,
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:41.140]   who's a young up-and-coming Japanese fighter.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.820]   And he beat him in the final.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.300]   It was close and he did well.
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:49.380]   There are certain people, the smaller ones actually,
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.300]   not the taller ones, 'cause like, you know,
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.300]   we're saying about the big arm over the top that he likes
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.020]   and the dominant grip that he likes.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.940]   There are people that can give him a hard time.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.180]   Now, if at the Olympic Games
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.740]   he has two or three of those on the trot,
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.300]   it might work against him, you know?
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:08.700]   And it's by no means an absolute certainty
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.540]   that he's gonna win the Olympic gold medal.
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:14.500]   But he's gotta be one of the favorites, top favorite.
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.860]   You know, no matter what happens now,
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:19.700]   Teddy Rene is the greatest winner that, you know,
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:22.380]   and if you asked the great Yamashita,
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.980]   he would say the same.
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.940]   You know, there's nobody that's...
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:27.300]   You know, and Yamashita was unbeaten
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.580]   in international competition.
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:33.580]   And I trained with Yamashita a lot over a two-year period
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.860]   and got to know him quite well.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:38.260]   And he was one of the greatest of all times.
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.380]   You know, for me, he was one of the greatest judo men.
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:44.460]   And I'm talking about from a technical point of view,
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:48.140]   from a spectacular judo point of view,
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:51.860]   understanding the fundamental principles
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:54.580]   of how techniques work.
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:55.900]   Sometimes having, you know,
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.900]   different techniques that work for you, you know?
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.540]   So if one doesn't work
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.980]   and one particular direction doesn't work,
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.740]   you can change the direction completely.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:05.580]   - In case people don't know,
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:09.300]   Yamashita is this legendary judoka, heavyweight.
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.780]   Teddy Rene, heavyweight, that's plus 100 kg.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.220]   So he- - He would've caused him
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:15.540]   all sorts of problems.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.980]   - Oh yeah, that's cool.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.420]   Who do you think wins, Yamashita versus Teddy Rene?
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.340]   - Yeah, so I think Yamashita, but you know-
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.180]   - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:24.020]   Do you think Yamashita beats Teddy Rene?
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:24.860]   - I think so.
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:27.260]   - Strong words.
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:28.540]   You think so.
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:29.460]   You think so.
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.060]   Yamashita is on the shorter side, right?
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:35.260]   - Yeah, and he finds it more difficult with shorter people,
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.100]   you know?
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:40.820]   And so it would've been a very interesting confrontation.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.860]   And I think if you asked Yamashita,
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:47.980]   he would probably say, you know,
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.340]   that Teddy Rene, he's very gracious.
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.380]   He's really gracious.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.540]   It would be really good.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:57.220]   It would've been an unbelievable matchup.
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:00.260]   And I've gotta say this, that, you know,
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:03.500]   Teddy Rene is the greatest winner of all time.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.740]   - Competition-wise.
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.220]   So it's interesting.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:09.380]   Both of them, maybe you can correct me,
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.060]   but have this Osorogare,
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:14.580]   which is kind of a trip that I never understood.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:15.500]   - Yeah.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.940]   - Like, it was a very tricky thing to do, right?
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.780]   It's very easy to do maybe as a white belt.
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:24.460]   You roll in, you can understand,
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.780]   but like to do it at the high, high, high level.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.140]   - You see any of the top guys now,
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:34.100]   especially if they're second time out, you know?
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.300]   So like, they might catch somebody by surprise.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.500]   They come out and they go, bang.
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.900]   And you go, that was amazing, right?
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:42.900]   But if they fought again, 10 minutes later,
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:46.060]   you go, you're not gonna catch me with that, right?
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.940]   You got a different situation here.
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:50.500]   And so it's slightly different,
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:54.940]   but the best fighters adapt like that.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:59.500]   And they're able to see a situation, feel the situation,
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.140]   and they attack once and then go again
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.380]   and attack second, third time.
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.260]   And in the third time, they make it work.
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:08.180]   - Yeah, both Yamashita and Teddy Rene
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.540]   with Sorogare, they'll just like hit it
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:11.700]   over and over in the match.
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:14.580]   - Yeah, sometimes it'll hit first time and it won't go.
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:16.900]   And then you make a readjustment of the way in.
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.100]   It's a little bit like, I mean,
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:21.180]   if you take a really easy way of understanding it,
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:23.740]   is if we're shooting at a target
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.740]   and all of a sudden you start moving that target,
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.860]   you know, it's different hitting a moving target,
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.380]   but it's also different hitting a moving target
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:35.700]   that's trying to hit you as well.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:36.980]   And that's our game, right?
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:40.580]   So we're not only trying to throw a moving target,
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.100]   we're trying to throw a moving target
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:43.780]   that's trying to throw us.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.460]   So that makes it even more difficult.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:50.420]   - Yeah, there's a few folks who you know what's coming.
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:53.580]   It's like over and over and over, it's the same attack.
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:58.580]   Anyway, with this Uchimada, it's like, it's different.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.300]   There's not many people like that,
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:01.900]   where it's like the same attack.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.380]   I mean, there's other attacks also,
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:04.740]   but they'll just go after the same thing
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:05.700]   over and over and over.
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:08.100]   - When I watch great athletes,
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:11.940]   most of them can throw over both flanks.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.100]   Not always going left and right, you know,
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:17.500]   although our sport always, I mean,
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:20.340]   the Katters are always demonstrated left and right.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.220]   So like, if you demonstrate,
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:25.820]   if you do something on one side, you know,
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:28.420]   then can you demonstrate it on the other side, right?
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:30.700]   Okay, so can you do it equally?
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.260]   No, but you do it differently, right, on the other side.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:36.300]   So, you know, when I'm teaching,
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.460]   I don't teach left and right.
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:42.340]   I teach, so if I was teaching you to do a technique,
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:43.580]   first thing I'd do is say,
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.460]   I need you to take the sleeve and lapel, all right?
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:49.980]   So I'd let you decide what was left and right, okay?
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:54.980]   'Cause often what happens is we impart on people,
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:56.820]   whether they're gonna be left or right
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.860]   when we start teaching.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.180]   You know, you get a lot of teachers do that, all right?
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.060]   And they'll say immediately,
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.060]   what do you write with, left or right hand?
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.900]   And it's no indicator actually as to how we do judo,
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:08.700]   'cause I'm left-handed
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:11.060]   and I do more predominantly right-handed
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.380]   because I lead off my strongest hand.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.420]   And actually most people do, you know,
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:20.020]   so actually left and right is a bit of a trap sometimes,
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:21.260]   you know, when we're teaching.
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:24.340]   Better to get, you know, because we can go,
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:29.340]   so my point was is that a lot of people can go both flanks.
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.180]   So they'll do something over this side
[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.620]   and something over this side.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:35.020]   - But in a way it was one-sided.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.580]   - He was one-sided, but he could switch it.
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:41.500]   So he had a Shinagi as well on the other side.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.500]   So he could switch it if he had to, yeah.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:48.060]   - And by the way, your opponent in '84,
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:50.020]   was he righty or lefty?
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:51.060]   - He was a righty.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:55.020]   - So that drop left, say, oh, where did that come from?
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.100]   - Well, I mean, again, it was, you know,
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:00.140]   he could have probably, in other contests,
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:02.100]   he'd hit me with it several times
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.580]   and I'd just stopped it, you know,
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.060]   and just at the wrong place at the right time for him.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:10.180]   Right place in the wrong time for me, right?
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.260]   - That's life, you know.
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:12.460]   - Yeah.
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:14.860]   - All right, let's watch from tight over there.
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:20.460]   - This is final of Paris tournament.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:23.660]   And this is against the Korean.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.260]   The Korean had had a great day, actually.
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:31.420]   - Again, shorter.
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:32.580]   - Again, shorter.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:33.820]   So he does find that difficult.
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:34.940]   Have a look at Teddy Renner.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:37.700]   Teddy Renner is trying to catch the sleeve.
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.300]   He's after the sleeve and then the right arm over the top.
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.500]   That's the key point for Teddy Renner.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:48.780]   And of course, what he has done,
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:52.660]   if he can't always catch the big Osada Gary
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:55.900]   over his right-hand side,
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:19:00.740]   he's been doing something to the opposite side.
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.660]   And the Korean just went for a drop sale.
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:09.420]   And Teddy Renner blocked with the hips.
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.060]   And he's, he's a big boy.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.980]   - Like I say, he has difficulty always against somebody
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.660]   smaller dropping with the sea and Aggies.
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:21.460]   - Has Teddy Renner ever been thrown for Ippon?
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.380]   Do you remember?
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:24.220]   - I've never seen him thrown for Ippon,
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:27.420]   but he was thrown last week for a nice technique
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.340]   and he's being caught more and more.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:30.300]   - So it's getting close.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.140]   - Yeah.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:34.860]   And Tseyev in the final of the world championships,
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:37.940]   they had a strange situation there where Tseyev
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:44.100]   was a technique down and then pulled off a counter
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:49.580]   and they didn't count it, but then they overruled it.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.140]   Unfortunately, I was commentating at the time
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:56.580]   and I went for a score for Tseyev.
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.620]   And anyway, they overruled it.
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:02.220]   And then they awarded a second gold medal to Tseyev.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.780]   - What can you say about Tamerlan Basaev
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:06.300]   who also gave him trouble?
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.700]   - Yeah, Basaev and Tseyev are the two
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.100]   that could possibly go to the Olympics.
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:14.940]   So that was a close one there from Renner.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.860]   That was closest that he'd actually been.
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.180]   - Oh, wow.
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.100]   - So didn't have the sleeve
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:23.140]   and he relies on the sleeve greatly.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:26.740]   Big support there in the French, in the crowd.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:31.020]   - And also maybe can you explain the penalties for stalling?
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.860]   - Yeah, so if they don't attack,
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:35.900]   if they've got a grip and they've got sleeve lapel
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:38.180]   or they got two hands on,
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:40.660]   if they're too passive and they don't attack,
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:43.660]   if they've got dominant sleeve grip, they don't attack.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:46.100]   That was quite close as well from the Koreans.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.420]   So the Korean here you can see is having a real go.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.180]   The penalties will come if they don't attack
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.340]   at the right time.
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:53.980]   Step outside the yellow area,
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:56.220]   they'll get penalized as well.
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.060]   That...
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.660]   - That's dedication for...
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:01.980]   - Absolutely, I mean, it was really close, wasn't it?
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:05.900]   They had a nice little coach, Gary, there from the Korean.
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:09.580]   And if they touch below the belt line with the arms,
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:12.940]   so if they can, they're not allowed to grab the legs.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.740]   They've stopped grabbing the legs.
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:17.700]   - Wow, the Koreans really going...
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.140]   - Koreans having a real good go at it.
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.300]   - I guess every single person in that division
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:24.700]   is probably training for Teddy Renner, right?
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:27.420]   - You think Teddy Renner's been there a long time.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.620]   He's got another guy here
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:30.460]   in the final of the Paris tournament.
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:33.380]   He's got 18,000 people watching him.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:35.580]   They're all on Teddy Renner's side.
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:36.940]   They want him to win.
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:39.660]   And the Korean's out there on his own with his coach.
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:41.980]   - But also the pressure on Teddy Renner.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.420]   - Amazing pressure.
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.780]   We interviewed him after this.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:49.060]   And he said, "I've got pressure."
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:52.260]   People go, "Well, is he gonna do it at the Olympic Games?
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:54.020]   "Can I do it in Paris?"
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.820]   He wanted to go to Paris.
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:56.940]   I mean, really, I mean,
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:00.220]   the last Olympic Games should have been it, shouldn't it?
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:01.940]   Should have been the final one.
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.580]   But he's gone, "No, I've got to do another four years."
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:07.220]   Two penalties are on the board already for the Korean.
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:10.940]   That Korean is really having a great go at Teddy Renner.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.620]   - A bit of a lift on him.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:14.300]   He's going after it. (laughs)
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:15.420]   - He's really going after it.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:19.140]   You know, it's an amazing effort there from the Korean.
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:23.260]   And he's getting some last minute information.
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:25.340]   I don't know if you've ever seen his coach
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:27.980]   stood next to him like that, but it's amazing.
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:31.780]   He's six foot six, and he's about four foot six.
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.860]   (laughs)
[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.220]   He's a real kid.
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:35.060]   - But full of passion.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:35.900]   I love it.
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:36.780]   He's like screaming.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.580]   - So a golden score.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.060]   - How does golden score work, can you say?
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:41.140]   - So a golden score.
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:43.380]   So if it goes without any point on the board
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:47.820]   from a throw or a hold down or arm lock strangle,
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:49.700]   then it goes into golden score.
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:52.220]   So two Shidos on the board apiece.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:55.340]   One more mistake now, and it's gonna be all over.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.180]   - Oh, wow.
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.020]   - And that's it.
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:23:00.780]   Teddy Renner just manages to turn it on the Korean.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:05.780]   And that went really against the run of play, didn't it?
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.300]   - Yeah.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:08.900]   - 'Cause the Korean did better, you know.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:10.860]   But you know, Teddy Renner is a winner.
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:11.700]   - Yeah.
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.780]   - And he says, right, okay, let's have more cheering.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:15.780]   (laughs)
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:17.940]   - Finds a way to score.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:20.980]   - And I have to say, you know, that even when he loses,
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.460]   you know, he's always graceful.
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.300]   - Yeah.
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.300]   - He doesn't like it, but he's graceful.
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.300]   - Yeah, there was so much love there, celebration.
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:28.140]   It was great.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:28.980]   It's great to see.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.660]   It's great that he's doing it again,
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:33.180]   going after it, chasing the gold medal again.
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.380]   - Well, he's chasing the gold medal.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:35.780]   It's gonna be in Paris,
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:39.100]   which is gonna be even, you know, more fantastic.
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:40.620]   You know, he's already the greatest.
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:43.100]   You said, you know, what has he gotta do to be the greatest?
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:47.100]   He's already the greatest competitor Judo's ever known.
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:52.100]   And that was even, you know, with the great Tally, you know?
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:56.100]   So Tally was amazing as well.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:58.180]   - Are you part of the commentating team for Paris?
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:23:59.780]   - I'm part of the commentating team,
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:03.060]   but it won't be for IJF because it's independent broadcast.
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:07.380]   - Have you ever had an athlete sort of come up to you
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:09.780]   and ask like, why'd you say that?
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:12.500]   Or like disagree with your commentary?
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:15.100]   - Do you know, I've gotta say that 99%,
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:19.180]   99.9% of everybody is so grateful
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:22.220]   that I've commentated their fights all the way through.
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.060]   They know if they've messed up.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:27.860]   So if I say something and I'm never disparaging,
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:30.820]   really disparaging, you know, but what I will say is,
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.500]   you know, it was a great throw by the other guy
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.020]   or it was a great match.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:38.340]   And if they made a mistake, so if they walk out,
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:41.220]   they know that I will say something
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:43.540]   that will, you know, mean something.
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:45.580]   So nobody really moans about it.
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:49.060]   I try and talk the truth, if I can.
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:53.820]   - So who else would you consider as some of the greats?
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.260]   So I personally just,
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:58.100]   'cause I love the standing Sanagi, Koga.
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.180]   So there's like, you know, the number of times
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:03.660]   you won the world championships and the Olympic games,
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:05.340]   but there's also like how you won
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:08.020]   and how you won into fights and what you did.
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.780]   You know, it's not necessarily about getting gold medals.
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:15.500]   It's about how you fought and how you represent the sport.
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:19.020]   And there's certain athletes like Inoue and Eliade
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.660]   that are going after the big throws.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.700]   - Only after they don't wanna win by Ippon, you know?
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:27.300]   And I think that that is the difference
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:28.900]   is they're the ones that come out there.
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:33.300]   And it's a bit like, you know, when Tyson stepped out there,
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:35.580]   you knew what you were gonna get, you know?
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:37.460]   And if they went toe to toe,
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:40.340]   if Tyson had somebody going toe to toe,
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.100]   somebody was gonna get knocked out.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.900]   And, you know, we got the same in judo
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:47.220]   when people go head to head and it's an open match.
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:49.380]   And I often talk about an open match.
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:51.980]   I say it's an open match.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.380]   They're both trying to score.
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:55.140]   Somebody is gonna get scored on.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.740]   Somebody's gonna go, you know?
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:58.460]   And that makes it exciting.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:00.620]   And it's when they come out and they close up,
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:02.420]   you know, then that's not an exciting match.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:06.780]   - Is there a case for Ohno, Shohei Ohno,
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.980]   three-time world champ, two-time gold medalist?
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:10.780]   - I think that, you know, judo-wise,
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:12.140]   he's gotta be one of the greatest
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:14.940]   because he had such versatility.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:20.260]   He had, he could go right and he could go left.
[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:22.940]   He could pick up, he could go to the ground as well.
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.420]   He won a lot of his earlier matches on the ground.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:30.820]   I think his empathy, you know,
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:35.020]   and how he presents himself sometimes, he falls down.
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:37.620]   And I think that hopefully that should come
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:40.540]   with tutoring and, you know,
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:43.740]   of how to be a great champion after, you know,
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.420]   it's not just about what you do on the mat,
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:47.140]   but what you do off the mat as well.
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:49.980]   - So to you, a great champion is the whole package
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:52.740]   of how you present yourself when you lose,
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.900]   how you represent yourself just off the mat.
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:57.860]   - Yeah, I think it's how you present yourself afterwards,
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.540]   how you are with people, how much you can help people.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:05.340]   I mean, people, kids, and, you know,
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:07.300]   they look up to these great champions
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:09.580]   because they want to be like them.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.780]   So the worst thing is when you get somebody
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.540]   that's a bit of an arse
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:17.060]   and they're not presenting themselves in the right way.
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:19.180]   So I like to see somebody presenting themselves
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.420]   in the right way.
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:23.140]   And I think that it's something that can be taught.
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:24.420]   It's something that normally comes
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:27.380]   with a little bit of experience, a little bit of age,
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:30.220]   you know, and I like to think that I'm a little bit
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.820]   different now than I was when I was 19.
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:35.300]   Not that it was bad, you know, I just think I was just,
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.580]   you know, I see it often now, you know,
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.980]   just full of beans.
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:43.340]   - You're a beautiful work in progress.
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:44.700]   What about Nomura?
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:50.060]   Did I hear Nomura as three-time gold medalist?
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.060]   - Never lost an Olympic fight.
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:54.060]   So there's nobody-- - There's something there,
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.460]   right? - Yeah.
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:57.220]   Nobody ever done that, you know what I mean?
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:00.060]   So that's gotta be, it has to stand,
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:04.260]   he took two years off in between every Olympic games
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:06.460]   and came back, did the right amount of events
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:10.300]   to qualify for, not only did he, having to qualify,
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:12.740]   he had to qualify through Japan.
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:16.340]   Now Japan, remember, have got the greatest depth.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:18.860]   So they got people coming through all the time,
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:22.300]   you know, and then he had to win the Japanese trials.
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:25.740]   I mean, we had a four-time world champion from Japan.
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:28.540]   This is when world championships was every other year,
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:32.140]   and this is Shozo Fuji,
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.300]   and he was the greatest middleweight of all time,
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:38.620]   and never got to participate in the Olympics
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:42.340]   because he lost the Japanese trials twice
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:45.860]   in two Olympic, you know, possibilities.
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:50.860]   So, you know, he had to qualify for Japan
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:52.980]   and then go to the Olympic games and then do it there,
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:55.900]   you know, so sometimes some of the best people in Japan
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.460]   can't get outside of Japan.
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:00.300]   Look at the situation they had with Abe
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:03.220]   and then they had Maruyama.
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:08.220]   Maruyama was, you know, and Abe were both the best by far
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:12.340]   in the under 66 kilos category.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:14.740]   This is for the last Olympic games,
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:17.300]   and they sent one to the world championships,
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.420]   one to the Olympic games,
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:20.820]   and they both won gold medals, you know.
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:22.540]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's why
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:25.660]   the All Japan Championships is, like, legendary.
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:28.180]   There's these battles, yeah,
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.780]   with Yamashita and all of them.
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.820]   - Well, Abe and Maruyama,
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:36.780]   they had a trials in the Kodokan.
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:42.460]   It was 26 minutes, I think it was 26 minutes it went.
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.980]   They were battling it out for 26 minutes.
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:45.900]   - That's great.
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:49.260]   If we can just go to, you've trained in Japan,
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.500]   what are those randoris like?
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:52.940]   What's that training like?
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:57.460]   - I touched on the danger.
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:00.500]   That danger of being thrown when you get hold of somebody
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.340]   or somebody gets hold of you.
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:05.260]   And I often reflect, I often talk about it
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:06.500]   when I'm commentating, you know,
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.780]   'cause I can see immediately.
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:09.620]   You know, it's easy, isn't it?
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:11.180]   You know, if we're in the commentary chair,
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:12.980]   or if you're in the coach's chair,
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:15.420]   and you don't really understand totally,
[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.500]   absolutely what's going on when you're being,
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.740]   somebody's being outgripped,
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:21.860]   and when they're in danger of being thrown.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:24.260]   I mean, you know, if you're in danger of being thrown,
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:27.100]   the first thing you do is stick your backside out
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:28.820]   and defend by, you know,
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:32.300]   by not being in the position they want you to be in.
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:34.540]   All right, and so that's danger.
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:36.980]   You know, you feel the danger.
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:41.700]   And so in Japan, that was the place I used to go to train
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:43.700]   because I felt the danger,
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:48.700]   and so my defenses would be heightened.
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:51.580]   And so somebody that was,
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:54.780]   I went two years, one Olympic cycle,
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:57.940]   I went two years, two months
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:02.940]   without having a score on me in any competition.
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.820]   And then I went to one competition
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:08.620]   in the European championships, which I won,
[01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:12.300]   and I was struggling all the way through it,
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:17.300]   and got scored on three times in my pool of,
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.220]   you know, like my first pool of fights,
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.260]   and I was devastated.
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:23.500]   And I actually nearly lost the whole competition
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:27.140]   because I was more mortified about being scored on
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:29.420]   three times when I hadn't been scored on
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:30.260]   for two and a half years.
[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:32.620]   I had this thing in my head about two and a half years,
[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:36.060]   I've, you know, and then all of a sudden, right,
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:37.140]   I'm not unbeatable.
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:39.660]   And then you just, and you go,
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:43.060]   and I was almost lost it, completely lost it.
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:44.740]   Just so fortunate.
[01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:47.820]   Couple of things went my way and just came out,
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:51.020]   and I scraped and scratched my way to the final
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:53.700]   and won the final well, all right?
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:56.940]   But that was my best match, but I almost lost it.
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:59.020]   - Well, what do you do with the fact that if you go to Japan
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.940]   and you're getting, you're saying danger,
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.260]   like you're probably getting--
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:03.100]   - Getting thrown.
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:04.460]   - Getting thrown in Japan. - Yeah.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:06.060]   - What does that do to your ego?
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:07.700]   - Well, again, it's my, you know,
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.540]   that was a winning ego that had to adapt.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:13.380]   I remember we went to the Keisyo,
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:15.500]   which police dojo one time,
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:18.220]   and they wanted to see the,
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:22.140]   they created this groundwork competition
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:26.660]   because they wanted to see me do the juji,
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:30.180]   like how I went in and how I, yeah, the armbar, right?
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:31.820]   They wanted to see how I did it
[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:33.500]   from underneath or over the top.
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.900]   And you'd just, they created this event.
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:36.740]   - Study the creature.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.820]   - Yeah, they started it.
[01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:41.100]   So, and then winner stays on competition
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.780]   was happening at the Keisyo.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:45.580]   So I did about seven, I think, seven in.
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:49.260]   And then my coach came in and said, "No, it's finished.
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:50.380]   That's it now, it's finished."
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:52.740]   You know, suddenly we realized what was going on.
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:56.900]   And I was going, "No, no, no, no, don't stop it like that."
[01:32:56.900 --> 01:33:01.900]   You know, and it was one of those moments
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:06.020]   where, you know, the boot was on my foot,
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:06.940]   you could say, you know,
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:09.340]   rather than the other side, the other way.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:12.380]   'Cause I had been to Japan in situation.
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:17.380]   I remember as a 16 year old, I got such a drumming
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:24.780]   from one of the Japanese guys, older students,
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:26.380]   and he had a gold tooth.
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:29.540]   And so he was gold tooth to me, you know,
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:31.620]   and he was my nightmare.
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:35.140]   And I remember kept coming out to fight him
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:37.940]   because he kept throwing me and I was crying
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:40.100]   and I was upset and I was like,
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:44.180]   and then that was another occasion where I got dragged away
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.820]   and I said, "No."
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.740]   So I wanted to go back and fight him.
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:52.220]   And I went back to the same dojo every year to fight him.
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.980]   He was on my mind.
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:57.100]   Morning, noon, night, he was on my mind.
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:57.940]   - Gold tooth was on your mind.
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.900]   - Gold tooth was on my mind, you know.
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.620]   And-- - You ever get him?
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:05.100]   - Two years later, I was, two years to me
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:07.500]   from 16 to 18 was totally different.
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:11.020]   18 years of age, I was pretty competitive with him.
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:15.220]   And it was like, you know, I was standing up with him.
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.740]   19, he was in the groundwork competition.
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:22.060]   - And that's when the switch happened.
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.660]   - Switch happened, you know, because I just,
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:28.020]   well, because I remember getting the arm lock
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:31.700]   and he didn't put it on immediately.
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:34.100]   I needed it to last, it had to last.
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:35.500]   - Sure, it had to last.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.780]   - I spread it, the whole thing lasted
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.980]   as long as I could possibly get it.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:44.060]   And it was a long memory as I was looking down at him.
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:47.380]   - And now he has nightmares about you.
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:48.220]   - Now he has nightmares.
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:49.580]   - I wonder what nickname he has for you.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:53.260]   - I don't know, I'm hoping that he remembers me as--
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:54.100]   - He has a photo of you.
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:56.420]   - You know what, he probably doesn't say,
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:59.460]   just back of an eyelid, doesn't say a thing about it.
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:02.580]   - Well, I mean, can you just speak
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:06.260]   to that training with those folks, you know,
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:11.060]   you said crying, just the frustration of being thrown.
[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:11.900]   - Yeah.
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:14.300]   - I mean, how do you, it's such a beautiful part
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:16.780]   of the process of becoming great.
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:20.420]   - Yeah, I think it is just something that you're,
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:22.980]   you know, that doesn't happen at this level.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:25.100]   You know, we were talking about levels
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.380]   and then at this level, it never happened.
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.460]   And then I went out in my first European cadet
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:36.060]   and all of a sudden I wasn't this top guy,
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:37.540]   I was in the mix.
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:39.940]   And then I had to work myself to the top of that mix
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:42.780]   and then to the top of the next one, you know,
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.500]   'cause I went to the European Senior Championships
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.460]   and, you know, again, you're not the top
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:50.460]   and, you know, you work your way to the top of that.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:52.300]   And I think it is a frustration, you know,
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:56.140]   but I think it's that kind of hatred of losing
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:36:01.140]   and also being able to, you know,
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:02.540]   being out of control.
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:04.020]   I think that the first time,
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:06.620]   first Senior European Championships I fought,
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:09.780]   I fought Nevzorov, but he was only one of my contests.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.980]   Then I had to fight a Frenchman for third place,
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:16.020]   but he totally outgripped me.
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:19.020]   And I remember I was more upset,
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:20.780]   though I won the contest,
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:24.220]   I was more upset that he totally out,
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:27.020]   he did outgrip me and I was more upset.
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:30.420]   And then I fought him a year later and outgripped him.
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:33.300]   All right, so it was one of those, you know,
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:35.740]   it was a learning process all the way through.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:40.180]   - Yeah, that like frustration is like,
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:43.460]   whatever that does to your soul,
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:45.420]   the building up afterwards
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:48.260]   is what actually makes you better.
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:49.100]   It's fascinating.
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:52.580]   And you think there's in Japan, just killers there,
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.740]   they're like, just the world doesn't know about,
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:55.940]   they just-
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.340]   - Yeah, there's world champions in the dojo.
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:00.660]   You know, there's people that never make it out.
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.460]   You know, I remember we were training like so,
[01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:07.260]   and everybody that goes to Japan,
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:12.260]   all my friends that have been world Olympic champions,
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:14.140]   right, they all know what I'm talking about.
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:17.060]   They know exactly what I'm saying,
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:19.100]   is that when we go to the dojos there,
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:22.020]   we all get thrown by people that never come out
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:23.140]   to be world champions.
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:24.860]   You know, they're just in the mix
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:26.900]   or they're going through three years of university
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:28.820]   and then they go, we had a guy,
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:34.460]   we had a guy that came in, he came, he was a business guy.
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:37.180]   He came in with his suitcase and his briefcase like that,
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:39.460]   he's got his tie up like that.
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:44.220]   So he decides he's gonna come in and he gets changed
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:47.500]   and he's in his lunch hour.
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.620]   He's in his lunch hour, right?
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:49.860]   So gotta be quick.
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:51.220]   - Yeah.
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:53.020]   - So he comes in and he goes through,
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:56.180]   he's working his way through the whole of the British team.
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:57.620]   We're all lined up, right?
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:59.300]   He's just working his way through the whole
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:01.540]   of the British team and I knew it was my turn next.
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:05.820]   So I get hold of him and I throw him immediately.
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:08.340]   And then it was what we were talking about
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:13.340]   when it happens in the first few seconds of the practice.
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:17.140]   So then I had four minutes of him coming at me
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.940]   and I'm going up into the air and I'm twisting off
[01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:21.380]   and I'm like that.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:24.180]   And then like everybody's laughing at the side of the mat
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.140]   or the whole British team,
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:26.460]   he's gone through the whole British team
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:29.220]   and then he, 10 minutes later,
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:31.860]   he's just tying his tie up like that,
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:34.300]   you know, and back to work like that.
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:36.220]   You know, imagine him sitting behind his desk
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:37.860]   in his computer.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.980]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.420]   - I'm glad he didn't get out.
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:43.660]   (laughing)
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:46.340]   - Hopefully he listens to this.
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:47.980]   - Hopefully.
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:50.180]   - Anybody else I didn't mention as part of the greats
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:52.140]   that just kind of jumped in?
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:57.140]   - Kashiwazaki Sensei is my favorite of all favorites.
[01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:03.460]   He is what I would call a judo genius.
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:05.020]   I don't know if you can get him up here.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:05.860]   Can we get him up?
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:06.700]   - Yeah.
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:09.700]   - So going to 1981 World Championships
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:15.220]   and I'll talk you through the great Kashiwazaki.
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:18.700]   He was one year in Great Britain
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:24.740]   and he was a guy that was so much a genius.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:27.460]   All right, so you want the final of the under 60,
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:30.540]   65 kilograms, there, the one at the top.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:31.380]   This is him.
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:34.660]   He is two weight categories below my weight category
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:36.500]   that I won the World Championships.
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:37.940]   Same year, I won it.
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:41.700]   So this is, it's not,
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:45.140]   I'm not sure if this is going to show his final of.
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:45.980]   - This is the highlight.
[01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:47.340]   - I know, so watch this.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:51.900]   This he did in the final of the world, right?
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:52.740]   - For people just listening,
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:55.820]   he did an incredible sacrifice throw.
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:58.900]   - Yep, and then he was on top for the Naoise
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:01.300]   and renowned for his groundwork
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:06.300]   and he was on top against a really strong Romanian guy.
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:11.700]   All right, so his transition was just phenomenal.
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:13.660]   - Yeah, let me go back and look at that,
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:14.620]   what just happened.
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:16.100]   - So he's just showing you.
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:20.900]   So he does this coachy thing just to create space.
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:24.980]   And it's his follow through into groundwork
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:28.380]   that is best of all.
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:31.460]   And then the Romanian, really strong, like I say,
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:33.020]   he'd gone all the way through to the final
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:33.900]   of the World Championships,
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:37.420]   winning most by Ipon, I think, the Romanian.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:40.540]   And he's defending really, really well here.
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:43.860]   And you can see that how persistent.
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:45.580]   He knows exactly what he wants.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:47.220]   He's just got to get his leg out.
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:49.140]   Now watch, he'll tie the arm up
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:51.980]   and then he'll pull the top leg towards him.
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:54.260]   And then he'll push the bottom one off.
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:57.020]   - Always working.
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:59.780]   - With both feet, always working, always working.
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:04.860]   Readjust the balance, still one leg trapped.
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:06.100]   Final of the World Championships,
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:08.860]   good referee because he's refereeing something here
[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:11.980]   that's happening, that's going to decide as to whether.
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:14.780]   So he doesn't call it to stand it up at all.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:16.340]   Watch him pull the top one now
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:18.260]   and he'll push the bottom one.
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:21.420]   - There's a calmness on his face.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.820]   - Calm. - Which is great to see.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:27.820]   - Calm, pushes the bottom leg, leg out, job done.
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:30.100]   All finished.
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:30.940]   This is him again.
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:33.780]   Watch this, this is another technique that he does.
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:37.180]   And then just, again, sacrifice directly in,
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:38.780]   directly into the Newaza.
[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:42.580]   - Transition is everything, isn't it?
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:43.420]   - In judo.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.260]   - Yeah.
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:45.660]   - Well, in anything really,
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:47.660]   but judo especially pays off.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:52.540]   - Yeah, I mean, because we haven't got that long.
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:53.980]   I mean, we had more time here.
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:55.620]   They've just brought more time back.
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:58.220]   So we've got more time to transition in
[01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:00.940]   and to get the situation that we want
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:04.380]   and to get the attacking situation that we want.
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:08.900]   Because, you know, I remember I was teaching in America
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:11.820]   to some jiu-jitsu guys and they were saying,
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:13.620]   "Oh, we'll never give you our back."
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:18.300]   And I said, "With judo rules, certain situations,
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:22.700]   "it happens that, you know, when we try and do throws
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:25.380]   "where we're facing away from our opponent,
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:28.180]   "you know, so like, for example, Cienagis,
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:31.580]   "if they fail, then the back is there, you know,
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:33.060]   "and that's how we get the back.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.900]   "And it's a different situation, you know,
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.700]   "than going on your back in the guard situation,
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:38.540]   "totally different."
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:40.100]   - Well, there are Travis Stevens,
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:42.620]   I don't know how familiar with his judo,
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.420]   but he's a really interesting example
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:47.340]   'cause he competed at the highest level in jiu-jitsu as well.
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:51.980]   And his idea, he's a big Cienagis guy.
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:55.820]   And he basically threw all of that away.
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:56.900]   - In the jiu-jitsu?
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:57.820]   - In the jiu-jitsu.
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:02.300]   Like he took the sport from scratch for what it is.
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:05.340]   So he almost never did a standing Cienagis,
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:07.620]   Cienagis at all in jiu-jitsu.
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:09.700]   - No, because it would leave his back all the time,
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.340]   you know, if it failed.
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:12.620]   - Yeah, if it failed.
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:14.820]   - But he wouldn't have the same kind of grip
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:18.300]   on the judogi or the karate, the jiu-jitsu gi.
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:19.140]   - Yeah.
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:20.300]   - A little bit different.
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:22.060]   - And so you have to kind of consider the sport,
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:24.020]   the art of it, and also the competitors,
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:26.660]   the styles and the culture of the sport,
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:27.820]   if you want to win.
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:29.340]   If winning is the most important thing,
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:31.700]   then you're like, "All right, well, let's, you know."
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.620]   - No, but you learn the game, don't you?
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:36.060]   And that's what he did, he learned the game.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:38.540]   You know, and I think that is credit to him,
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:40.820]   you know, and that's why I was saying about wrestling,
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:41.780]   you know, the wrestlers.
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:45.700]   I mean, good to learn the judo,
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:49.060]   and for what it is and the mechanics and how it works,
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:51.060]   and then learn the wrestling.
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:53.540]   I mean, I do the commentary as well for the freestyle,
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:55.260]   and I will be at the Olympics
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:57.580]   for the freestyle and the Greco-Roman.
[01:43:57.580 --> 01:44:00.940]   So, and I love the freestyle, absolutely love it.
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:03.420]   But freestyle is freestyle, judo is judo.
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:05.340]   I like to see people doing judo.
[01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:10.340]   - Yeah, but there's a rhyme to the whole combat thing.
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:13.500]   They're all, I mean, the body mechanics,
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:16.460]   it's all like fascinating echoes of each other
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:17.540]   in interesting ways.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:19.900]   The details are different,
[01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:24.580]   but there's still two humans clashing.
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:27.460]   - Yeah, we've got some amazing crossovers
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:31.380]   with people like the Mongolians have come in,
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:34.820]   the Georgians, I mean, the Georgians do massive pickups
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:37.340]   and different techniques.
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:42.340]   And if you ask the fighters where they're grabbing the legs,
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:47.220]   a lot of them would say, some of the wrestling styles,
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:51.020]   the Georgians and the Mongolians might say,
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:53.580]   "Yeah, I'd like to be able to take the legs."
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:55.900]   But a lot of them just adapted.
[01:44:55.900 --> 01:45:00.260]   You get Iliadis, for example, he just adapted.
[01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:02.220]   So he thought, "I'll take my arm over the top
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:03.900]   "and I'll just rip them out the floor that way."
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:05.300]   You know what I mean?
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:07.020]   - They're still doing the big lifts,
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:08.900]   they're still doing the big gripping,
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:12.620]   but they just don't grab below the legs.
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.940]   It's weird, they figured it out.
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:16.500]   - And they figured it out like that.
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:18.700]   - Yeah, you would think it'd take a long time.
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:21.300]   No, it was like a month.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.060]   - Yeah, no, exactly.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:25.860]   - The highest level, which is crazy.
[01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:27.340]   So you mentioned jiu-jitsu a little bit.
[01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:29.700]   What to you is an interesting difference
[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:32.940]   between jiu-jitsu and judo that you've observed?
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:36.220]   Because you're one of the greatest ever
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:38.380]   on the ground in judo.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:44.380]   And so jiu-jitsu is primarily focused
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:47.540]   on similar type of stuff on the ground.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:49.500]   So what to you is an interesting difference there?
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:50.780]   - They're a different approach,
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:53.620]   different time scale to them,
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:55.500]   and they have a different way in.
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:46:00.140]   So ours comes from a standing position directly in.
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:02.140]   We've got a time scale on it.
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:04.940]   So we have to, like the catch,
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:07.420]   what I always talk about the catch,
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:09.220]   because in judo terms,
[01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:12.220]   if you don't get the catch immediately,
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:16.420]   then the referee won't see the transition in
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:21.420]   and also the continuation from plan A, B, C, D,
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:23.700]   if something builds.
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:25.660]   So we have to build it.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:28.060]   And we have to build it quickly.
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:30.060]   And I think in jiu-jitsu terms,
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:32.540]   you have more time to build.
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:34.460]   - Yeah, there's a kind of patience,
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:36.060]   like, "Oh, if this doesn't work out,
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:37.660]   I can try a different thing."
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:39.260]   With judo, there's like an urgency.
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:40.300]   - There's an urgency.
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:44.220]   - And there's a ref watching skeptically.
[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:47.260]   So you better show that you're making progress.
[01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:48.740]   - You've got to show the progression.
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:51.740]   And that's why I always had a plan A, B, C.
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:55.980]   You see there with, that was 1981 there,
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:00.740]   the great Kashiwazaki had a progression.
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:03.420]   Everything was, he knew exactly where he had to be.
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:08.420]   It was feel, that wasn't by accident, it was trained.
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:11.100]   And I think that that transition there
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:14.540]   and taking control of somebody's mistakes.
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:18.540]   So somebody might have made a mistake or not hit properly,
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:21.140]   or your defense has caused them to make a mistake,
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:22.860]   and then you take advantage of it.
[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:24.940]   And that is the difference.
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:27.260]   - So one of the side effects of that,
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:29.140]   I don't know what the chicken or the egg,
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:34.100]   but judo people on the ground are much more aggressive.
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:36.380]   So probably because of the urgency,
[01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:38.540]   but just like there's an intention
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:40.980]   behind the progress you're making.
[01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:45.580]   I think jujitsu is more relaxed.
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:50.100]   There's more a culture of just finding places to relax
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:52.300]   and think of different control and positions
[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:53.300]   and take your time.
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:56.100]   And as a result, it's much, much less exhausting.
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.860]   So you can go for much longer.
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:02.100]   It feels like judo is exhausting.
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:03.700]   - It's that 10 second blast, isn't it?
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:07.780]   You know, it's like doing sprints all the time.
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:09.820]   You know, and that is really hard.
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:12.140]   And that's a special kind of condition you need.
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:13.980]   And you need to be able to catch it
[01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:17.140]   and know when to go and when not to go.
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:20.420]   And I think also, I was gonna ask you,
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:21.660]   you think it'd make a difference?
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:24.140]   I mean, certain jiu-jitsu,
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:27.340]   you can't just throw yourself on your back,
[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:28.380]   you know, into the guard.
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:32.060]   You have to throw into the situation, you know?
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:35.060]   So you have got, I mean, I know Roger Gracie,
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:38.500]   he decided that he was gonna learn judo.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.260]   He saw the importance of being able to throw
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:43.580]   for the transition in.
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:45.340]   And so he came to the Budokai
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:47.060]   and he was learning off Ray Stephens.
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:49.460]   And, you know, they were doing really a lot.
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:51.260]   - Yeah, well, he's a fascinating study
[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:54.500]   because he does the most basic stuff.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:56.020]   And he does it-- - But does it well.
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:58.700]   - Like we did, like another level of well.
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:48:59.940]   It's like Yamashita.
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:03.380]   Everyone knows what's coming with Roger Gracie.
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:05.260]   But he just does it anyway.
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:07.700]   I guess the best people in the world, it's crazy.
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:10.780]   He's like, everybody in jiu-jitsu at White Belt
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:13.060]   learns the techniques he's using.
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:15.780]   And he just does it. - Amazing, isn't it?
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:17.660]   But he has about 1,000 ways in?
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:18.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:22.180]   And in the 1,000 ways, there's in the details.
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:24.340]   So it kind of might even look the same to people,
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:27.580]   but there's, I mean, he finds a way to choke people.
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:29.460]   So he's on top of them mounted
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.420]   in a sort of judo pin position.
[01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:34.900]   And, you know, everyone knows what's coming next
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:36.740]   against the best people in the world.
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:40.220]   And you should be able to defend it, but nobody can.
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:41.060]   It's crazy.
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:43.260]   - I think there's the power element as well.
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:45.940]   You know, that you don't realize how, you know,
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:49.980]   when somebody is directed in a particular way,
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:53.660]   then you have that kind of element of absolute power.
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:57.060]   You can only feel like when Roger's doing a technique.
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:50:01.580]   I think that you would only feel it if he did it on you,
[01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:03.380]   you know, then you can feel it.
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:05.980]   It's not something that happens, you know,
[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:08.660]   like so tricks is one thing,
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:11.980]   but actually being able to do something really well
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:13.700]   from a power point of view, you know,
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:17.780]   it's like you say, he only does those few things,
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:20.140]   but he does them really, really, really well.
[01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:21.460]   - Yeah, I don't know what that is about.
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:25.060]   Actually, judo pins is a very interesting case study as well
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:28.940]   because people are able to feel so heavy.
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:30.660]   One of the things judoka are able to do
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:33.220]   is pin extremely well.
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:34.060]   - Yeah.
[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:36.260]   - And it makes you realize that it's not about the weight.
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:39.020]   It's about some kind of technique
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:43.140]   that makes people feel like they weigh 1,000 pounds.
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:47.420]   It's about weight distribution and change of balance.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:49.660]   You know, a lot of people don't realize
[01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:54.620]   that there's huge changes of balance on the ground.
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:56.740]   Massive, you know, you know what it's like.
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.460]   I mean, you know, you're a jujitsu man
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:02.500]   and, you know, the detail of the techniques
[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:04.020]   is what really interests me.
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:06.780]   You know, I mean, I'm always looking small ideas,
[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:08.900]   you know, I'm always looking at the jujitsu
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:11.100]   and I just, it fascinates me.
[01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:13.940]   You know, I would have done jujitsu for sure,
[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:18.700]   but I wouldn't have forgotten the judo way in
[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:19.540]   to the techniques.
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:20.380]   You know what I mean?
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:23.700]   I think that you've got to differentiate the two,
[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:26.820]   but I would have loved the jujitsu.
[01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:28.740]   I would have absolutely loved it, you know,
[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:30.980]   but it wasn't as prominent then, you know.
[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:33.820]   Where the newasa came from,
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:36.340]   it came from a mistake,
[01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:38.740]   me getting beaten in a particular contest.
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:41.980]   And I went, I'm not going to be beaten again on the ground.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:42.820]   (laughing)
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:44.340]   That's how it happened.
[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:45.300]   - Yeah, well, yeah.
[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:48.420]   The story of your life is like a loss creates,
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:50.820]   the Phoenix rises.
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:55.820]   - Well, it was 1978 and it was, you know,
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:57.060]   it wasn't a mistake.
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:59.300]   It was a particular movement
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:03.740]   and I was fighting weight up from my normal weight,
[01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:08.740]   but I stayed in the same position for one second too long,
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:10.260]   got caught and-
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:11.100]   - Choked?
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:12.980]   - Sengaku, yeah, triangle.
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:13.820]   Triangle, triangle.
[01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:14.780]   - Triangle, wow.
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:18.100]   - And I said, I literally,
[01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:20.340]   just the same as I said to you when I said,
[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:22.660]   I'm not going to drink anymore.
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:23.860]   I came off and I said,
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:25.820]   I'm never going to get caught on the ground.
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:27.340]   - Yeah, never going to lose on the ground ever again.
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:31.860]   - And I never lost in my whole competitive career again.
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:34.900]   - Oh, wow, but yeah, I shouldn't mention
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:38.420]   that there's nothing like a pin from a judo person.
[01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:41.060]   I don't actually know if people in jiu-jitsu
[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:44.900]   have made sense of that, like loaded that in.
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:48.340]   - But it's not part of the game, is it?
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:50.780]   You know, the pin, it's submission.
[01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:55.380]   - Yeah, but, you know, control is part of the game
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:58.260]   and nobody controls a human body
[01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:01.100]   the way judo people do on the ground.
[01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:03.820]   Like, they have understood the science of control
[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:06.460]   and I think that control is extremely useful
[01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:09.020]   in jiu-jitsu as well.
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.220]   It's just that people don't,
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:13.420]   'cause there's so many other domains of exploration,
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:14.700]   but the-- - That's interesting.
[01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:17.820]   - I mean, just, especially when you apply jiu-jitsu
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:22.020]   to the fighting setting, so mixed martial arts,
[01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:24.900]   that control, that side control, that pin control
[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:26.700]   is really, really, really important.
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:29.460]   But then you add punching to the thing
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:31.580]   and it becomes-- - That puts a whole different
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:32.540]   thing on it, doesn't it?
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:33.820]   - I mean, there's an alternate history
[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:36.700]   where you would have been part of the early UFCs
[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:38.780]   if time was a little different, you know?
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:42.380]   Maybe a few years later.
[01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:48.020]   'Cause your style of judo and jiu-jitsu
[01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:50.940]   and the transitions and the aggression,
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:52.500]   all of that would have worked really well
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:53.580]   in the early UFCs.
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:55.780]   - I'm sure I was being set up at one stage
[01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:57.180]   by one of the graces.
[01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:02.420]   And that was when he was winning all the matches.
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:05.580]   But he came, him with a couple of the cousins
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.420]   to one of my seminars. - Nice.
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:11.500]   - Yeah, and he was one of the first ones, wasn't he,
[01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:16.500]   that, that's how I loved to see the kind of UFC
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:20.380]   because it was different martial arts, different skills.
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:22.780]   And, you know, I mean, he'd get close
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:25.300]   and he'd just choke 'em out or arm lock them
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:27.460]   or, you know, arm bar them.
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:29.260]   And that was, that was brilliant.
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:31.740]   You know, that was, for me, that was a revelation.
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:33.380]   That was how I saw it.
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:34.220]   - Yeah. - And--
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:35.700]   - It's a fascinating science experiment,
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:38.100]   which aspects of different martial arts work well
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:40.260]   and not when they clash together.
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:44.060]   And it did turn out that Newaza worked well.
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:45.100]   - Was the key, yeah.
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:46.220]   It was the key, wasn't it, yeah.
[01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:48.460]   - Yeah, it was a big missing link
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:50.660]   in our conception of fighting.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:53.500]   It's the neutralizer of size
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:54.980]   and a lot of other components.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:56.780]   And it just blew people's mind.
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:59.300]   Like, okay, it's not just about size.
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:04.300]   It's not just about big, big guys swinging hands.
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:06.740]   It's a lot of other components.
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.180]   And the groundwork is really, really important.
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:12.060]   And of course, there's a fujidoka
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:15.200]   that succeeded in the UFC since then,
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:17.380]   which is always interesting how they adapt without,
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:18.700]   you know, when you take off the gi,
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:20.700]   how can you still throw people?
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:22.140]   How can you still do control?
[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:23.740]   How can you still take advantage
[01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:25.700]   of the transition on the ground?
[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:27.540]   Ronda Rousey's a good example of somebody
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.220]   that took advantage of that.
[01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:30.300]   - Yeah.
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:33.460]   I think one of the biggest things for the judoka
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:38.020]   is we've never, you know, there's no strikes.
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:43.020]   And I think that's the biggest shock, if you wish.
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:46.100]   You know, when you get one--
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:46.940]   - Punched in the face.
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:48.100]   - Yeah, punched in the face.
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:50.540]   And you're not used to that.
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:52.400]   You know, that's not what we're used to.
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:54.100]   - Some people are able to get punched in the face
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:55.540]   better than others, yeah.
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:57.100]   - For sure.
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:58.380]   Then again, there's Ronda Rousey
[01:55:58.380 --> 01:55:59.740]   who doesn't need to get punched in the face.
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:02.300]   She just gets in close, throws a person,
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:03.140]   armbar right there.
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:04.540]   - Yeah, and Kayla.
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:06.260]   You know, Kayla's one of them as well.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:08.620]   - Kayla Harrison, that's another incredible person.
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:11.580]   She could've probably been just winning Olympic gold medal
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:13.900]   after Olympic gold medal, but chose to--
[01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:15.720]   - Whatever, you know, she decides.
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:17.220]   I mean, Ronda as well, you know,
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:20.300]   whatever they decided to do, they're great athletes.
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:21.820]   Yeah, they hate losing.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:24.120]   I don't know anybody that hates losing
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:24.980]   more than those two.
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:25.820]   - Yeah.
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:27.500]   - They don't like it.
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:29.300]   - And Kayla Harrison, like, I don't know anybody
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:30.580]   that works as hard as her.
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:33.540]   That's a crazy, crazy, crazy work ethic.
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:35.180]   Well, let me ask you about training.
[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:39.200]   Again, Jimmy Pedro said he learned a lot from you.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:45.140]   He learned how to do a tai toshi and the armbar jiu-jitsu.
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:47.840]   But he also learned from you training methodology.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:50.900]   So what's he talking about?
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:52.060]   He told me about this.
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:55.940]   What's your approach to training throughout your career
[01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:57.420]   and as it developed?
[01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:00.780]   - I always wanted to train harder than anybody else.
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:02.460]   I still train now every day.
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:05.100]   If I don't train, do something.
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:07.900]   I do an hour of my physical work
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:09.420]   and I still go on the mat a little bit.
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:11.060]   You know, I'm 65 now.
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:15.020]   So I'm not doing really heavy stuff on the mat.
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:16.540]   But I still like to train.
[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:19.880]   And when I was 21, 20, up to 30,
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:22.040]   I was one of the best trainers.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:23.900]   But, you know, Jimmy Pedro
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:25.720]   was one of the best trainers as well.
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:29.500]   He was one of the, he's one of your dream athletes.
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:32.580]   You know, when Jimmy Pedro stepped through your door
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:33.620]   and he was just a kid.
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:35.340]   You know, he was like, he was just young
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:37.820]   when he stepped through my door.
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:39.780]   And I had a lot of full-time trainers.
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:42.900]   So I had up to 20 really good athletes
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:44.240]   that were training hard.
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:46.340]   And I only wanted hard trainers.
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:49.040]   Give me 10 that trained hard
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:51.320]   rather than your one prima donna that, you know,
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:55.580]   you're skillful, the one that, you know, could do it.
[01:57:55.580 --> 01:58:00.580]   I just, I wanted 10, you know, or 20 really hard trainers
[01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:03.640]   because you can do so much with them.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:05.260]   You can make champions.
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:07.400]   You can make them world champions.
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:10.160]   You know, if you've got somebody that was a special talent
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:12.520]   and they wanted to work hard,
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:14.000]   then you had a special athlete.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.880]   - When you say hard trainers, what do you mean?
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:18.340]   Are these people that just, like,
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:20.620]   every single day are able to just grind it out,
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:22.020]   do it around the door, do the training,
[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:24.380]   do the boring things, just keep coming back?
[01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:25.940]   - Yeah, when the going gets tough, you know,
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:28.300]   and I think that was him.
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:30.700]   He had a special mentality and, you know,
[01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:31.760]   and the thing is, you see,
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:34.340]   when you've got him in your dojo, all right,
[01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:36.860]   even when you're tired, when somebody's tired and when,
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:39.180]   you know, what an example to the others.
[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:42.100]   So he'd pull the other ones in as well, you know?
[01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:47.160]   So I had somebody that when everybody was tired
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:50.600]   and everybody was sick of it and everybody just wanted,
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:52.360]   you know, and he'd still be there, you know,
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.920]   so they had to do it.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:57.680]   So that was, for me, a win-win, you know?
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:00.520]   So I had all the Americans, actually.
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:03.640]   I had Bobby Berland and I had Michael Swain
[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:08.080]   and I had Ed Liddy and I had them all coming to visit me
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.440]   at different times.
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:14.500]   Jimmy was there, you know, they wanted to be the best.
[01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:18.260]   In the end, we had such a great club atmosphere,
[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:22.500]   they wanted to come for the hard work.
[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:24.300]   And they knew that if they came,
[01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:25.700]   they were going to be dragged out
[01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:28.020]   and we were going to do physical training
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:31.020]   and it was physical training like they hadn't done before,
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:32.420]   but it wasn't just a physical training,
[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:36.620]   it was the judo and the skill side of it as well.
[01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:39.280]   And so I always had a great empathy
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:42.960]   with the US team, Olympic team.
[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:45.120]   So a lot of your Olympic medalists
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:47.160]   have been through with me, you know,
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:49.720]   and so I'm proud of that because we had, you know,
[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:52.160]   some great times and they're still great mates now.
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:56.580]   And so in New York, in a couple of weeks' time,
[01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:58.720]   I'm going to have everybody who's going to be there.
[01:59:58.720 --> 01:59:59.800]   They're all coming in.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:01.120]   - All old friends.
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:01.960]   - All old friends.
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:02.780]   - And new friends.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:07.120]   - What's a tough week look like at your peak?
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:12.120]   Physical training, randori, is there days off?
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:14.320]   Are you training like twice a day?
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:15.160]   - Twice a day.
[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:18.320]   So we do the preparation training, we do the running,
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:19.340]   we do the weight training,
[02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:22.200]   we do the skills in the morning as well.
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:26.600]   The skills is, for me, one of the biggest advantages
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:29.640]   that any full-time trainers can have.
[02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:33.000]   Because what happens is, is that with most clubs,
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.520]   you're trying to fit everything into that hour and a half
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.080]   or two hours, you know, you fit your skills,
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:42.680]   you fit your physical training and your sparring
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:45.880]   and your, you know, everything's in there, all grouped in.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:50.380]   So the biggest advantages of having a full-time group
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:52.600]   is that you can split your skills
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:55.340]   and your skills lay your foundation.
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:58.080]   So the biggest advantage is being able to work
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:01.720]   specifically on things without having to worry
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:06.400]   about getting to do your free, you know, your randori
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:09.560]   or your sparring, or then you gotta go out for,
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:11.120]   you just do the skills.
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:13.240]   - Well, when you talk about skills, like what is,
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:16.400]   say your specialty is Itai Toshi, what,
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:19.720]   are we talking about Uchikomi doing a bunch of fist,
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:21.720]   working with bands, are you doing throws,
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:23.560]   are you actually just having conversations
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:26.680]   about like specific, like tiny details of throws,
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:27.960]   like what does skills mean?
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:30.640]   - All those things about doing your repetition practice,
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:33.160]   making sure the repetition's correct,
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:34.600]   you know, there's good repetition.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:36.760]   - So when we say good repetition, does it,
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:38.600]   Uchikomi, when you're just fitting the throw
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:41.520]   versus doing the throw, where do you land on the value?
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:42.680]   - And getting it moving, you know,
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.440]   so one of the biggest, most important things
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:46.200]   is getting it moving.
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:49.440]   If we do something static, again, it's that static target,
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:50.680]   you need to get it moving.
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:52.440]   So you need to do a repetition
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:55.340]   and also you need to do a correct repetition,
[02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:58.320]   because if you're doing a hundred repetitions
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:02.480]   that are not correct and repetition's under pressure,
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:07.120]   too much pressure without somebody overseeing those skills
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:10.400]   to make sure that you correct the skills.
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:11.240]   'Cause if you're doing a skill,
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:15.880]   if you're doing it 99 times incorrectly, all right,
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:18.320]   then repetition doesn't make perfect,
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.140]   repetition makes permanent.
[02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:23.840]   So you're gonna make it as perfect as you possibly can.
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:26.960]   So actually that skills group there
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.080]   is the most important thing.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:30.740]   And what I used to do is oversee it.
[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:33.760]   So I'd oversee it to make sure that it was done properly.
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:35.600]   - So you're watching the footwork,
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.200]   you're watching the gripping,
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.440]   and then just constantly adjusting people.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:42.080]   - I'll give you an example.
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:44.600]   Jimmy Pedro, Jimmy was one of the hardest
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:46.640]   when he was 19 years of age, right?
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:50.680]   So I was, he always asking me to practice, always.
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:53.000]   So he's always on me all the time.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.360]   So I'd do groundwork with him.
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:57.000]   And could I put him on his back?
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.680]   No, I was all on him and he'll tell you,
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:02.800]   but he was just, wouldn't go.
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:06.720]   He was just, he was gonna be great, without a doubt.
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:07.760]   All right?
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:10.680]   So I wanted everybody on with him, everybody.
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:12.360]   So everybody went on with him,
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:15.840]   and so it only improved their game and it improved him.
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:18.240]   And then with small technical things
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:20.700]   that have stayed with him that we were doing,
[02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:23.200]   with the Juji Katami that was passed on to Kayla,
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.800]   and then gone on to Ronda.
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:28.640]   And it's all small things that I can see sometimes
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:30.840]   that it's passed on.
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:32.000]   - What about the Tai Otoshi?
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.400]   He said he learned a lot from you from that throw.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.480]   - And he does it differently.
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:39.640]   - And so I should mention that's one of the trickier throw.
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:42.320]   I mean, I still don't understand Tai.
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:43.440]   - It is a tricky throw.
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:44.280]   - I don't understand.
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:46.320]   So for people who don't know it,
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:49.160]   boy, how would you even explain it?
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:50.280]   It doesn't make any sense.
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:54.880]   It's when you just look solo,
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:58.080]   the movement you make is quite simple,
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:01.200]   but how you get person to be off balance,
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:04.360]   how you actually get them to be thrown.
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:06.680]   And when you do throw it successfully,
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:10.040]   it looks like a whipping motion that's effortless.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:11.040]   It makes no sense.
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:12.320]   - It makes no sense.
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:16.160]   Other than it's every technique starts with the hands.
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:17.600]   So it's what we call Kazushi,
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:19.720]   and you're pulling somebody off balance,
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:22.640]   getting them moving, pulling them off balance.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:24.160]   Tai Otoshi means body drop.
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:29.160]   So it's basically two legs across your partner's body.
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:31.760]   I've got my back to you, all right?
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:34.720]   And I've already pulled you off balance with my hands.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:36.920]   And then I'm going to just flex my legs up
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:39.120]   just as you're coming onto my back.
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.040]   And then you're going to go over.
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.960]   You know, if I coordinated all right,
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:45.560]   if it doesn't get coordinated right,
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:47.560]   then you're going to come right on my back
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:49.160]   and try to rip my arm off, you know?
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.840]   So yeah, I've got to get it right.
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:53.960]   - What was, if you can convert it to words,
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:58.640]   some secret ingredients that allows you to pull it off
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:01.400]   at the highest levels, the Tai Otoshi?
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:05.000]   - The hands start every technique.
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000]   So getting the repetition right, first of all.
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000]   So you need to get the repetition right,
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.520]   you need a good partner.
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:15.600]   So actually training your partner to react in the right way
[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:18.440]   is just as important as learning the throw.
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:20.480]   So actually what happens is, you know,
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:23.240]   we could get a lesson of beginners.
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:27.560]   We teach the throw and then go, right, off you go.
[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:30.080]   And 90% of them will get it wrong
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:32.560]   because their partner's not reacting in the right way.
[02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:37.080]   So half of it is to get the person to react as they should.
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:40.200]   So if I was doing it with you, you and I,
[02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:42.000]   first thing I'd teach you to do
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.520]   is to react the way I want you to react.
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:47.720]   And then I'd react the way that you want me to react.
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:49.920]   All right, so then we'd have success with it
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:53.280]   rather than you leaning back in the wrong way
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:56.520]   or resisting or frightened you going over.
[02:05:56.520 --> 02:06:00.680]   So, you know, so actually that's why nine times out of 10,
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.240]   people get the technique wrong.
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:03.360]   - It's actually fascinating to me
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:05.880]   'cause in the United States where I came up,
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:08.680]   Judo, I mean, the level of Judo is not comparable
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:12.240]   to the level of Judo in the rest of the world.
[02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:16.160]   Of course, the Pedro Center is an exception to that.
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:17.240]   - Certain athletes, yeah.
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:21.640]   It's a certain athletes, like when I trained recently
[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:25.600]   with Jimmy Pedro, it's like even like the 16-year-old kids
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:27.360]   are just all deadly.
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.100]   So it was terrifying.
[02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:33.800]   But, you know, I remember the Russian national team
[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.760]   came through Philadelphia.
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:38.240]   And one of the things that really impressed me
[02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:41.800]   is just how much easier Judo was, training Judo with them.
[02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:42.920]   They moved correctly.
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:46.280]   As like Uke said, as the people getting thrown,
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:50.440]   every aspect of their body movement was correct
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:53.160]   in terms of it felt right to be throwing them,
[02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:55.480]   to be training with them, everything about the gripping,
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:56.860]   about the position of their hips,
[02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:58.520]   about the shoulder, everything.
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:06:59.600]   It was fun.
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:01.200]   It was easy.
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:03.480]   And like, and I always felt like I was learning.
[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:06.660]   So I think all of that is loaded in, I guess,
[02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:08.240]   into proper training.
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:10.000]   So you're developing through the throws,
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.440]   you're developing the right technique.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:14.360]   - Yeah, you have to develop between, you know,
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:17.320]   I always had training partners that I trained with
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:18.880]   up to each Olympic games.
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:22.960]   And we worked together for the, we did the skills together.
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:25.600]   And then we, you know, we worked together
[02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:27.720]   in order to make techniques work.
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:30.560]   And we got it moving as quickly as we could.
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:33.640]   And one of the worst things that I see is,
[02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:37.160]   and I see a lot of YouTube stuff with coaches.
[02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:38.000]   - Here we go.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.680]   - Ah, don't even start me on that.
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:42.120]   Don't even start me on that.
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:46.640]   But, you know, you're laughing
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:49.680]   because you know what I'm talking about, right?
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:50.760]   - No, I'm actually laughing
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:53.080]   'cause I'm enjoying you talking trash.
[02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:57.560]   But you're talking about technique.
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:00.960]   - Yeah, just, well, you know, the coaches
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:03.000]   and their clipboard guys, you know,
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.760]   with the clipboards and the stopwatches.
[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:06.800]   And, you know, they got these kids running up
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:10.680]   and down the mat and then doing Uchikomi
[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:13.720]   of something that's technically incorrect,
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:14.840]   you know, 10 times.
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:18.000]   And then running up and doing another 10 at the other side,
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.200]   you know, and actually mixing everything together.
[02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:24.920]   And it's just a mess, you know, just technical mess.
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:28.120]   - That said, some of it is conditioning type stuff
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:28.960]   that you were doing.
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:30.720]   So what is like the hardest type
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:32.560]   of physical conditioning you were doing?
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:35.720]   - Probably ran too much, you know, when I was a kid.
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:38.880]   If I could go back now, I wouldn't run as much.
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:41.160]   And I ran hard and I ran strong.
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:44.760]   And I remember doing London Marathon one time
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:47.920]   and I said, "I'm never gonna do it again."
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:49.680]   I've never.
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:52.680]   But I ran, you know, and I was trying to,
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:55.120]   the problem was when I did the London Marathon
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:57.160]   is I was trying to beat three hours.
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:58.000]   - It's that desire to win again.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.840]   - It's totally insane, you know, it was insane.
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:04.280]   And I went out through half marathon
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:05.720]   in what I thought was a good time.
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:08.240]   Anyway, I got to 16, 17 miles
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:10.160]   and totally blew and--
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:11.480]   - So you went out too fast.
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:12.480]   - Yeah, I went out too fast.
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:13.680]   - And then you just--
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:15.560]   - I died, absolutely.
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:16.400]   - Just.
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:20.280]   - I died, I got in, I crossed the line.
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:22.960]   I remember seeing this bridge over there, right?
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:26.680]   And the bridge, it was the finishing line over the bridge.
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:28.520]   And I had to get, it was the longest bridge
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:30.920]   I've ever, ever walked over.
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:32.640]   It was like walk, run.
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.080]   So I got over the bridge
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:37.600]   and I took one step over the line like that.
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:38.960]   And there was a guy over there
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:40.960]   and he was trying to rush everybody through, you know,
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:42.280]   and he was going, "Come on, come on, come on."
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:46.160]   It was people behind me, "Get, get your hands off me."
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:47.960]   (both laughing)
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:48.800]   - Yeah.
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:49.840]   - "Get your hands off me now."
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:52.120]   Like that, 'cause we're gonna fall out, you know?
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:56.320]   And I couldn't move, I couldn't move.
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.880]   I was white.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:09:58.720]   And--
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:01.480]   - It was amazing that you made it to the finish line though.
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:03.440]   - I did, I got over there.
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:08.320]   And, you know, yeah, Donald Duck passing me was a tell.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:10.720]   - Oh, there's a person dressed as Donald Duck?
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:11.800]   - Donald Duck, yeah.
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:16.720]   But the thing was, I still crossed over 338.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:19.480]   I crossed over 338, but I lost 38 minutes
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:21.200]   in the last four miles.
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:23.760]   - So that bridge, longest bridge ever.
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:24.600]   So you regret the run?
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:27.360]   - So anyway, I would do the running a little bit differently
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:29.360]   but we ran, we ran hard.
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:31.840]   We did the weight training, we did good weight training.
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:33.400]   It was all conditioned.
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:36.360]   So, I mean, it was never the same training all the time.
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:41.360]   So it was always, we'd have certain phases building up.
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:42.800]   It was scientifically done.
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:46.040]   It wasn't just out there, run, weight training,
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:47.960]   judo, same judo all the time.
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:50.320]   It was always pretty scientific.
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:51.240]   - Good variety.
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:53.920]   - It was a good variety and it had buildup
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:56.160]   and it had a speed phase and it had a power phase
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:58.720]   and it had, you know, like a base condition.
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:00.400]   - What about the Randoi?
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:03.520]   Was there a method to the madness there?
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:04.960]   How much Randoi did you do?
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.240]   - A lot.
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:08.720]   So the most important thing for me,
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:12.480]   I mean, I see now that there's a lot of people out there
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.200]   that are not getting enough Randoi.
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:16.400]   They're not Randoi-ing enough.
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:19.280]   And there's a lot of sports science people
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.160]   and they're running and they're weight training
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:23.480]   and they're doing it all to death.
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:25.640]   And there's not enough judo.
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:28.100]   And the only ones, you know, like you have a look
[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:30.520]   at some of the Eastern block countries
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:33.960]   that are getting together, they're having these mass camps
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:37.920]   and the Japanese, they have, you know,
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:39.960]   just massive people that they can do there.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:44.760]   They're doing probably 50, 60 Randois a week.
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:45.600]   - Wait, what?
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.720]   - 50 or 60 a week.
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:48.720]   - Wow.
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:51.280]   - The average person is getting together.
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:53.200]   I mean, when I was doing Randois,
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:56.080]   when I went to Japan, it was just purely
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:59.140]   for 60 Randois a week.
[02:11:59.140 --> 02:11:59.980]   - How much is each one?
[02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:00.860]   How long is it?
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:02.740]   - So they were five minutes then.
[02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:03.980]   They're four minutes now, but--
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:05.820]   - That's a lot, especially given the level
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:07.780]   of the competition there.
[02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:10.540]   - Well, you can do it in Japan because it's fairly light.
[02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:12.100]   If they throw you, they throw you.
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:12.940]   You throw them.
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:15.780]   - So there's like a level of, like you're moving
[02:12:15.780 --> 02:12:17.420]   at like a close to a hundred percent,
[02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:20.500]   but the actual power and the force is not quite--
[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:21.860]   - Different in Korea.
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:23.620]   Korea was harder.
[02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:25.220]   It was more physical.
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:27.860]   So you couldn't do 50 Randois in Korea.
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:29.600]   You'd die.
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:30.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:31.260]   So you'd do 30.
[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:32.800]   - 50, 60 Randois, wow.
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.680]   - But you need the Randois, and so I chased the Randois.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:38.680]   So I chased them into training camps.
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:40.240]   I traced them all over my country.
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:44.640]   So I was getting 40 to 50 a week in my club,
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:49.340]   and then I would go to training camps and add more.
[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:54.440]   And I honestly don't think that they do enough now.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.360]   A lot of countries.
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:57.900]   - Somebody who doesn't know Randoi is live training, so.
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:12:59.040]   - Yeah, sparring.
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:00.920]   - Was there a few people you remember
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:03.360]   that were just like really tough to go against?
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:05.440]   You mentioned Gold Tooth.
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:06.280]   Is there others like it?
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:08.060]   - Gold Tooth was pretty horrific.
[02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:08.900]   - Yeah.
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:10.920]   (laughing)
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:11.760]   Oh, you got him in the end.
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:12.600]   - He was pretty all right.
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:15.080]   I got him in the end, and yeah.
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:19.960]   - Is there like, I suppose I should say not just tough,
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:21.680]   but just good training partners that you like?
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:22.540]   - Great training partners.
[02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:25.200]   I remember when Nishida, and Nishida was,
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:28.180]   I mentioned him earlier, said he was one of the best.
[02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:30.780]   I mean, he was just such a great technician.
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:33.960]   So I would go there to his dojo,
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:35.480]   and he'd ask me to practice.
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:37.720]   And he'd always, he'd finish the practice,
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:39.520]   and you know that he would always say,
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.960]   "Another one, we'll do another one," right?
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:43.520]   So you'd go, "Oh, yeah."
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:47.240]   Because you had to make out that you weren't that bothered,
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:48.960]   that you had to do another one.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.280]   So you do another one back to back,
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:52.680]   and then he'd go sometimes, "Let's do another one."
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:55.440]   So you'd end up doing 15 minutes with the same guy
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:57.440]   who could possibly throw you at any time,
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:59.920]   you know, and that was hard, you know?
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:04.520]   But I remember those particular guys,
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:06.120]   and there were plenty of those.
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:07.360]   - What do you do with the exhaustion
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:08.800]   that you're feeling in those?
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:11.600]   Like, how deep did you go in terms of like--
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:12.440]   - You have to dig deep.
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:14.980]   And I think that that was the great thing
[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:18.560]   about having certain, like European training camps
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:20.200]   were more physical.
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:24.600]   So I remember that we would have European training camps
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:27.120]   where you'd fight Germans, and then the Dutch,
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:30.840]   and then the French, and then the Russian,
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:34.680]   or you'd have all sorts of different styles
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:36.640]   and people there to fight.
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.800]   And that was something then you'd have to dig in
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:43.080]   at a different place, come out of there.
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:45.560]   - Well, where do you go mentally when you,
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:47.240]   how many times have you gone there,
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:50.520]   or like you're really in deep waters exhaustion-wise
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:53.640]   in competition, actually?
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:55.480]   - Competition, it's happened.
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:58.720]   You know, so sometimes you go past
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:01.160]   where your forearms are absolutely blown.
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:05.960]   I remember the final of Czech tournament that we had
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:09.960]   and fought a Frenchman in the final,
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:14.400]   and my forearms were so blown, I couldn't shake his hand,
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:15.240]   you know?
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:19.560]   And then I remember they were solid, absolutely solid,
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:21.400]   and they had lactic acid in them.
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:25.080]   And I remember I stood on the rostrum this,
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:27.240]   and they were giving me things,
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:29.720]   and I couldn't grip them properly.
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:32.620]   So I was saying, put it under my armpit or, you know,
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:34.960]   chin, like that, I was trying to hold this.
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.800]   I couldn't hold anything, you know?
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:40.160]   So there are times when I really had to go really deep.
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:43.800]   I remember fighting two East Germans the same day,
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:45.600]   one of the competitions,
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:49.020]   and the number one and the number two East Germans.
[02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:53.380]   And that was another day where I had to really dig deep.
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:54.840]   - That's the fascinating thing
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:57.840]   about some of these tournaments is if you get,
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:01.400]   if you go full distance on several matches in a row,
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:03.680]   the way you're seeing in the finals
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:07.360]   are two people that have like fought a lot that day.
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:09.720]   - Yeah, and we have golden score now, you know?
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:11.460]   So we see a lot of guys, you know,
[02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:12.760]   that going into golden score,
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:15.040]   and they've done one contest in four minutes,
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:16.360]   and then they go another four minutes,
[02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:18.020]   and then, you know, we've had some go
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:19.520]   into a third four minutes.
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:21.120]   This is all back to back.
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:22.240]   It might be in the first round.
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:23.840]   It might be in the final, you know?
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:26.200]   And we've got some now that are coming out,
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:28.320]   and you can see the stats,
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:31.200]   and the ones that win in golden score.
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:33.800]   So we got a Japanese Hashimoto.
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:36.880]   He's the Japanese representative now,
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:39.320]   instead of Ono, 'cause Ono's finished.
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:40.840]   So Hashimoto's coming out.
[02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:43.120]   He was in a tournament last week, and he went--
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:44.280]   - Is there a good one to look up?
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:46.400]   - Yeah, just have a look at him.
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:48.800]   So Hashimoto's in white here, all right?
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:51.960]   And there's a great example there.
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:53.720]   Well, I'm glad we got onto that, you know?
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:57.060]   So, I mean, he has got great technique, Hashimoto.
[02:16:57.060 --> 02:16:57.900]   - Effortless, effortless.
[02:16:57.900 --> 02:16:59.480]   - There's the Tai Otoshi, all right?
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:01.960]   So you can see exactly what we're talking about there.
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:04.340]   Great timing.
[02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:09.560]   And again, you know, sometimes he backs them up to the edge,
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:12.580]   and then he'll wait for them to come back in,
[02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:14.880]   towards, they don't want to step out to get a penalty.
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:16.440]   - I guess that's a cross grip Tai Otoshi.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:17.880]   I didn't see that wrong.
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:19.680]   - Yeah, cross grip, different grips.
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:20.960]   Oh, great examples there.
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:22.380]   Just what we were talking about.
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:23.720]   (laughing)
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:26.440]   - Making it look so easy, wow.
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:30.240]   - So he's gonna be their representative at 73 kilograms.
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:32.000]   Look at him, back him up again,
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.640]   and again, just catching him as he pushes back.
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:37.280]   - So push, push, push, and then--
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:40.120]   - Yeah, action reaction at his best there.
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:42.920]   And a slight change of direction,
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:45.640]   he sometimes goes down onto his knee there,
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:46.720]   which is Si Otoshi.
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:49.480]   It turns from Tai Otoshi, which is springing up,
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:51.360]   to Si Otoshi that's going down.
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:54.800]   - Oh, the title of the video is,
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:57.240]   his Tai Otoshi is a work of art.
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:17:59.760]   - Yeah, this is him at his best,
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:02.660]   showing him doing what he does best.
[02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:06.520]   But he had to go three times into golden score last week.
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:08.120]   And dig deep.
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:09.520]   And lost one of 'em, I think.
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:10.880]   - But you're still going at it.
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:13.600]   You talk about all those training sessions.
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:15.920]   Nikki, your wonderful wife, told me that you were looking,
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:18.040]   you were going all over, like from target to target,
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:19.600]   looking for workout clothes.
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:21.520]   'Cause your luggage got lost.
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:23.280]   'Cause you had to get a workout in.
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:25.000]   - Yeah, you know what, I just,
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.360]   I realize that if I'm a miserable git,
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:32.080]   right, then she'll get me into the gym, you know, so.
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:34.680]   And the thing is, is that I'm better
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:36.080]   if I get in there for an hour,
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:37.480]   and I just do something.
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:41.280]   At least 30, 35 to 40 minutes cardio,
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:43.120]   and then I do some weights.
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:45.000]   And more high repetitions.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.960]   It's not so much heavy weights now,
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:48.360]   but more functional stuff.
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:49.720]   - I mean, you travel all over the world
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:52.440]   for the commentary of these competitions.
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:56.320]   So is it sometimes a challenge to figure out how?
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:58.800]   - Well, you know, during COVID,
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:01.120]   then they closed all the gyms.
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:02.520]   But we were still going out.
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:04.480]   We were one of the first ones out.
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:07.480]   The judo was some of the first out.
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:09.880]   The competitions were behind closed doors.
[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:11.720]   So we were in the hotel.
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:15.200]   The gym was closed, so we couldn't use the gyms.
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:19.960]   So we had to look for other ways that we could work out.
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:23.280]   So most of the hotels that we were in
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:25.120]   were high-rise hotels.
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:26.800]   So we were in the steps.
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:30.040]   We were doing the steps right the way up, you know.
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:34.680]   So I started it, and so I started off with me going up,
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:37.240]   and then one or two of the others and the referees
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:39.240]   started to go up with me.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:42.000]   So in the end, we'd have this trail of people
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.760]   going up the steps and down,
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:46.800]   and every place we went to, we had the steps.
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:50.200]   So yeah, that was an interesting situation.
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:52.520]   So we were sick of steps in the end.
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:56.680]   - What advice would you give to beginners,
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:19:57.920]   people starting out in judo,
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:02.360]   how to develop their game,
[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:06.920]   how to find the beauty in the sport and the art of judo?
[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:11.280]   - If you put 10 people in a room and said,
[02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:15.160]   "Right, get on with it," you'd have mayhem, right?
[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:20.280]   And I think that whatever sport you're doing,
[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:23.040]   you need good instruction, good teaching,
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:24.680]   and a good club atmosphere, you know,
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:28.440]   somewhere that's not so intense
[02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:32.480]   that winning is the only thing.
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:35.040]   And I think that if you look at 90% of the people
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:38.120]   that practice martial arts are doing it for pleasure,
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:39.160]   so they wanna get pleasure.
[02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:42.080]   So you need a club that's got a bit of a mixture.
[02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:44.560]   You know, they've got a direction
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:47.400]   to go into competition if they want,
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:51.120]   and then the rest, it's for fun and to enjoy it,
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:53.600]   but with really good instruction,
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:55.240]   because with really good instruction
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:20:57.800]   and a good foundation and a good base,
[02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:02.720]   you get more enjoyment because you have more success.
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:03.960]   And let's be honest, you know,
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:05.840]   the more success we have with something,
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:07.320]   the more we like it.
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:08.880]   - Yeah, and great technique is a way
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:11.240]   to really discover the beauty of the art.
[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:14.560]   And so great teaching is really important there.
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:16.760]   - Great teaching is so important.
[02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:21.520]   - What does it take to get from the early days
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:26.120]   when you started judo to world-class level?
[02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:29.600]   - I think that with most, I mean, you do hear, don't you?
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:32.280]   You know, if somebody's been doing judo for eight years
[02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:35.640]   and then they're in, and I think it happened,
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:38.080]   one of the French, Chameo,
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:41.600]   she went to the Olympic Games in 2012
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:43.800]   and she'd been doing judo for eight years,
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:45.440]   but then she started to lose, you know,
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:48.120]   so she had a relative success early on
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:49.440]   and the Olympics was one of them.
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:51.240]   She got a silver medal,
[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:54.840]   but then she went off the boil and then she came back
[02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:58.080]   and now she's been there for, she's still competing,
[02:21:58.080 --> 02:22:01.720]   and she's been there for well over 13 years
[02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:02.600]   at the very top.
[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:06.320]   So I think that, you know, any foundation,
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:10.280]   it's like anything, if you lay a really solid foundation,
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:12.320]   generally it lasts longer.
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:15.160]   - Yeah, but that foundation, again, is that technique
[02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:19.040]   or is there, what does it take to build that foundation?
[02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:22.120]   - I think technique, you get away with murder, you know?
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:25.960]   With technique, you can get away with, you know,
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:27.360]   having bad condition, you know,
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:30.200]   but I mean, you get found out in the end,
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:32.920]   but you can, you know, you can go out
[02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:34.920]   and you can win certain things
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:37.320]   by doing really nice technique.
[02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:38.760]   But I think if you've got the mixture,
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:39.760]   if you've got the whole package,
[02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:42.080]   then you can, you know, go the whole way.
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:44.360]   - So for people who somehow don't know,
[02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:48.240]   you've commentated some of the greatest judo matches ever.
[02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:52.560]   You've done Grand Prixs, you've done all these events,
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:54.840]   Olympics, championship, everything.
[02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:58.240]   So what, just looking at the history of judo,
[02:22:58.240 --> 02:22:59.280]   what like stands out to you?
[02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:01.000]   What events stand out to you?
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.920]   What are some good memories that popped to your head?
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:06.720]   - I think, you know, some of the Paris tournaments
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:11.240]   are amazing because the crowd, they're there.
[02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:13.640]   You know, they're on the mat, they're all judoka,
[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:16.000]   they're all, they're well-educated to the sport.
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.480]   Every time somebody twitches, you know,
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:20.280]   they're very biased towards their own,
[02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:22.480]   which is kind of you expect.
[02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:24.160]   But, you know, sometimes I haven't been able
[02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:26.160]   to hear myself speak.
[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:27.240]   And that's very unusual.
[02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:28.440]   You know, you've got the headphones on
[02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:30.000]   and you're blocked out, you know.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.280]   And like sometimes Teddy Rene's been walking out there
[02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:37.040]   and the crowd are going crazy and they're on their feet,
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:39.600]   you know, when somebody twitches and, you know,
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:41.840]   and then you get the crowd silences.
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:43.480]   We had one of those last week.
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:45.200]   You know, everybody's cheering their man
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.040]   and then bang, their man goes over.
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:48.520]   - Yeah, and there's silence.
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:50.640]   - Silence, nothing like that.
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:52.560]   And of course we were commentating,
[02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:55.480]   we were going, that was a bit of a crowd silencer,
[02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:57.800]   you know, but yeah, that happens.
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:00.200]   - Yeah, that is a surprising thing that,
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:02.760]   at least it was to me, that Paris and France
[02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:04.000]   is really big on judo.
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:05.320]   - Massive.
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:07.480]   You know, and there's always surprises.
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:11.760]   You know, it's like Paris is great.
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:14.040]   In Japan for the Olympic Games,
[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:17.040]   the biggest surprise was Ono getting beaten
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:17.880]   in the team event.
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:19.720]   Now Ono's the greatest judo man,
[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:22.200]   pound for pound, probably one of the best.
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:24.000]   And he won the Olympic title.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.920]   And then they went into the team event against France
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:31.880]   and Ono lost to a, he's not run of the mill German,
[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:33.520]   but the German, you know,
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:37.360]   it wasn't certainly Olympic title-esque.
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:41.120]   And beat Ono.
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:43.560]   - Yeah, well the team stuff is fascinating.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:44.400]   - Yeah, it's fascinating, yes.
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:46.160]   - It changes the dynamics of the whole thing.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:47.000]   - Yeah.
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.920]   - And it's, I mean, it's funny you say Paris,
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:52.920]   it really makes it really big deal
[02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:55.520]   that this Olympics is being held in Paris.
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:59.560]   - And they'll be the team to beat, French team.
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:02.120]   Because they have the best balance of the weight categories.
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:04.480]   They have the best balance with their people
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:06.400]   that are world and Olympic champions
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:09.960]   and qualified men and women.
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:11.560]   So three men, three women.
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:13.840]   They have the best balance out of anybody.
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:15.760]   - And an educated audience.
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:18.640]   - Educated audience, home grounds.
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:19.480]   - It's gonna be awesome.
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:20.320]   - It's gonna be mad.
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:21.160]   - It's gonna be super fun.
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:22.000]   - It will be super fun.
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:22.820]   - You nervous?
[02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:23.660]   - Yeah.
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:24.480]   - All right.
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:25.320]   - Do you get nervous?
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:26.760]   - I get nervous, I get nervous.
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:27.600]   - I do as well, I get really nervous.
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:30.040]   - I'm nervous right now.
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:33.680]   But given, especially 'cause it's the Olympics
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:36.000]   and you don't want to,
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.960]   you want to celebrate people properly, right?
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:40.760]   And it's like, it's everything for them.
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:41.600]   - Yeah.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:44.640]   - And a lot of people, especially like the finals matches,
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:49.800]   it'll be watched millions of times,
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:51.800]   the highest of stakes, all of this.
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:52.760]   - Played over and over.
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:53.600]   - Yeah.
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.120]   - And I find that with mine,
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:57.760]   I'm now a little bit more careful.
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:00.760]   So I'll celebrate a massive throw
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:03.640]   and then have empathy to the one that's been thrown
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:05.960]   because it's not the best feeling in the world.
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:08.480]   Especially in Olympic finals.
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:09.320]   - Yeah.
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:10.160]   - Can you imagine that?
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:11.320]   - Yeah.
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:12.440]   - Must be terrible.
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:15.000]   - Must be terrible, yeah.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.800]   - Just reflecting.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:18.920]   So now I have a bit of empathy there
[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:22.840]   and I just, I try and say the right things
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:25.400]   because they always do come up to me and say,
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:27.400]   you commentated my fights.
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:29.800]   - Yeah, you're the voice of the biggest triumphs
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:32.440]   and the biggest tragedies for these athletes,
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:35.040]   for the world that watches and admires these athletes.
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:35.880]   - No pressure.
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:36.960]   - You're the voice.
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:38.040]   Don't screw it up, yeah?
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:39.720]   - Don't screw it up.
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:42.760]   - Your voice is in my head when I watch these,
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:45.120]   you know, it's fascinating.
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:46.080]   It's fascinating.
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:48.160]   But you're a master of it.
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:52.880]   It's a huge honor that you would talk with me.
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:55.360]   Thank you for everything you've done
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:57.600]   for the sport of judo, for the Olympics,
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:26:59.560]   for just sports in general.
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:02.760]   Just celebrating greatness in all of its forms.
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:03.720]   Thank you for talking today.
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:04.640]   Keep going.
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:07.360]   I can't wait to listen to you in Paris.
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:08.440]   - Thank you for having me.
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:12.520]   - And it's just been an honor to be here with you.
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:15.080]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:16.080]   with Neil Adams.

[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.960]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:21.920]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:24.480]   from Miyamoto Musashi.
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:26.480]   There's nothing outside of yourself
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:28.320]   that can ever enable you to get better,
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:31.080]   stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter.
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:33.440]   Everything is within.
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:35.360]   Everything exists.
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:37.720]   Seek nothing outside of yourself.
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:42.080]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:44.680]   (upbeat music)
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:47.280]   (upbeat music)
