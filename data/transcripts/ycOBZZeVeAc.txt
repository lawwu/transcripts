[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.920]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.640]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.800]   Today, my guest is Rick Rubin.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.240]   Rick Rubin is credited with being one of the most creative
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.960]   and prolific music producers of all time.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.740]   The range of artists with whom he's worked with
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.160]   and discovered is absolutely staggering,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.400]   ranging from artists such as LL Cool J, Public Enemy,
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.600]   Minor Threat, Fugazi, Beastie Boys,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.640]   Jesus and Mary Chain, Jay-Z, Red Hot Chili Peppers,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.680]   Metallica, Green Day, Tom Petty, System of a Down,
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.180]   Joe Strummer, Kanye West, Johnny Cash,
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.660]   Adele, and many, many more.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.180]   Not surprisingly, therefore,
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.940]   Rick is considered somewhat of an enigma.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.080]   That is, people want to know how it is that one individual
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.920]   is able to extract the best creative artistry
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.720]   from so many different people
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.080]   in so many different genres of music.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.720]   Well, as today's discussion reveals,
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.920]   Rick's expertise in the creative process
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.560]   extends well beyond music.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.960]   In fact, our conversation takes us into the realm
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.400]   of what the creative process is specifically
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.800]   and generally across domains, including music, of course,
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.360]   but also writing, film, science,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.940]   and essentially all domains
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.760]   in which new original thought, ideas,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.720]   and production of anything becomes important.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.200]   Our conversation ventures from abstract themes,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.240]   such as what is creativity and where does it stem from,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.360]   to the more concrete,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.600]   everyday tool-based approaches to creativity,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.800]   including those that Rick himself uses
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.140]   and that he's seen other people use to great success.
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.100]   That took us down some incredible avenues,
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.600]   ranging from a discussion about the subconscious
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.480]   to how the subconscious interacts with our conscious mind
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.040]   and how the subconscious and conscious mind
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.220]   interact with nature around us and within us.
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.640]   Indeed, our conversation got rather scientific at times,
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.020]   but all with an eye and an ear
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.840]   toward understanding the practical tools
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.980]   that any and all of us can use
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.320]   in order to access the creative process.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.660]   We also spent some time talking about Rick's new book,
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.500]   which is all about creativity and ways to access creativity.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.800]   The title of the book is "The Creative Act,
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.920]   "A Way of Being" by Rick Rubin.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.500]   This is a book that I've now read three times
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.960]   from cover to cover,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.640]   and I'm now reading it a fourth time
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.700]   because it is so rich with wisdom and information
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.840]   that I'm applying in multiple domains of my life,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.640]   not just my work, but my everyday life.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.840]   I cannot recommend it highly enough.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.800]   Rick has an incredible ability
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.420]   to translate his understanding of the creative process
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.580]   in a way that is meaningful for anybody.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.980]   So if you're in music, if you're a musician,
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.400]   it will certainly be meaningful for you,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.240]   but it is not about music.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.920]   It is about the creative process.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   And so whether or not you consider yourself
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.520]   somebody creative or not,
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.380]   or whether or not you seek to be more creative,
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.180]   Rick's book in today's conversation sheds light
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.660]   on what I believe to be the fundamental features
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.460]   of what makes us human beings.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.580]   That is what allows us unlike other animals
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.680]   to look out on the landscape around us,
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.340]   to examine our inner landscape
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.880]   and to come up with truly novel ideas
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.220]   that thrill us, entertain us, entertain other people,
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.440]   scare us, make us laugh, make us cry.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.480]   All the things that make life rich
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.240]   are essentially contained in the creative process.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.220]   And to be able to sit down and learn from the Rick Rubin,
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.300]   how the creative process emerges in him
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.540]   and his observations about how it can best emerge in others
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.300]   is and was truly a gift.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.960]   So I'm excited to share his knowledge with you today.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.440]   One thing that you'll quickly come to notice
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.120]   about today's conversation
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.600]   is that Rick is incredibly generous with his knowledge
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.180]   about the creative process.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.080]   In fact, he very graciously and spontaneously, I should add,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.980]   offered to answer your questions about creativity.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.880]   So if you have questions
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.660]   about the creative process for Rick,
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.240]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.800]   And in order to make those questions
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.600]   a bit easier for me to find,
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.640]   please put question for Rick Rubin in capitals,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.560]   then colon or dash, whichever you choose,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.040]   and then put your question there.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.080]   I do ask that you keep the questions relatively short
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.140]   so that I can ask Rick
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.160]   as many of those questions as possible.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.880]   We will record that conversation
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.560]   and we will post it as a clip
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.240]   on the Huberman Lab Clips channel.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.860]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.520]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.780]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.360]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.940]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.260]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.900]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.000]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.400]   which I can confidently say is the most nutrient-dense
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.340]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.020]   Maui Nui spent nearly a decade
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.100]   building a USDA-certified wild harvesting system
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.320]   to help balance invasive deer populations
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.880]   on the island of Maui.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.480]   I've talked before on this podcast
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.240]   and we've had guests on this podcast
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.220]   that have emphasized the critical role
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.120]   of getting quality protein,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.480]   not just for muscle repair and protein synthesis,
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.400]   but also for repair of all tissues,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.600]   including brain tissue on a day-to-day basis.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.260]   And the general rule of thumb for that
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.280]   is one gram of quality protein
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.400]   per pound of body weight per day.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.080]   With Maui Nui meats, you can accomplish that very easily
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.000]   and you can do that without ingesting an excess of calories,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.880]   which is also critical for immediate and long-term health.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.200]   I should say that Maui Nui meats
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.480]   are not only extremely high quality,
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   but they are also delicious.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.560]   I particularly like their jerky, so their venison jerky.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.420]   I also have had Maui Nui venison in various recipes,
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.940]   including ground venison, some venison steaks,
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.940]   and I love the taste of the venison.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.380]   It's lean, but it doesn't taste overly lean or dry at all.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.080]   It's incredibly delicious.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.860]   So if you'd like to try Maui Nui venison,
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.620]   go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.340]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.580]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.700]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.140]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.220]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.620]   And as many of you have probably heard me say before,
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.540]   I am not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.080]   because nootropics means smart drugs.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.840]   And frankly, the brain doesn't work that way.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.220]   The brain has neural circuits for focus.
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.580]   It also has neural circuits for creativity
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.540]   and neural circuits for task switching
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.020]   and for imagination and for memory.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.060]   There is no such thing as a neural circuit for being smart.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.820]   And therefore the word nootropics
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.820]   doesn't really apply to anything specific neurobiologically
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.700]   speaking.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.300]   Thesis understands this
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.520]   and therefore has designed custom nootropics
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.780]   that are tailored to your unique needs.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.700]   I've been using Thesis for over a year now
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.580]   and their nootropic formulas have been a game changer for me
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.480]   in particular, in the realm of cognitive work.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.180]   My go-to formula for when I'm doing any kind of cognitive
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.840]   work is their clarity formula.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.420]   That's the one I've been using most often lately.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.140]   If you'd like to try Thesis customized nootropics,
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.500]   you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.960]   You'll take a brief three minute quiz
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.100]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.520]   to try in your first month.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.140]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.900]   and use the code Huberman at checkout

[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.580]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Whoop.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.140]   Whoop is a fitness wearable device
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.380]   that tracks your daily activity and sleep,
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.660]   but goes beyond activity and sleep tracking
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.220]   to provide real-time feedback
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.740]   on how to adjust your training and sleep schedules
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.860]   in order to feel and perform better.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.740]   Six months ago, I started working with Whoop
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.340]   as a member of their scientific advisory council
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.260]   as a way to help Whoop advance their mission
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.340]   of unlocking human performance.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.900]   And as a Whoop user, I've experienced firsthand
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.260]   the health benefits of their technology.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.160]   It's clear based on quality research
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.420]   that Whoop can inform you how well you're sleeping,
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.780]   how to change your sleep habits,
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.340]   how to change your activity habits,
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.140]   even how to modify different aspects of your nutrition,
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.220]   exercise, sleep, and lifestyle
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.180]   in order to maximize your mental health,

[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.300]   Great to have you here today, Rick.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.460]   - Thank you for having me, it's a pleasure.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.020]   - So of all the topics in science
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.860]   and in particular in neuroscience,
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.500]   I confess that creativity is the most difficult one
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.300]   to capture because you can find papers,
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.300]   scientific studies that is on convergent thinking
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.180]   versus divergent thinking and there are definitions
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.120]   to these and they take on different forms.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.060]   But in a strict definition form,
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.760]   it seems that creativity has something to do
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.840]   with either rearranging existing elements
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.520]   or coming up with new elements.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.380]   But as I went into your book,
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.060]   which I've done twice, I've read it twice.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.780]   And by the way, I feel so blessed and honored
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.860]   to have gotten an early copy from you
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.740]   or a final copy early, that is.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.300]   But having gone through it twice,
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.260]   I'm now convinced that there may not actually
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.700]   be an internal source of creativity
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.420]   that exists on its own, right?
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.900]   And the example that you give that for me
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.300]   really is serving as an anchor
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.440]   and tell me if I'm wrong here
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.300]   is this idea that ideas and creativity
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.680]   are a little bit like a cloud.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.300]   If you look at it at one moment,
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.900]   you might think that it looks like one thing
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.500]   where it has a certain shape and texture.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.880]   But then you look at it a moment later,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.820]   it could be quite a bit different.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.640]   And if you look at an hour later,
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.560]   it very well could be gone.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.420]   And the reason I think that serves
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.700]   as such a powerful hook for me to think about creativity
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.320]   and why I think neuroscientists and scientists in general
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.420]   have never actually captured a way
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.100]   to even talk about creativity
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.860]   stems from somebody that you knew in person.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.740]   But as you know, I greatly admire,
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.900]   I don't have many heroes, but I would put Joe Strummer
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.860]   among the short list of heroes that I have.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.460]   And I remember once an interview with him,
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.120]   fairly disjointed, he was sort of often different tangents
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.060]   that I couldn't follow.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.660]   But at one point, he just kind of blurted out
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.440]   that if you have an idea, you have to write it down
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   and you may end up throwing it away,
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.400]   but if you wait, it will be gone.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.480]   And I remember that, and as a consequence,
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.680]   I have a whole system that I use to try and capture ideas.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.420]   But what are your thoughts on what Joe said,
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.600]   this cloud idea that comes up in one form
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.920]   in one area of the book,
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.160]   but then I think is thread throughout the book
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.040]   in different ways, how did that come to you
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.660]   and how does it serve you in trying to,
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.380]   I don't want to say extract, but trying to access creativity?
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.380]   - I think the best way to think about it is like a dream.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.000]   It's like, if you think about your dreams,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.560]   they don't necessarily make sense.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.820]   When you wake up, you might remember part,
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.140]   but not the whole thing.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:24.260]   Then if you start writing them down, they'll come back
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.980]   and they may not make sense to you.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.100]   There'll be a series of abstract images
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.820]   and maybe someday in the future,
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.540]   you'll be able to look back and understand what they mean
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.020]   and maybe not.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:44.020]   And that's sort of how the art making process works.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.580]   It's like we're making things
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.540]   and we're looking for feeling in ourselves.
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:54.540]   And it could be a feeling of excitement or enthusiasm,
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.900]   a feeling of interest, a feeling of curiosity,
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.500]   I want to know more, feeling of leaning forward.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:07.860]   And we're following that energy in our body
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.500]   when we feel this, there's something here,
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.140]   there's something here, I want to know more,
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.140]   I want to know more, I want to know more.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.740]   But it's not, I'll say it's not an intellectual process.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.420]   It's a different thing.
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.820]   That's why it's hard even to talk about it
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.900]   because it's so elusive.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.860]   - Recently, I was listening to a podcast
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.020]   by our friend Lex Friedman.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.360]   I think it was an episode with Balaji Srinivasan
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   where with Balaji, who's a investor type guy,
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.420]   thinker type guy, this is like an eight hour episode.
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.060]   He says something at the beginning
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.660]   that I'd love your thoughts on.
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.020]   He said, look, we can train a rat
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.380]   to lever press every other time
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.260]   or to expect reward on every even number press
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.960]   or every odd number press or even every fifth number press,
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.660]   but a human and a rat can't do that
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.260]   for like prime number presses.
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.660]   You can't actually train that.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.260]   And then you think about the reward systems
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.840]   and the way that we follow life
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.140]   from when we get up until we go to sleep.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.260]   And what he said is the fact that we can't do that
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.480]   means that we may not actually be in touch
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.200]   with the best schedules of doing things.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.100]   Like every time I'm thirsty, I take a sip.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.460]   I assume that's the right way to do it,
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.600]   but it might not be optimal, right?
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.720]   Optimal for whatever purpose.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.700]   When I was reading your book,
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.700]   I was thinking about there's a set of things to follow,
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.880]   things to pay attention to, you talk about this,
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.300]   things to access that none of the creative process
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.180]   comes from just within us.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.460]   It can, but it's always being fed by things outside of it.
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.860]   And so what I started to do is the second time
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.140]   I read through the book was think about it
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.280]   through the lens of what Balaji was saying was that
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.020]   there may not even be a language
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.740]   for this thing that we call accessing creativity.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.400]   I mean, there's a process,
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.620]   but that language in the form of words
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.500]   is a little bit like trying to use even numbers
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.220]   to try and access prime numbers.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.500]   Like the math becomes so convoluted
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.140]   that we end up in a conversation like this
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.040]   where I'm confident we can get to the kernels of it
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.940]   because what's remarkable about the book is that you do,
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.440]   you show and inform the process,
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.220]   but there may not be a English or any other language
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.220]   for saying do this, then this, then this, then this,
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.980]   and you'll have something of creative value.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.020]   Does that capture it?
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.680]   - Yes, I think language is insufficient to,
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.740]   to drill down on creativity.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.740]   It's more, it's closer to magic than it is science.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.340]   - So when kids come into the world,
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.940]   do you think that they have better access
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.740]   to this creative process than we do as adults?
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.380]   Because we start to impart rule plays and books like,
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.840]   will it get likes, will people like it?
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.680]   But also like all the things that are available to us
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.900]   that we're not paying attention to,
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.220]   like the texture of this table, right?
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.880]   They, we're discarding things kind of systematically.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.940]   We get quote unquote set in our ways.
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.120]   Do you think kids are more, are just by definition
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.500]   and by design more creative than adults?
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.500]   - Yes, kids are, they're open and they have no baggage.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.460]   They don't have any belief system.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.620]   They don't know how things are supposed to work.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.540]   They just see what is.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.940]   And if we pay attention to what is, we learn,
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.040]   we learn much more than if we,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:00.240]   most of us select from an endless number of data points
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:07.100]   available to us to, well, as a species,
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.940]   to make sure that we don't die and to procreate
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.220]   and to feed ourselves
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.860]   are probably the primary functions first.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.580]   And then we learn things about what's right and what's wrong
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.540]   and we learn things about how to do certain things
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:28.840]   or we're inspired by someone who makes something we love
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.180]   and we want to do it the way they do it.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.740]   And all of those things undermine the purity
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.380]   of the creative process.
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.380]   They can be tools to build your skillset
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.100]   to be able to do it yourself.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.420]   Like if you're a singer,
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.160]   you might imitate a singer you really like for a while
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.800]   to get good at it
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.660]   and then eventually come to find your own voice.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.040]   It doesn't always start with your own voice.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.020]   But if you're three years old or five years old
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.780]   and you try singing, you're not singing like anyone else.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.140]   You're singing with your own voice.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.760]   And when you make something,
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.400]   you're making it based on not knowing.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.520]   And I think I had the advantage early in my career
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.240]   of starting making music without any experience,
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.080]   which was helpful
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.340]   because I didn't know what rules I was breaking.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.520]   And so it wasn't intentional breaking of rules.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.040]   I just did what seemed right to me,
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.760]   but I didn't realize that I was doing things
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.800]   that other people wouldn't do.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.160]   - I mean, there is this idea that there are no new ideas.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.600]   You know, I sort of disagree
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.600]   because every once in a while I'll see or hear something
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.620]   that at least seems different enough.
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:52.240]   - I think it's a new combination of existing ideas
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.280]   presented in a new way.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.960]   I think that's how it works.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.320]   I don't know.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.960]   But I will say it does seem like
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.060]   the things that are most interesting to me
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.220]   have a series of familiar elements
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.500]   joined together in a way that it's creating something
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.540]   that I've never seen before.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:16.140]   - You mentioned that when you are close to
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.460]   or you see hints of creativity,
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.060]   that is of real value, that it's a feeling.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.180]   And I also believe that the body
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.420]   is a great source of information.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.560]   Which, you know, once people will realize
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.080]   that the brain of course is in the skull,
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.840]   but the nervous system extends everywhere in the body.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.920]   The whole mind-body thing just falls away.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.140]   You know, philosophers have argued about this forever,
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.440]   but it's a silly argument.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.520]   It's also true that, you know,
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.720]   God forbid I were to amputate all my limbs,
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.680]   have them amputated, I'd fundamentally still be me, right?
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.840]   The same is not true.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.980]   If we took about big enough chunk of my brain
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.960]   and I still survived,
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.480]   I would be fundamentally different human being.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.400]   I'd still have the same name and identity
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.540]   and social security number,
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.780]   but I would behave very differently.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.060]   Who knows, maybe better.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:11.920]   The signals from the body we know,
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.480]   or at least we assume are pretty generic.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.040]   Like I can think of 50 different ways
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.620]   or a hundred ways that we could talk about creativity today
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.980]   and we could define it and redefine it and carve it up
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.740]   and serve it up like sushi in a bunch of different ways.
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.380]   But the body sends signals that most of us
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.740]   are, we have a kind of course understanding of.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.980]   It's like, oh, my stomach hurts or my stomach feels good,
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.080]   or I'm not sensing my stomach.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.560]   Or, oh, that feels good.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.400]   It feels warm.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.220]   It feels cool.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.400]   Most of us aren't trained in understanding
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.840]   how to interpret those signals.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.960]   So it's almost like you have a few vowels,
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.560]   a few syllables, and there isn't a lot more.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.040]   Whereas when we talk about our thoughts
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.940]   and our experiences,
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.920]   depending on how hyperverbal somebody is
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.280]   and how much emphasis they put on different sounds,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.320]   it's kind of near infinite, right?
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.060]   Not infinite, but near infinite.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.120]   So for you personally,
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.920]   when you know that you're on the end
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.080]   of a thread of creativity,
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.500]   maybe you're listening to an artist
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.600]   or you're hearing something and you're like there
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.380]   and your antennae start to deflect in a certain way, right?
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.380]   Do you feel that in your body as a recognizable sensation
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.680]   or is it a thought and a sensation?
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.200]   - It's a feeling in my body.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.800]   - Is it localized?
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.520]   - No, it's a feeling of,
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.180]   I would say it's like a surge of energy.
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.560]   - Do you remember the first time you experienced that?
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.480]   - Probably, you know, hearing the Beatles
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.620]   when I was three or four years old.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.720]   - Three or four years old?
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.560]   - Yeah.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.520]   - Wow.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.340]   - Yeah.
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.180]   - Is there something wrong with me
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.040]   that the Beatles have never done it for me?
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.040]   - No, maybe just weren't exposed at the right time
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.880]   in the right way.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.040]   There's no right or wrong way.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.120]   And everyone, I can love the Beatles and you can not,
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.960]   and we're both right.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.080]   You know, there's not a-
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.320]   - I'm glad we can still be friends.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.160]   I was a little concerned.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   I was a little scared to ask that question.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.200]   I know my taste in music is a little bit obscure
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.960]   and kind of fragmentary, but okay, good.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.020]   I've always felt like, gosh,
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.120]   there must be something wrong with me.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.340]   I like their songs, but there's no juice for me there.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.040]   - I think maybe we'll watch,
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.760]   there was an eight part series called the Beatles Anthology,
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.600]   which is out of print,
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.160]   but I can try to find it somewhere
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.300]   and we can watch that together.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.140]   - Okay.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.620]   - Maybe that'll make the case for the Beatles.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.460]   - Okay.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.840]   Yeah, but I mean, nothing against them.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.300]   It's just, and I'm always bothering you for story,
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.520]   but like Ramones, I saw that and I was like, wow,
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.960]   like jeans, aviators,
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.400]   everyone had to change their last name to Ramone.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.800]   A lot of them hated each other.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.380]   There's so much drama in there and three chords and just,
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.880]   but to me, it just was like, wow,
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.460]   like kids from New York, that energy.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.700]   So I think it different things for different people, right?
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.700]   - Absolutely.
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.380]   - So that brings me to a question of when,
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.380]   when something feels creatively right
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.540]   and you're sensing it and you're there,
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.540]   let's say in the studio,
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.920]   or maybe even you're listening to something
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.060]   that somebody sent you,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.980]   how do you translate that?
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.580]   Given the absence of language,
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.180]   how do you translate that into a conversation
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.220]   with the artist?
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.340]   And again, this could be about writing or comedy or,
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.800]   you know, or science or podcasting for that matter.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.340]   How do you say that,
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.780]   keep going that way when they might not even recognize
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.620]   that they did it.
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.980]   And I'm guessing a lot of times they don't.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.020]   - Yeah, sometimes they don't.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.060]   It depends when we're in the,
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:50.220]   I'll try to be in a setting where as we're talking about it,
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.940]   we can engage with it in that moment.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.680]   So it's not much good.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.340]   Let's say I was producing your new record
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.220]   and you played me something and I had some thoughts
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.300]   about it.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.460]   It wouldn't be so helpful for me to tell you
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.660]   what those were.
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.520]   It'd be better for us to wait till we were in a place
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.340]   where we could try things and see where it goes.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.340]   So the first thing is I wouldn't rely on language to do it.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.580]   It would be more of a,
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.580]   making a suggestion of something that's actionable.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.820]   We try it and then we have more data
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.780]   and either we're moving in a good direction
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.060]   or we're moving away from it.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.060]   We're moving towards it or away from it.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.380]   And we never know.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.060]   And so it's always an experiment.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.560]   And maybe a simple way to talk about it would be like,
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.560]   if I gave you two dishes of food and asked you to taste them
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.620]   and tell me which one you like better.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.380]   It's pretty, usually it's pretty straightforward.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.140]   You know, when you have two choices, which you like better.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.140]   And I think most creativity can be boiled down to that.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.100]   That's very different than I wonder how this is gonna
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.020]   perform on certain social media platforms.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.660]   That's different than what is it when I'm tasting
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.940]   these two things, which is the one I wanna finish eating.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.180]   And if I would say, hmm, I like this one better,
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.420]   but it needs a little salt and then put a little salt on.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.660]   And it's like, hmm, maybe I put too much salt.
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.740]   And you know, when you taste it, it's like, it's that simple.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:23.420]   Being in tune enough with ourselves to really know
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.260]   how we feel in the face of knowing that other people
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.460]   might feel very differently, which is part of the challenge.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.460]   It's like, if everyone tells you, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye,
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.020]   and you listen and you're like,
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.180]   "Oh, that's not good."
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.180]   And you say, aye, and you listen and you're like, "That's B."
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:50.460]   As an artist, it's important to be able to say,
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.580]   to me, it's B.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:59.420]   And it's a disconnect because so much of, you know,
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.420]   when we go to school, it's to get us to follow the rules.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:09.300]   And in art, it's different because the rules are there
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:14.300]   as a scaffolding to be chipped away as need be.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.380]   Sometimes they're helpful, sometimes they're not.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.900]   And sometimes we'll even impose our own rules
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.300]   to give something its shape.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.120]   So we can decide to make a, we're gonna make a painting,
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.140]   but we're only gonna use green and red
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.260]   are the only colors we're allowed to use.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.140]   We decide that in advance.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.940]   And then how do we solve the problem
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.740]   knowing all we have is green and red?
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.420]   It can, because otherwise if there's an infinite number
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.940]   of choices, anything can be anything.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.260]   You know, it's like, it's sometimes more choices
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.220]   is not better.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:57.540]   So limiting your palette to something manageable
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:02.280]   forces you to solve problems in a different way.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.980]   Now in our digital age, music wise,
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.980]   you can make anything digitally.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.940]   There's no, like in, there was a time
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.940]   when if you didn't have a guitar in the studio,
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.140]   you couldn't record guitar.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.800]   Or if you didn't, if you couldn't hire an orchestra,
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.560]   there couldn't be orchestra on your recording.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.280]   Now you can just call any of those things up.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.280]   So there's infinite choices and infinite choices
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:36.060]   don't necessarily lead to better compositions
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.700]   or better final works.
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.100]   Understanding how you feel
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:48.720]   in the face of other voices
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.860]   without second guessing yourself
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:55.620]   is probably the single most important thing to practice
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.900]   as an artist or skill set to develop as an artist
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.900]   is to know how you feel and own your feelings.
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.900]   And the key to that is not, I know,
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.720]   so I know what's right for you.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.900]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.360]   It's just, I know from me.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.460]   And the reason I chose to be an artist
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.820]   is to demonstrate this is how I see it.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:26.780]   If I'm undermining my taste for some commercial idea
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:32.460]   or it defeats the whole purpose of doing this.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.380]   This is not, that's not what this process is about.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:40.380]   This process is I'm doing me and I'm showing you who I am
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.980]   and you can like it or not.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.220]   But either way, this is still how I see it.
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.380]   - I love that because in science,
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.660]   having trained graduate students,
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.580]   having been a graduate student,
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.060]   I was very blessed to have mentors.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.420]   One of who was a real icon of class, he's dead now.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.780]   Actually, all my advisors are dead.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.800]   Suicide, cancer, cancer.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.500]   The joke is you don't want me to work for you.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.540]   So they were all had a morbid sense of humor.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.100]   So they're laughing about this someplace right now.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.180]   - I thought you were gonna say
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.220]   they all ate the poison mushrooms.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.240]   - No, but the last one said to me,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.860]   you're the common denominator, Andrew.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.260]   And I thought, oh my goodness.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.460]   And he said, kind of just kidding, but not really.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.280]   So that's a little bit eerie.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:29.280]   But in any case, he always said, his name was Ben.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:34.300]   He always said, the one thing I can't teach is taste.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.260]   And the one predictor I have
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.540]   of the people who will never develop it
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.380]   are the ones who are perfectionists
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:46.100]   because they're perfectionists that filter their perfection
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.540]   through the feedback of others.
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.580]   He was always looking for the person
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.140]   that was putting up a little bit of a middle finger
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.060]   to feedback, not so much that they would get things wrong
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.720]   'cause it can be badly wrong in science.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.140]   It can be wrong for the right reasons,
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.780]   but you can also be for the wrong reasons.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.700]   But people that just had almost a compulsion
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.500]   to do it their way or to believe in what they were doing.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.800]   And I'm hearing some of that
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.020]   or I'm hearing that in what you're describing.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.320]   I also think that there's something
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.440]   about the human empathic process or the emotional process
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.980]   where when we see somebody doing something
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.100]   and they seem to really not be paying attention
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.900]   to what anyone else is doing.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.260]   I mean, like I said, the crazy person on the street
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.440]   is one version of it where we go,
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.980]   they're just in their experience and it's just crazy.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.620]   But when somebody seems to be enjoying themselves
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.000]   or the emotion seems to be real,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.940]   I think there are a good fraction of people
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.140]   who feel a kind of gravitational pull.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.580]   They go, yeah, that.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.980]   And the best example I have of this
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.460]   is I remember growing up in the skateboard thing,
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.500]   we were the first to start doing the baggy,
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.060]   like sagging the clothes thing.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.160]   We got teased endlessly one year in school.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.000]   Then there was a bunch of hip hop that came out
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.140]   and guys were wearing sagging their jeans or their shorts.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.980]   Next year we come back and the very same people
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.220]   who were making fun of us were all doing it.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.460]   And that's when it clicked for me.
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.180]   I was like, most people don't actually know what they like.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.100]   They like what they like because of the certainty
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.540]   of the people that they like.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.540]   And so the question then is in this landscape
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:28.340]   of creative stuff, what's real, what's not real?
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.500]   It's almost like whoever can create
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.280]   the most convincing story at least captures
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.260]   a good fraction of audiences.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.440]   But that's not what the creative artist needs to do.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.940]   They need to actually depart from that.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.880]   Do I have that right?
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.360]   - Well, they're just two different things.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.600]   Like coming up with a story with the purpose
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.740]   of pleasing someone else is a skillset,
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.160]   but it's more of a commercial endeavor
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.740]   than an artistic endeavor.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.820]   - It's like tactical.
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.140]   Yeah, I was seeing it in your book, you describe again,
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.260]   when you're thinking about the creative process
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.220]   as the cloud.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.300]   For me, again, it serves as such a powerful anchor.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.460]   And then I think about the biology, the neurobiology
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:18.460]   of like strategy formation or strategy implementation.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.780]   And then almost by sheer luck or miraculously,
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.740]   I turn a few pages later into the book
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.780]   and there's a description of how animals
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.460]   that are trying to accomplish something,
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:37.460]   eat, mate, find water, accomplish the requirements of living.
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.960]   It requires a narrow visual focus.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.720]   This is something my lab is kind of obsessed with
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.900]   and I've been obsessed with.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.340]   And in that more narrow visual focus,
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:51.180]   we know that the playbook becomes more narrow.
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.860]   The rule set is more narrow.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.180]   Now, at some point in order to come up
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.060]   with a new creative idea,
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.580]   that means that broadening vision is essential in some way
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.840]   or broadening thinking.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.900]   - Well, it could either be a broadening or a narrowing,
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:11.760]   but it's changing the aperture from the standard.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   The reason we do this is to present something new.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.760]   That maybe you already knew, but didn't know you knew it.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:27.920]   And for that to be the case, you have to be looking at it.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.720]   It's not unlike what a comedian does.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.820]   Comedian makes you laugh.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.420]   Usually what they're saying, it's outrageous,
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.920]   but you know that it's right.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.240]   Just no one says it that way
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.380]   or no one has said it that way before.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.060]   But it's always the truth in it that makes it funny.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.280]   It's like that.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   It's the same idea as recognizing something
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.920]   that seems really obvious once you see it,
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.000]   but it seems like nobody else sees it
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.440]   or no one else points it out.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.160]   And I feel like science is like that too,
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.720]   because how much of science,
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   when once the light flashes over your head,
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.840]   it's like, I got it.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.160]   It just seems like, well, we knew that forever.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.680]   No one knew it, but do you know what I'm saying?
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.680]   It's like, it's so obvious.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.580]   It's so obvious.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.720]   And I think another superpower of artists
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.160]   is this accepting we don't know anything.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:30.280]   When we think we know things, that also limits our world.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.000]   We think we know it's only like this.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.880]   This is all that's possible.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.080]   We're mice in this little box.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:43.580]   But in reality, who's to say that's the case?
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.440]   Who's to say any of the,
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.420]   we could take all of the what we believe in science now
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.280]   and decide to throw all of that away and start from scratch.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.540]   And we'd probably create a whole different one.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.920]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.720]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.320]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.120]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.400]   that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.500]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.620]   So that's 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.720]   every single day.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.080]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.920]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.060]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.060]   is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.680]   So whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not,
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.400]   I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   for vitamins, minerals, probiotics,
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.360]   adaptogens to combat stress,
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.000]   and the digestive enzymes really help my digestion.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.540]   I just feel much better when I'm drinking Athletic Greens.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.920]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.760]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.300]   And for the month of January,
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.400]   they have a special offer where they'll give you
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   10 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.520]   Vitamin D3 and K2 are vital for immune function,
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.320]   metabolic function, hormone health,
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.760]   but also calcium regulation and heart health.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.720]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.960]   to claim their special offer in the month of January
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.100]   of 10 free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.460]   - In a offline conversation,
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.560]   one time you asked a good friend of mine
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.640]   who's been a guest on this podcast, Eddie Chang,
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.100]   who's chair of neurosurgery,
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:19.100]   and I would place him in the top 1% of neuroscientists.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.180]   You know, he's pulling speech out of people
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.340]   who are completely paralyzed
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.580]   with Lockton syndrome, et cetera.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:28.100]   And you asked him what percentage of what's contained
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.280]   in medical textbooks and training?
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.380]   - Today. - Today.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.160]   - Yeah, if you went to medical school today
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.940]   and you learned what was in the textbook,
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.300]   what percentage of that information is accurate
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.780]   and what percentage is not?
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.020]   And he said, maybe half.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.880]   - Right, and you asked, and what is the consequence of that?
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.340]   And he said, incalculable.
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:49.220]   And I completely agree.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.380]   And I asked him a second time
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.820]   and he still came up with the same answer.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.440]   So that's a good sign.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.400]   Reliability from experiment to the next is good.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.800]   Yeah, I think that there is this idea
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.800]   that we really know things.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.860]   In science, I mean, you've seen,
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.860]   we've observed amazing discoveries from chance.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:12.220]   We've observed amazing discoveries
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.080]   from incredible bouts of hard work.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.640]   In both cases, people were spending a lot of time in the lab.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.680]   No one walked into the lab, saw something one day,
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.020]   and had a Nobel Prize winning discovery
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.860]   or fundamental discovery.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.780]   They were all hanging out in lab a lot.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.700]   Just some of them came up with something
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.980]   that they didn't expect.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.060]   Others were drilling toward an answer.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.020]   - And in all those cases, when the breakthroughs happen,
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.820]   I'm guessing, I don't know this,
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:43.820]   that considering we assume this information,
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:51.900]   then this discovery is true
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.300]   based on everything that came before it.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.220]   But if everything that came before it is wrong,
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.380]   then the discoveries are probably built on a...
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.220]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.860]   It's like the context, everything that happens
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:09.080]   takes into account that the context that it's sitting in,
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.380]   it fits in that context.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.340]   Maybe that context isn't right, who knows?
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.180]   We don't know.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:18.300]   So I'm saying we're too close to most things
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.700]   in thinking when we think we know things
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:27.340]   where there are a lot of assumptions that go into it
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.220]   and that any new discoveries are essentially built
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.540]   on top of these beliefs, you know?
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.100]   But they're beliefs.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:41.100]   - I remember, of course, I listened to the BC boys
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.100]   growing up, who then I was a child of the '90s
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.180]   and they were in the...
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.540]   Sabotage was sort of an outgrowth of a skateboarding movie
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.900]   like Spike Jones and like the girl movies.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.900]   And those worlds, the BC boys in skateboarding
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.980]   were really closely interwoven for a while.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.300]   Some people know this, some people don't.
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.860]   And Spike sort of formed the bridge
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:00.700]   and then Spike went off
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.300]   and started making more bigger movies.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.120]   And more people watch.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.140]   But let's just use them as an example.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.340]   I heard you say once before that, you know,
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.980]   you guys were kind of joking around like BC boys,
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.180]   like, you know, these guys doing hip hop,
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.860]   but it was kind of like the hardcore scene in New York
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.740]   and punk rock scene.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.700]   And it was sort of a joke.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.540]   There were a lot of inside jokes.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.020]   When you were working together,
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.900]   was there the thought that people might love it,
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.740]   might hate it, or you just weren't paying attention at all?
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.180]   - Weren't paying attention at all.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.020]   Never considered it.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.260]   They would know at that point in time
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.580]   when we were making "Licensed to Ill",
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.740]   hip hop music was a tiny underground thing.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:49.840]   And there was no one making hip hop at that time
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.220]   thought it would ever mean anything.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.780]   It was not a realistic thought.
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.100]   So we were making it really for our crazy friends.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.220]   And that's it.
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.340]   - So do you think nowadays the fact that
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.060]   one can create something and quote unquote,
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:05.900]   release it quickly.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:10.860]   I can put it something out onto Twitter, Instagram now.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.900]   You can do it in 10 seconds from now.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.460]   And I will get immediate feedback that,
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.880]   which is external feedback of course,
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.220]   but then I can iterate on the basis of that feedback.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.340]   Do you think that's problematic
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.380]   for the larger opportunity for creativity?
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.220]   In other words,
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:29.780]   if we were to go back 20 years or even 15 years,
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.600]   when the opportunity to create
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.980]   was certainly still there,
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.540]   but you really didn't know how it was gonna land
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.980]   until you quote unquote released it.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.900]   It seems to me there was more opportunity
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.580]   to stay in that magical rainforest
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.060]   that is the creativity itself.
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.580]   - I don't think it's wrong or right.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.980]   It's just, it's more information that you can use
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.860]   or not use and use it in a useful way.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.180]   And you can make something and put it out
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.260]   and people could not like it.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.820]   And you're like, oop, they still don't get it.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.300]   Here, I'm gonna, I gotta go harder.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.000]   You know, like I gotta go harder in that direction,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.220]   not, do you know what I'm saying?
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.680]   It's like not to react away from information.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:11.680]   It can be helpful.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.180]   It can be helpful when
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.320]   there could be different stories that happen
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.360]   at the same time where you're making something
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.780]   and you have an idea of what it is
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.800]   and then other people engage with it
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.120]   and they have a different idea of what it is
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.060]   and they like it for a different reason than you did
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.340]   or dislike it for a reason different
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.980]   than the reason you like it.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.220]   We can't control any of those things, you know?
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:41.580]   The only part of it that we can control
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.660]   is how we relate to the thing that we make.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:48.740]   And any external information
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.860]   that undermines the clarity of that connection
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.080]   is probably bad for the art, is my guess.
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.500]   And again, I'm only saying this from my experience.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.740]   Like I try to make things,
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:07.800]   all I've ever tried to make was something I like
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.900]   or something that I felt like was missing as a fan
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.660]   that I wanted and nobody was making it.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.040]   So I'll make it, you know, but it wasn't.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:23.340]   It was always in the service of, I love this thing.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.700]   I want something like this.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.020]   No one else is making one.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:26.980]   I have to make one.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:31.260]   - Yeah, it's beautiful 'cause the word
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.420]   that keeps coming to mind is this,
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.220]   it's almost like a compulsion.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.700]   Like there are other options of ways to be
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.180]   and to behave and to function and work and life,
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.240]   but if something's a compulsion,
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.540]   it yanks us away from those other opportunities
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.620]   just enough that we have to get back to it.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:52.080]   You've talked before about, and you talk in the book,
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.780]   this notion of the source.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:59.060]   And to me, again, I can't help but put my neuroscientist
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.420]   lens on this.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:05.020]   I think of the source as not one brain area,
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:09.180]   but some function within the brain where we are in touch
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.700]   with our bodily signals, like what feels right,
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.700]   what doesn't, sort of like tasting the two foods.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.880]   I love that example.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:22.600]   And that it's a playbook that is far more vast
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.100]   than the short-term adaptive playbook.
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.540]   Like this is how I'm going to get from point A to point B.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.860]   And yet, when I listen to an album or a song,
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.280]   I mean, I have to assume that at some point,
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:40.280]   it becomes not strategy development or creativity,
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.300]   but strategy implementation.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.100]   Like there needs to be songs are going to come in this order
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.140]   and like, I don't know much about music.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.700]   My musician friends are always laughing.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.780]   - I don't either, it's not so much about music.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.580]   I don't know that, right, well put.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:01.280]   But the ordering of the sequence of the melodies, et cetera.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.280]   So at what point does one decide, okay,
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.020]   like now's the time to get into that more narrow focus
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:13.940]   of effort, like we've got it, let's run with this.
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.940]   Because there is a component of the creative process
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:17.740]   that involves packaging and finishing.
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:21.400]   Is that part less satisfying to you
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.820]   or is it just all part of the same larger arc?
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.820]   - It's all part of the same, it's nice.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:26.780]   There's a good feeling.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.380]   There's usually a good feeling when something is done.
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:34.380]   On the one hand, it's a commitment
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.840]   because up until the time that you say it's done,
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.760]   you can keep experimenting and changing it.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.820]   If you think, well, maybe tomorrow I can make it better,
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.860]   then it's not finished.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.740]   And you keep thinking that for a long time,
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.780]   you can do that forever and never put out anything.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:53.780]   So getting to the point where you're ready to sign off
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.540]   is a good feeling and it allows you,
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.260]   one of the things I talk about in the book is,
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.160]   because it is a difficult thing to do,
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.660]   'cause it's fun to play and it's fun to,
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.560]   maybe it's not the best it could be yet.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:13.580]   To use whatever the next project is gonna be
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:18.580]   as motivation to finish the one you're working on now.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.100]   Like, I'm working on this,
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.920]   I'm spending all of my time on this thing.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.720]   It's really good, I believe it can be better,
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.240]   but there's this other thing that I really wanna make.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.780]   And if I keep tinkering with this one,
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.900]   I'll never get to make the other one.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.900]   So using other projects as a impetus to finish something
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:43.240]   and release it into the world's a good one.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.380]   And you said your description of source
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:51.380]   as something within us, I don't know if I would say
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.460]   that was accurate.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:59.460]   It's definitely in us too, but it's not only in us.
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:03.420]   And it's, I think of source
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.340]   as the organizing principle of everything.
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:13.260]   And it's how everything exists,
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:17.840]   how the trees grow and why there are mountains
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.140]   and anything that we can see in the outside world
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:25.640]   and every discovery and every piece of art
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   and every new design and every machine
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.220]   are all outgrowths of this source energy.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:39.180]   Our part of it is the antenna that like connects to it.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:44.180]   And maybe we're the vehicle for source
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:50.160]   to allow things to happen in the world.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:55.300]   - And thank you for that 'cause I did indeed misspeak
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.460]   because I recall very distinctly in the book,
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.940]   you described how the physical world is constrained
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.960]   by the laws of physics and certain things.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.300]   The imagination is unconstrained.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.500]   And I think I have this right that you said,
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.920]   the work sits somewhere between those.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.800]   It's neither of one nor the other,
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.720]   that ultimately what feeds into all of that,
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.240]   our imagination and the way indeed
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:20.280]   that our brain is a physical entity,
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.100]   the nature and the outside world provides
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.840]   at least what appears to be near infinite,
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.200]   if not infinite options.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.960]   And I love the example of the color palette
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.460]   that if we restrict me to whatever sorts of paints
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:36.200]   or medium I have, then it's restricted.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.800]   But in nature, there's an infinite number of shades
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.540]   and tones and combinations.
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.460]   - And even on one, if you pick up a rock
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.480]   and look at the color of the rock
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.760]   and tried to find a paint to match that rock,
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.100]   it would never match.
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:55.100]   There's too much, there are too many variations in nature
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:47:01.380]   within a single color rock for us to get close.
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:05.140]   There's too much information.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.600]   We scratch the surface.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.640]   We're only scratching the surface.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.200]   - And we love when we are able to peer in
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.040]   at different scales, spatial scales,
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.960]   time scales too, but spatial scales,
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.200]   the delight that comes from that,
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.440]   you know, that these nature pictures
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.720]   seem like there were more of these in the 80s,
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.840]   like where you'd see a drop of oil shot
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.720]   at high, very high resolution.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.800]   There's beauty in a drop of oil.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.760]   And then you'd see that the earth and the galaxy,
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.120]   there's beauty in that too, right?
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:31.440]   These extremes.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.920]   And of course our daily perception
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.460]   is mostly through the filter
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.920]   of these kinds of interactions, walls,
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.860]   and sometimes outdoors.
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:42.660]   There's a brilliant neuroscientist
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.100]   and not surprisingly, he has a Nobel.
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.200]   His name is Richard Axel.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.660]   He's at Columbia University.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:51.780]   He's outrageous personality.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.680]   Choose Nicorette nonstop.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.760]   You guys would get along great,
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:56.820]   not because of the Nicorette,
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.460]   but because his perspective on things
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:04.460]   is very abstract for a guy who's solved,
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:07.960]   he won the Nobel for solving a great problem
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:12.880]   within how we smell, perception of odors and tastes.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.460]   And he says, you know,
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.860]   everything that the brain does is an abstraction.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.580]   Like I could take a photograph of your face
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.420]   and show it to you and say, yeah, that's me.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.680]   Or let's say for the moment,
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.100]   I call myself an abstract artist.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.020]   Let's just play a game
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.020]   'cause I've never been accused of being an artist,
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.760]   but, and I do three dots and a squiggly line.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.060]   And I say, that's you.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.340]   And you say, well, that doesn't look like me.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.660]   And I say, but that's my abstraction of you.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.380]   Okay, well, the brain essentially does that
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.500]   because we're something in between that
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.140]   because there's no actual photograph of you in my brain.
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.740]   It's just a bunch of neurons playing
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.340]   what we call an ensemble,
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.840]   like a different keys on a piano.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.620]   And we go, Rick, I recognize you, Rick Rubin.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.820]   And so everything is an abstraction.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.080]   And it's only once we start tinkering with the parts,
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.300]   and this is the essence of science
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.340]   to remove and add and manipulate.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:02.220]   And the best example I can come up with would be Rothko.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.800]   And I only come up with this example
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.280]   'cause I started off in vision science
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.160]   and maybe this will make the most sense to everyone,
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.700]   except the folks who've been blind since birth.
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:12.160]   And they can swap something in here.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.780]   If I show you a Rothko and I don't tell you it's a Rothko,
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:18.040]   you may or may not actually think it's that impressive.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.520]   It depends on your taste in art.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.720]   But what Rothko did, which was amazing,
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.200]   even if you don't like Rothkos, and I happen to,
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:31.160]   is that he removed all the white and high contrasty stuff.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.120]   And when you do that, you alter color space.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.760]   And so the colors look very different.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.660]   Some people saw that dress a few years ago.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:41.420]   Is it orange or is it gold or whatever?
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.220]   That was a little bit of the same phenomenon.
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.920]   I doubt, in fact, I'd be willing to bet my left arm
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.280]   that Rothko knew nothing about
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.640]   the neuroscience of color perception,
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.260]   but somehow got to this place
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.780]   where if there was no canvas showing and no high contrast,
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.680]   and the paintings were large enough,
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.400]   and on the appropriate wall, you saw them a certain way
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.320]   that tapped into something fundamental.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.000]   And this is where I think art and science really converge,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.540]   is that every once in a while,
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:15.180]   we see something that feels amazing to enough people,
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.740]   and not just like the baggy pants phenomenon,
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.280]   not just because other people think it's cool,
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.800]   but there's something there.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.760]   And again, this defies language.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.540]   And I have to imagine that in your years of light
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:31.160]   and music and other creative endeavors,
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.860]   that you've, that every once in a while,
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.980]   have you ever encountered something where like,
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.340]   something fundamental keeps showing up in different form,
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:45.240]   or there's something almost like a rule or a principle?
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.720]   Does it ever come about?
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.400]   'Cause in science, we think of this as like,
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.520]   this reveals something about our limitation
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.640]   to abstract the world.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.480]   I hope I made that clear.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.240]   - Not exactly, but I have a thought.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:03.320]   You talked earlier about the drop of oil,
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.780]   the photograph of the drop of oil,
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:08.600]   and the photograph of, or we could use on the other side,
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:12.040]   like Hubble telescope images of these vast things
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.720]   in high definition.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.600]   What we see every day is as impressive as those things,
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.820]   but we're numb to them,
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:22.680]   because we see them all the time.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.480]   And if we were to look at drops of oil every day
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:29.820]   in a microscope, a month from now,
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.000]   we would not find wonder in that image.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   So it's, sometimes it's the novelty
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.280]   of not seeing it from that perspective before.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.840]   That's really thrilling.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.520]   You could, and I could imagine,
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.980]   and this probably relates to the Rothko idea,
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:54.040]   that you could see something from a particular angle
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:57.000]   and have this magical experience,
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.600]   and then walk three feet to the side
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.680]   and see it from a different way, and it just evaporates.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:06.680]   It only works, it only triggers this thing in us
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.720]   when we look at it just the right way.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:16.320]   There was an experiment I just heard about,
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.440]   heard about the other day that sounds fascinating,
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.700]   that a painting teacher recommended,
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:26.420]   where instead of painting,
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.500]   having a model in the room and painting the model,
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.900]   that you have the model in the next room,
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:35.340]   and you go into the next room without your equipment,
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.940]   you don't have your equipment,
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.540]   and you can study the model for as long as you want,
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.820]   and then you go into a different room
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.360]   where you can't see the model and paint the model.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.360]   Instead of, and it changes your relationship
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:54.940]   where it's not, we're not just painting the lines.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:59.940]   We're painting what is interesting enough about what I saw,
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:05.300]   what are the data points that stuck in my mind,
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:09.200]   and when I string those together, what do I get?
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:13.900]   And what do I, how do I form it
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:16.240]   to get as close to whatever that,
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.660]   the experience of that person was,
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:23.660]   which the closest of getting to the experience
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.380]   of that person in the painting
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.820]   might not look like a photograph.
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:34.460]   You know, it might look more different
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:40.800]   than more the same to really see what you see.
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.540]   If we think about the Picasso paintings
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.460]   that were inspired by African art,
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.460]   where the eyes are on different levels,
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:54.740]   they may give us more information
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.340]   than a photograph would give us.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:54:00.940]   I'm thinking about the,
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:05.500]   when you were describing the sensation
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.420]   of when something takes your breath away,
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:11.660]   and we all have that when we see a dramatic sunset.
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:14.220]   Anyone you know, when there's a really dramatic sunset,
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.180]   or if there's a whale,
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:19.700]   and if anyone's on the beach and there's a whale,
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.640]   everybody's really interested that there's a whale.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.420]   It's, do you know what I'm saying?
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.380]   These feelings of wonder,
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:30.780]   we get to experience them depending on where we are,
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:35.100]   or a dragonfly, or a bird flies into your space.
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.260]   These things happen, and when they happen,
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:42.260]   like we're confronted with the mystery of the world
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.780]   when we change the perspective.
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.300]   Normally we don't think of whales in our backyard,
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.180]   or birds in our house, flying freely.
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:54.640]   But they do happen, these things do happen.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:58.880]   And they like break us out of our trance
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.620]   when these things happen.
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:04.460]   It's like, oh yeah, there are birds like this everywhere.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.180]   I'm just not paying attention.
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.660]   This guy's coming in to like tap me on the shoulder.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:09.500]   It's like, remember me?
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.540]   Here I am, you know?
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:14.100]   - So I would say that the whale example
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:17.060]   and what you're describing is it's revealing to us
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:20.060]   how in a delightful way,
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.580]   how deficient our perceptual filters normally are.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.620]   It's a little bit like the Rothko is revealing how,
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.860]   I've never thought about it this way until this moment,
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:33.220]   is revealing to us how color normally looks is actually,
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.380]   first of all, not the only way it looks.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:36.780]   Those colors we think are one way,
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.700]   but all color, this gets into the biology of color vision,
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:40.940]   is all about contrast.
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:43.700]   What something is next to dictates what it looks like.
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.740]   And that's the origin of that dress meme
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.300]   or whatever you call it.
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.260]   I still can't figure out exactly what a meme is.
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.860]   Someone will eventually tell me.
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:56.460]   In the same way, when you see a whale and it's delightful,
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.160]   I think it's revealing to us the extent
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.940]   to which those whales are, the ocean is vast.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.260]   There's a whole universe there
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.920]   and we are blind to it all the time.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:08.260]   And I think the misperception or the misconception,
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.760]   excuse me, is that we're delighted 'cause we see the whale.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.040]   We might be just as delighted
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.700]   because we're getting hit with the contrast
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:18.020]   of how little we recognize all the time.
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.860]   And in that way, it reminds me a little bit about comedy
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:24.960]   where, and I've been watching more comedy lately
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.280]   and sometimes it's the shock.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:32.280]   Sometimes it's the absolute truth that's revealed.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.940]   And then other times, what I've noticed,
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:40.940]   and I saw Rogan do comedy at the Vulcan Club in Austin,
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.380]   which he does every once in a while,
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:47.380]   and it was a small club and he was leading out the story
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.820]   during his routine or bit, I think, right?
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:54.300]   This bit, his lead, and everyone knew where it was going.
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.680]   We all knew.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:59.640]   And then when he finally told us,
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.180]   it was exactly where we thought it was going.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.680]   And it was hilarious.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.520]   - And it felt good.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.840]   - And it felt amazing.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.460]   And I thought in that moment, I was like, wait a second,
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:09.780]   how did he pull that off?
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:12.280]   That was masterful because normally it's this thing
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.540]   like you create one story, there's like a scripting out,
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:15.900]   almost like a courtroom lawyer,
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.180]   and then they kind of pull the curtain
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:18.740]   and it's something different.
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.620]   And if you look at the science, the neuroscience
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.380]   and brain imaging of laughter and humor,
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.340]   which I've looked into, to be honest,
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:27.940]   and no disrespect to the people in that field,
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:29.540]   it's pretty lame.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:33.940]   It's lame because it's always the jarring nature
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.440]   of a surprise.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.380]   But what he led us to was something that, oh no,
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:39.780]   he's actually going there.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:41.000]   Oh wait, he's really going there.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.660]   And it was this anticipation
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.900]   with a beautiful delivery at the end.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:50.020]   And so I'm convinced that based on what we're talking
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:51.900]   about here, that there's something about
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:54.380]   when we see something, we think it's about that,
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:56.900]   but that the delight that we feel could be
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:00.180]   about all the other experiences that now become
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:03.940]   in a subconscious way, kind of like, ha,
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.060]   it's almost like laughing at this perceptual deficit
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:07.900]   that we have.
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.380]   It's almost like laughing at how little we actually know,
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.020]   which is what you've said.
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:16.740]   - Yeah, it could be that it also could be the sense
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:21.740]   of community of when you think it's going to go
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:23.940]   a particular way and it goes that way,
[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:28.140]   it's like reinforcement of you.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:32.860]   You know, it's like, yeah, he's saying it,
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:34.860]   but in a way we're saying it together.
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:38.260]   I'm listening, he's saying it, but we're in this together.
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:39.560]   And that's a good feeling.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.620]   - To think about that for a second.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:46.780]   I was trying to think about why certain music
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:50.500]   still can evoke such powerful emotions in me.
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.320]   And there does seem to be something special
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.700]   about the music we listen to when we are teenagers.
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:59.520]   You know, from about, you know, 14 until about 25,
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.160]   it seems to get routed into our nervous system in some way,
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.280]   maybe because that phase of our life
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.520]   is really one of identity crisis.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.440]   I mean, you don't find too many 40 year olds,
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:13.140]   some who are wondering like who they are occasionally,
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:15.680]   but almost every young teenager, preteen,
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.120]   and it's kind of like, who am I?
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.700]   You're defining personality.
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.200]   So I always likened it to that,
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.440]   but leaving out the sort of critical period biology stuff,
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:27.240]   what do you think it is about the music
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.280]   that we hear at that time?
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.240]   Are we that much more emotionally tuned?
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.200]   Have we not shut down our sensors quite as much?
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.680]   Is there, the songs and the artists don't matter
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.160]   'cause they're very individual to me.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.860]   For other people it will be the Beatles or something.
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:42.000]   Now I just really wish the Beatles did it for me too.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.360]   But do you think that's important?
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.700]   Because I could see how it's really terrific.
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.960]   I could also see how it sets up one of these,
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.680]   what I'll just use nerdy language to call the,
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.360]   like a semi-deprived filter.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.500]   Because if I'm only looking for the way that,
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.700]   like a stiff little fingers track made me feel
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.920]   the first time I listened to when I was 15,
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.520]   the feeling is worthwhile.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.880]   But if I'm looking for that,
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.340]   I'm missing all the other stuff.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.640]   I'm missing the Beatles, I'm missing Fleetwood Mac,
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.920]   which never did it for me either.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.360]   I'm like, I'm missing all this stuff that, you know,
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.880]   people I love and respect really love.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.760]   So I've never worried about it
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.480]   because there's kind of an infinite treasure trove
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.900]   of other things that I do love.
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.480]   But I do sometimes wonder whether or not
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.080]   my life experiences diminish
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.480]   because I'm not allowing kind of range.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.720]   And you've obviously worked in a huge number
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.600]   of different genres of music.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.760]   Punk is one thing, hip hop is another.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.160]   I mean, Neil Diamond too, right?
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.800]   Eminem too, Slayer too, right?
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.400]   And in some senses I list these off.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.800]   I mean, just think about how much in high school,
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.760]   maybe nowadays less so, but even in college
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.200]   and as an adult, we societally,
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.800]   we're sort of asked to constrain ourselves
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.280]   to one of these groups.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.080]   I didn't know it was okay to love Bob Dylan
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.160]   and love punk rock as much as I do
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.040]   until I heard Tim Armstrong said he loved Bob Dylan.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.280]   And I was like, and recently he told me
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.760]   he loves the Grateful Dead.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.300]   And I was like, whoa.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.120]   But I remember when you had to pick.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.320]   Both the Ramones and the Clash loved the Beatles.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.160]   So we can--
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.440]   - Okay, I got work to do.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.160]   - No, but we'll do it together.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.120]   - Okay, so--
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.160]   - I have a feeling part of it is
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.760]   the reason it gets in at that age
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.720]   is it's at a time when we're defining who we are
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.720]   and the music is part of the definition
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.400]   of how we see ourselves.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.740]   So it's like the music that we hear before that
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.200]   might be the music that's on the radio
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.640]   or our parents' music or our older brother or sister's music.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.840]   And then when you're 14 or 15
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.200]   and you start choosing what you're listening to,
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.400]   it's like, now it's finally mine.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.080]   And my parents might not like it
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.700]   and my older brothers and sisters may or may not like it,
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.760]   but this one is mine.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.760]   And it always has that
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:10.760]   impression in us that this is ours.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.760]   That's my thought of why it continues to last, you know?
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.360]   - How do you wipe the slate clean then?
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.880]   So for instance, if you're going to go in
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.360]   and work with somebody new,
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.600]   and again, as people are hearing this,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.080]   I hope that they're transplanting this
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.400]   to whatever it is that they do.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.640]   'Cause in the realm of science
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.980]   and podcasting communication, it's not music,
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:34.000]   but there's a contour and a way,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.220]   hopefully this podcast will look nothing
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.620]   like it does in five years.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.260]   That's my hope is it will still have the core features
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.760]   of the beauty and utility of biology coming through,
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.240]   but I hope it doesn't look anything like episode two.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.140]   - And I think it'll evolve as you evolve.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.240]   It's just the truer it is to what interests you.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.280]   And if you're not interested in biology
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.440]   in the same way in five years,
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.200]   I would hope it's not the same.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.400]   - I'll be doing psychoanalysis in real time here.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.480]   We'll do therapy, we'll all be lying down on couches.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.820]   - Whatever it is, whatever it is.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.640]   - Yeah, we probably won't be on psychedelics,
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.440]   but we might be levitating, you know?
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.640]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.760]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.220]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.740]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.380]   to help you better understand your body
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.220]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.880]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.300]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.320]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.920]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.960]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.520]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.040]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.800]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.560]   InsideTracker solves that problem
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.900]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:48.920]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.760]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.920]   you might want to take on
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.500]   in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.280]   hormones, lipids, and other things
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.240]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.520]   to bring those numbers into the ranges
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.140]   that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.520]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.080]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.860]   - So how do you, let's talk a little bit, if you would,
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:23.600]   'cause I know I'm very interested in your process, right?
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.360]   I'll spare you the daily routine question.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.000]   It's very cliche, but you and I
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.340]   are both lovers of sunlight, of horizons,
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.480]   and not as a trivial source,
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.480]   as an amazing gift of energy, right?
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.320]   And there aren't words for it, really.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.140]   Aside from your daily routines,
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:51.120]   when it comes to, you know, somebody,
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.720]   you're going from project to project
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.520]   and you know you're going to be doing work with somebody,
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.360]   could be your own work,
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.680]   and we'll talk about the writing of this book
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.600]   and its structure, which is very unique.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.760]   I've never encountered a book
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.540]   with this kind of structure before.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:06.240]   And it's the most facile read ever,
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.960]   and yet every single page, I underlined, took note, starred,
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.700]   and like, as you'd notice, it's very worn,
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.740]   very, very worn already, and only more so over time.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:22.880]   Do you have a process for removing the functions of the day
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:27.420]   and what you were doing last week and what's going on,
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:31.680]   and in order to get more access
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.240]   to this, I'm going to think of it now
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.100]   more as a receiver inside of you, right?
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.520]   Almost like tuning a radio,
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.640]   and then it comes in.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.180]   Like the beginning of like a Strummer Clash thing, right?
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.980]   You love the radio, Joe loved the radio, right?
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.380]   And then it comes in clear, and there it is.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.300]   How do you clear the static?
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:54.000]   What are some of the operational steps
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.540]   that you think might be more generalizable
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:03.540]   to regardless of where somebody in Africa's listening to this?
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:07.020]   - I would say when I engage in a particular project,
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:11.480]   whatever it is, I dedicate all of myself
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:15.600]   for that period of time, whatever it is,
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.780]   whether it be 20 minutes or whether it be five hours,
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:24.780]   whatever it is, total focus and no outside destruction.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:29.780]   And no outside distraction whatsoever.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:33.620]   And when I leave that process,
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:36.700]   I do my best not to think about it when I'm away from it.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.100]   I don't bring any materials with me.
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.900]   I don't leave the studio with works in progress
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:44.180]   and spend time listening to them during the day
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:45.900]   or looking for ideas.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.740]   I stay as far away from it
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:53.260]   when I'm not directly engaging in it as possible.
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.300]   And in the best of situations,
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:00.420]   I have something else to totally engage myself in in between.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:04.520]   So instead of working on project A for five hours
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.780]   and then leaving and doing nothing,
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:11.420]   I'm hoping to engage in a project B or B, C, and D
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:15.180]   with all of myself before going back to project A again,
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.380]   which might be the next day, let's say.
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:21.380]   - So this relates to an amazing chapter
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.620]   and series of writings in your book
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:23.640]   that I'm not going to describe
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.740]   because I want people to find it for themselves
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:29.140]   about disengaging, about disengaging from the process.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.180]   One question I had as I read that chapter,
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.220]   and as you're saying this now,
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.380]   is even though you're disengaged,
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.620]   do you believe that your subconscious is working it through?
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.520]   - I believe so. I believe so.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:45.140]   And I think in general to stew over a problem
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:47.380]   is not the way to solve a problem.
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:51.800]   Think to hold the problems lightly.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:56.740]   And when I say a problem, when we're starting a project,
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:01.740]   there's usually this feeling of there's a question mark
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.460]   at the beginning of every project.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.820]   I'm always anxious when I start a new project
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.900]   because I have no idea what's going to happen.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:09.900]   I never know.
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:14.900]   I never, I may have in some cases a potential backup plan
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:23.300]   if nothing works, but I really try not even to have that.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.960]   I prefer not to have that.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.360]   I prefer to go in, maybe to calm myself down enough
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.780]   to be able to show up.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:35.400]   There'll be an idea of like, nothing works.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.240]   Maybe we could try something like this,
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.580]   but that would only be for my own anxiety.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:43.820]   That wouldn't be for actual practical use.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:46.420]   But there's always a sense of anxiety
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.500]   because I know whatever's going to happen
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.100]   is completely out of my control.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:57.820]   Something either interesting or not will appear.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:00.580]   And then we're going to follow that wherever it goes.
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:06.480]   And until something appears for us to follow,
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:11.820]   I have a lot of anxiety.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.980]   Even though it has never not come,
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.460]   you know, it has come every time,
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.040]   but there's something about it.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.380]   'Cause I also feel like there might be expectation on me
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.440]   that I'm going to make it happen.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.860]   And I know that's not happening.
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:25.340]   That's not how it works.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:30.340]   It's, I show up ready for it to happen
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:38.060]   and I'm open to whatever we have to do
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:40.700]   to find that first thread.
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.220]   And once we find the thread, then it's like, okay,
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.420]   we have a, and that thread may lead us to anything,
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.540]   you know, can lead us to in a million different directions,
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.660]   but something about having that glimmer,
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:55.700]   that it's not a, we're not looking at a blank page.
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:59.000]   You know, we're looking at, okay, we have a,
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.260]   we have the beginnings of, I would say a map,
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:09.000]   but it's a map that we don't know where it takes us.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.260]   And it's just the beginning.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:14.860]   It's just like, it's just the start, you know, you are here.
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.940]   If you have a map and it says you are here,
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:20.980]   even if you can't see the directions,
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:22.960]   knowing where we are feels okay.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:28.740]   And once we get, and usually, again,
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:33.380]   usually in the first day, first couple of days, it happens.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:41.340]   But up until then, it's really an anxiety producing situation.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:44.320]   And then I can't remember the original question.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.620]   It's like, that was the beginning
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.780]   of something completely different,
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.360]   but do you remember what you asked?
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.200]   I don't remember.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.580]   - Yeah, well, we were talking about disengaging
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.180]   and as your subconscious into it,
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:57.180]   and then we were talking about, you know,
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:00.420]   so I love this sort of like, what is your process
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:03.980]   of wading into this thing and you're revealing that now?
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.700]   I mean, I think of anxiety as readiness, you know?
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:11.000]   I mean, think about the characteristic features of anxiety.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.560]   It tends to be a bit of a constriction of the visual field
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.960]   into more of a narrow vision, but that's appropriate
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.340]   because you want to shed what's going on elsewhere.
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.320]   And then, you know, even when people talk about the shakes
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.260]   or this like not feeling okay sitting still,
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.540]   anxiety was designed to mobilize us
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.240]   and not always to run away.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.100]   This is one of the, I could, you know,
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.920]   rarely do I talk about the work in my own laboratory,
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.420]   but one of the things that frankly, I didn't discover,
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.620]   but it was done in my laboratory,
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.820]   but this brilliant graduate student, Lindsay Soleil,
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:45.740]   who's now at Caltech, was that we can often observe animals
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:48.360]   or humans in very high states of anxiety
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.620]   as they move forward toward a goal.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.000]   And we always think of moving forward
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.320]   as like this calm thing, you know, these heroes,
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.820]   you know, Rosa Parks telling people like, F you,
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.740]   like I'm not getting off the back,
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.220]   I'm not leaving the, giving up my seat on the bus
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.180]   or Muhammad Ali, I bet you
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:07.020]   they were experiencing tremendous anxiety,
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:09.180]   but it was in the forward tilt.
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:14.100]   And so I think anxiety is least comfortable
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.740]   when we are forcing ourselves to stand still.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.260]   So it's an activating energy.
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.760]   And, you know, that brings up a word that, you know,
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.200]   I have written in my notebook as an extraction
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.780]   of a lot of themes from within the book
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.140]   that you and I have talked about before,
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:31.920]   which is, and here I'm going to sound very West Coast woo,
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.920]   but I mean it as seriously as it can be stated
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.540]   that I feel like everything is energetic.
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:44.760]   We can do things from a place of anger.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.540]   We can do things from a place of joy.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.580]   We can do things from a place of delight.
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:53.100]   I like to think maturing into the idea
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.060]   that joy and delight and love
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:58.180]   is kind of the ultimate reservoir of energy.
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:00.700]   But, you know, a lot of the music I liked
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.560]   from when I was younger was because of the anger
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.880]   that was thread into it or the sadness.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.420]   - If you think of your relationship to that music,
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.660]   it's a relationship of love.
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.800]   You didn't listen to that to get angry.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.720]   You listened to it because you loved it.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.080]   - And I felt loved by it because it matched
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:18.920]   where I was at at the time.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.180]   - Yes, it was true to who you were and where you were.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.520]   - I know that collaboration,
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.900]   there's a wonderful chapter on collaboration,
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.920]   but it's collaboration as you mentioned before
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.480]   with the universe, not with others,
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.180]   but in terms of the,
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:35.340]   especially the kind of work that you've done and do,
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:39.620]   when it comes to working with artists, I do wonder,
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:43.060]   and here I'm not looking for any gossip or stories.
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.540]   I've never been interested in gossip.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.080]   I love stories, but I'm not interested in gossip.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:51.740]   But once you see that thread kind of dangling there
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.820]   and you guys are going to go after this
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:55.200]   or you grab onto it and you're like,
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.740]   okay, now you have a little bit of a map
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.380]   and an orientation within that map.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:03.000]   I often wonder, scientists are complicated people.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.160]   People think they're very boring,
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.580]   but they're actually very complicated
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:08.780]   because they're often living in one limited rule set
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:09.740]   of the prefrontal cortex.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:12.020]   That's how you get good at getting degrees
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.560]   is by understanding the rules of academia
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.020]   and playing by those rules.
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:18.360]   People tinker with the rules.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.680]   You get your Richard Axles who are very playful
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.240]   in how they go about it, but they are systematic.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.920]   He's known for rigor, rigor, rigor, right?
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.100]   When I think of creative artists and musical artists,
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.140]   I think of a bit more zany or loose
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:35.120]   or you watch the documentary about the Ramones
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.320]   and you're like, wow, there's all this chaos.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.560]   How, because so many of the brilliant artists,
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.780]   musical artists that are out there
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.920]   seem to have some chaos inside them
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.620]   or their lives aren't always structured.
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:49.400]   Oftentimes, and science too, by the way,
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.880]   there are substance abuse issues and personal life issues.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.480]   How, since you don't have 100% control,
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:59.840]   they need to play the instruments, sing, et cetera.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:04.840]   How do you work with people who have it in them,
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.980]   but are getting in their own way, right?
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:13.680]   And do you think that that kind of the internal chaos
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.220]   that a lot of artists seem to have,
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:20.080]   do you think that sometimes is actually an essential piece
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.680]   of the creativity picture, that you can't disentangle it?
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.080]   - Yeah, I don't think it's an essential piece in general,
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.440]   but certain artists, that's how they do it.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:36.720]   I would say I rarely get to see the chaotic part of artists.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.600]   For whatever reason, they rarely show it to me.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.440]   And most of them, like most comedians I know,
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.640]   are much more serious about what they're doing
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:49.640]   than what it looks like from, if you see them on stage.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.480]   There's much more to it and there's much more focus
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.280]   on craft going on and digging deep
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.760]   than would necessarily be obvious,
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.360]   seeing them jump around on stage.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.680]   - Yeah, I'm a fan of boxing, track and field and boxing,
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.300]   the sports nobody really cares about,
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:13.540]   now that UFC is so popular and track and field is a,
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.240]   it's a little bit like wrestling when you go,
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.440]   the people that are there 'cause they really love it.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.420]   We'll talk about wrestling in a little bit,
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:20.520]   professional wrestling.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.980]   But Floyd Mayweather's obviously a colorful character
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:28.720]   and one of the best records in boxing of all time.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.600]   And a few years back, I got into watching his stuff
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.000]   and what one sees is the cars and the money,
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.360]   they literally call themselves the money team,
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.400]   and the spending and there's all the outrageous stuff.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.620]   But I know someone who is in camp with him,
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:47.560]   who actually was a sparring partner for him
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.600]   and the lore has it,
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.760]   they have very closed door sparring or cleanups,
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.160]   but the lore is that he would do,
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.300]   'cause nowadays it's 12, three minute rounds,
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.160]   with a minute in between, used to be 15,
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.080]   but now neuroscientists stepped in
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.820]   and it turns out a lot of the deaths were occurring
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.320]   when it was more than 12 rounds.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.600]   For whatever reason, it cut off at 12,
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.040]   really seemed to truncate the deaths.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.280]   There are other things too,
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.320]   if the dad is apparently a corner man,
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.520]   we have someone else here at the podcast
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.360]   who knows more about this than me.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.280]   - That's fascinating.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.640]   - Yeah, the kid not wanting to disappoint the parent,
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.240]   correlated with death, I'll get some of this wrong
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.600]   and then they can come after me.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:26.480]   But in any case, this guy who was in Floyd's camp
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.760]   said that he would do 30 to 60 minutes of sparring,
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.140]   bringing in fresh sparring partners with no rest,
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:36.760]   that he would run three or four times per 24 hour cycle,
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.960]   despite all the critical need for sleep,
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.040]   that his training was unbelievably intense,
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:45.920]   to the point where he would just chew up
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.980]   and destroy all training partners.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:53.060]   And yet the perception that we see is it's playful for him.
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.120]   So it sounds very similar,
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:57.260]   like what we see is often not what goes into it,
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:59.660]   that people are intensely rigorous.
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:01.520]   - Yeah, and I think in a way,
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.760]   from a psychological perspective,
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.120]   if you knew you were fighting someone
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.020]   who wasn't taking it seriously,
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:12.280]   that would give you some confidence
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.060]   and that would not be a good thing
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:19.060]   if the person was actually working really hard,
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:22.440]   outworking you, do you know what I'm saying?
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.920]   Like it's from a psychological perspective
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.880]   that makes sense to me.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.400]   - So what I keep coming back to is that
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.560]   I'm imagining in my mind two ends of the continuum.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.680]   One that is about fairly narrow focus,
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.280]   training, training, strategy, implementation,
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.880]   cultivating craft, building craft.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.360]   And then the other side is this, the cloud.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.700]   It's very nebulous, right?
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:44.520]   And there's this word that I learned
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.240]   from a colleague of mine when I was down
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.600]   at the Salk Institute when my lab was there,
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.420]   'cause he studies this.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:52.880]   There's this phenomenon that I don't want to mispronounce
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.360]   'cause then it sounds like something else.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.960]   But the correct pronunciation is pareidolia.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:03.840]   And pareidolia is our tendency to look at an amorphous shape
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.720]   like a cloud or a tree
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.960]   and think that it looks like something else.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.680]   An ice cream cone.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:11.960]   The man in the moon.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:15.120]   And that again reveals the extent to which
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.080]   the brain wants to place symbolic filters on things.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.260]   And we need this, right?
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:24.780]   Because I see you walk in the door and Rick, I recognize you.
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:27.920]   In fact, we have a brain area called the fusiform face gyrus
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:31.100]   that literally is a face recognition area.
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.400]   And you could be at any orientation
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.120]   or I could just see your eyes and know that it's you.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.180]   There's a phenomenon called proposegnosia
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:40.780]   where people can see faces,
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.740]   they can describe everything in the face,
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:45.060]   but they don't know, for instance,
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:49.660]   that it's JFK or Madonna or Lex Friedman.
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:52.740]   - It's quite the list.
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:53.580]   - Quite the list.
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.560]   There you go, Lex.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.900]   Run for office, Lex.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:57.980]   Just kidding.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:00.780]   It's hard enough to get you to respond to my text as it is.
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:05.920]   So we have these filters and so we're taking this cloud
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.240]   and we're deciding what things are.
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.080]   - Yes.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.900]   - And what I want to go drill into your process
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.300]   a little bit more deeply.
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.660]   When you approach a project,
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:18.400]   so everyone meets each other, shakes hands,
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.940]   here are the engineers, we're going to sit down,
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:22.020]   everyone knows what they're doing
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:25.020]   because you work with professionals and you start going,
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:29.340]   are you trying to be with the cloud or in the implementation?
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.260]   Like where are you in that continuum?
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.980]   And forgive me if I'm like trying to surgically go
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:38.060]   into your process in a way that would disrupt it in any way,
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.560]   but I trust you've been doing this for a while
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.700]   and there's no threat.
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:45.700]   - I'm not, I'm in the cloud with the exception of
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:50.560]   I'm aware of what could go wrong on a technical side
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:54.880]   and I might, like if something good is happening,
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.380]   I might look over and make sure that we're rolling.
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:00.620]   - So that's a leap over to here momentarily,
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:02.640]   but then you're back in the cloud.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.480]   - Maybe.
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:12.700]   If I was in the moment, I would be in the cloud
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:16.300]   and if something good starts happening,
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.300]   it would trigger something in me like,
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:21.260]   oh, I hope this is, I hope we're really doing this
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:23.940]   because I don't know if we could ever do this again.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:28.380]   That would be a thought of when the first time
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.620]   the real world would come into the picture would be
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:36.060]   something good is happening, let's not lose it.
[01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:40.360]   - And when that happens, do you never been in a studio
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.100]   besides a podcast studio?
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:46.460]   Do you say, hey guys, that sounded good, more of that,
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:48.020]   or do you wait, you let them continue?
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.220]   Because obviously you don't want to break their flow.
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:53.600]   - We'd never want to break any flow once it's happening.
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.620]   Yeah, once something's happening,
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:57.780]   just kind of sit back and watch.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.500]   - And do you think there's resonance,
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:02.780]   like the team of engineers and other people know
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:05.020]   when it quote unquote is happening?
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.980]   - If everyone's paying attention, yes.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.120]   When everyone's paying attention,
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.600]   it's usually pretty obvious.
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.540]   Sometimes the thread will be something different
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:15.020]   than expected and maybe not everybody would pick up on it.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:16.880]   And that might be a particular,
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.200]   that might be particular based on my taste
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:24.980]   or an artist's taste or someone involved might say,
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:27.140]   that was, let's listen back to that.
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.080]   I think that was better than what we thought.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:29.920]   That can happen.
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:36.380]   - You said several things and it was like,
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.500]   you said enough for there to be several conversations.
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.980]   - I tend to do that, sorry, especially with you.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.580]   I don't get to see you as nearly as often as I would like.
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:46.060]   And so when I do, I confess that I'm a little bit
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:46.900]   of a kid in a candy shop.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:48.780]   - I wrote down the brain tells us stories.
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:53.420]   So you talked about, I walk in, certain data points,
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:55.360]   you recognize me, but it's a real,
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.860]   like looking at a cloud shorthand.
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:02.860]   We go through our lives doing this all day
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:05.500]   with everything we see.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:11.140]   And the shorthand, in the case of me, you know me,
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:14.820]   the shorthand turns out to be right, it checks out.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:19.060]   If it's something we don't know
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.020]   and something we're not familiar with,
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:26.300]   something happens, we experience something on the street,
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:31.300]   something happens, and it doesn't make sense.
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:33.500]   Something out of the ordinary happens.
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:37.540]   First thing is, this doesn't make sense.
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:42.020]   Then what we do is, again, subconscious, unconsciously,
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:44.100]   I don't know if it's unconscious or subconsciously,
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.660]   without thinking, we create a story
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:51.740]   that explains what just happened, a hypothetical
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:56.620]   that makes it okay that what just happened happened
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:24:01.460]   and oh, maybe he's running 'cause his dog ran away
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:02.540]   and he's chasing his dog.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.420]   Maybe that's why he's running.
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:09.060]   And as soon as we have that thought of what it might be,
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.660]   we relax because now it's not just a guy running
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:13.720]   and this is weird, but it's a guy running,
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.720]   oh, he's probably running after his dog.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:20.720]   And now we register that story
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:24.340]   that we just made up without even knowing
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.340]   we were making it up as what happened.
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:29.420]   And then later in the day, if someone says,
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:30.820]   yeah, do you see that guy running out of bugs?
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:33.000]   Like, yeah, he was chasing his dog, I saw that.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.900]   And you won't even realize
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:37.460]   that it was the maybe hypothetical story
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:42.000]   that was the first possible explanation
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.160]   that allowed you to continue walking.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.940]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.660]   That's our whole lives.
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:51.900]   Our whole lives are reacting to things,
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:54.580]   making up a story of what we think may have happened
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:57.060]   without realizing that's what we're doing
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:58.720]   and then living the rest of our lives
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.420]   as if that thing that we made up really happened
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:03.660]   and we never know.
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:06.460]   - I completely agree.
[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:10.380]   We confabulate from birth until death.
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:13.300]   There's this well-observed phenomenon
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:16.300]   in people who have memory deficits.
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.900]   So there's the sad example of this
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:20.500]   and then there's the everyday, typical, not sad,
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.540]   who knows, sad or not sad example.
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:25.020]   So for instance, if somebody has a slight memory deficit
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.180]   or someone has Alzheimer's dementia,
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:29.540]   they'll find themselves in the hallway at night
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:30.940]   and say, what are you doing here?
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:31.920]   And they'll say, oh, you know,
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.580]   I was going to get a glass of water,
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:35.740]   but they're walking away from the direction
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.700]   that would make sense.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:40.180]   People who, alcoholics who drink enough
[01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:41.780]   develop something called Korsakoff syndrome
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:44.380]   where a certain brain area gets messed up
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.900]   and you'll ask them a question like,
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:46.720]   oh, what are you doing here?
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.280]   And they will come up with incredible stories,
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.360]   sometimes interesting stories
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.660]   that have no bearing on reality.
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:54.900]   You ask them who their name is.
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:55.740]   - But do they believe?
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:56.860]   They believe that's what happened.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.300]   - With 100% certainty.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.580]   And this actually relates to a lot of the
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:04.380]   now better understood controversy around repressed memories.
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:07.020]   You know, you can, especially from young people,
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:09.500]   you can pull memories from them
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.700]   of things that never happened.
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.220]   This has been demonstrated over and over again.
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:14.140]   So courtrooms know to be very cautious now
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.140]   about this whole notion of repressed memories.
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.080]   - That's good to know.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.580]   - Yeah, very, very complicated area of the law,
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:21.960]   as you can imagine,
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.180]   because we tend to want to trust victims
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.140]   for understandable reasons.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.300]   But in terms of accuracy of details,
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.500]   two people have very different accounts
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.400]   of the same experiences.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.740]   And this has been shown over and over again.
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.360]   That you can do well in the laboratory.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.720]   It's pretty interesting.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.740]   So again, because of these selective filtering
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:43.180]   and storytelling, and we are,
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.760]   I think it was Salman Rushdie who said,
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.320]   we are the storytelling species.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.160]   He probably-
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.880]   - Wow, I was going to say we're storytelling machines.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:49.720]   That's great.
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:52.500]   - Yeah, I think, you know, we are the story.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.880]   I would say that the big five,
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:57.220]   if I had to pick up sort of brain function is
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.860]   we are very limited filters.
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:02.660]   The Mantis shrimp sees 67 shades of red
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:04.300]   for every one that we see.
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.740]   So they have access to things we don't have access to.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.800]   They're not, as far as I know, you know,
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.800]   releasing albums of the, you know,
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:14.300]   Red Hot Chili Peppers caliber, but who knows?
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:15.600]   Maybe down there they are.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.840]   I did see something, by the way,
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.520]   as a relevant tangent recently.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:21.440]   And I don't know if it's, look,
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.700]   even if it's crazy, it's super cool.
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:28.640]   If you take a device that amplifies the electrical signals
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:31.700]   coming from Cactus, and you just translate that
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:34.440]   into a simple rule of conversion
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.480]   to two or three pitches of sound,
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.880]   the music that comes out of it is beautiful.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.280]   Nothing short of beautiful.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.100]   And when I saw that, the teenager in me thought,
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.400]   you know, when we hear whale song,
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.380]   we think it's so beautiful.
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:47.200]   Like what if they're just like cursing at each other
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.240]   the whole time, right?
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.560]   I mean, maybe they're in there like a Rogan episode
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.440]   when he invites all his comedian friends in there.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.340]   Who knows?
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:55.360]   Maybe it's a psychoanalytic conversation
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.760]   about their childhood traumas.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.800]   I don't know, but we decide whale song is beautiful.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.040]   We decide Cactus are just plants.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.580]   - And it's beautiful to us.
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:08.920]   And we're right that it is beautiful to us,
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.580]   but it doesn't mean we know anything about it.
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:12.640]   - That's right.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.740]   Yeah, so we have these filters, perceptual filters.
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:18.600]   We only can see and hear, smell and taste what we can.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.860]   And then the brain likes to work in symbols.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:23.940]   We tend to like to match that person
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:27.000]   whose shoes are messed up must be homeless.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.100]   I've had a couple instances in life
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.780]   where I saw what I thought was a homeless vagrant
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:35.140]   inside a building at an academics institution.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:39.180]   It turned out it was the most accomplished person
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.900]   in the field.
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:41.940]   That's always cool.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.440]   Yes, that happened at Berkeley.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.820]   Then the other thing that we do
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:52.160]   is we tend to put symbol,
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.440]   so we said perception, symbol representations,
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.600]   and then our memories are entirely confabulated
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.960]   based on already deficient symbol
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.080]   and perceptual representation.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.380]   And so I never liked the statement
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.880]   that we don't know how the brain works.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.440]   I think we do know how the brain works,
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.140]   but that it works through very limited filters.
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:14.660]   Okay, so knowing that and accepting it,
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:19.660]   and it seems to me that this idea of looking to nature,
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:26.140]   looking outside us is so critical.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:28.540]   And in fact, I hope you won't mind me sharing this,
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:31.820]   but a few years back, I had sent you something by text
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:33.640]   and I was kind of in disbelief
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.540]   about something I'd seen in the media.
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.140]   I was like, they got it all wrong.
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:38.540]   And I knew the person involved
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:41.040]   and it was not a good situation for them.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.660]   And I was like, they got it all wrong.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.960]   And you wrote back and you said,
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:50.600]   "It's all lies, back to nature, the only truth."
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.500]   - Wow, that's wild.
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:54.700]   - And I wrote that down, I put it over my desk.
[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:55.540]   - Wow.
[01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:59.180]   - And I still, you know, I'd tattoo it on my forehead
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:02.580]   if I didn't already have it well, well committed to memory.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:05.740]   But I think I know that's true, right?
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:07.380]   Nature, we can look at and it's-
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.140]   - But when I say it's all lies,
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:12.760]   you just talked about our ability to,
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:17.760]   how limited our facility to see and understand what we see.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.260]   Yes? - Yes.
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:25.260]   - So based on that, that leads us to, we can't know much.
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:28.140]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:32.860]   Our resolution is so low on everything
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:39.540]   that we're really just like, we're grasping at straws.
[01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:43.540]   We have no idea, we have no idea.
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:45.940]   And there's great power in knowing that.
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:48.820]   Because if you think you know what's going on,
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:52.600]   chances are you're being deceived.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.860]   Not because somebody is deceiving you,
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.980]   but because they're telling you what they see
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:30:59.260]   and they don't know.
[01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:00.600]   It's all, do you know what I'm saying?
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:01.780]   It's all made up.
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:05.500]   Everything that we, everything we know is made up.
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.300]   Maybe, maybe it's true.
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:09.020]   This brings us to pro wrestling.
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:14.020]   It's the reason that pro wrestling is closer to reality
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:18.540]   than anything else we can watch or any other content.
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:20.540]   It's, we know it's made up.
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:26.380]   We know that it's a performance, it's storytelling.
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:31.340]   And that's how everything is,
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:34.940]   except we think wrestling's fake and the world is real.
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:37.880]   Wrestling's real and the world's fake.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.540]   - You talk about in the book,
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.660]   we're definitely going in this direction.
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:45.040]   In the book, you talk about this notion
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:49.060]   of entertaining the idea of the opposite being true as it.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:51.660]   And there's our not only emerging,
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:53.220]   but established fields of psychology
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:54.780]   that are making great ground, I think,
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:58.080]   into the human psyche, Byron Katie's work and others,
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.540]   where you take a statement and you start playing
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:04.180]   with that statement for, you poke at its authenticity.
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:05.480]   And when I first heard that, I thought,
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.220]   this is kind of hokey, right?
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:08.060]   It's just words.
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:10.460]   And then I realized how foolish I was being
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:13.300]   because she's really onto something.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:14.520]   And there are others too, of course,
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:18.260]   but in science, that's exactly what you do.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:21.660]   You don't really ask questions in science.
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:24.300]   You are forced to raise hypotheses
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:26.380]   and try and say true or false.
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.860]   Now, there are limitations to that approach, certainly.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:32.900]   I mean, pure observational studies have been incredible
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:34.420]   in terms of what they've revealed to us,
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:37.020]   especially medicine, a patient that has a bullet hole
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.360]   through a certain area of the brain.
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.440]   You don't go in and say, oh, I hypothesize
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.980]   that person will have a deficit in seeing faces.
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.540]   No, the person wandered into the clinic and they go,
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:47.420]   this person cannot, sees faces,
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:48.860]   but can't make sense of them.
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:53.860]   And then you forensically arrive at an understanding.
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:58.840]   But in general, we go about things in this way
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:02.300]   and considering that the opposite might be true.
[01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:03.940]   Well, that's a little bit, I suppose,
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:07.660]   of like seeing the whale at the surface of the water.
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:10.080]   It's like, well, the opposite of my experience,
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.780]   which is all above water for the most part,
[01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:17.380]   is maybe not the complete experience of life.
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:19.600]   You start seeing the inverse all the time.
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:20.660]   So I want to-
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:22.340]   - Consider the inverse all the time.
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:26.700]   - And it really relates to the way that you described
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:29.900]   how we see colors is based on contrast.
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:33.060]   So maybe blue's only blue in relation to yellow.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:37.680]   So if blue is our choice,
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:43.520]   if we're not considering yellow, blue doesn't exist.
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:44.780]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:45.620]   - Absolutely. - It's like,
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.660]   we talk about night, it's only night because there's day.
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:50.440]   If there was no day, there is no night.
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:55.440]   In all of our cases, it's like being in the end.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.480]   There's the light and the shadow always.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.960]   There's always another side for everything.
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:07.540]   And we focus on one aspect.
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:10.720]   But if we look at the other aspect,
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.680]   chances are we'll learn something too.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:18.000]   - The nervous system is not just able to do this.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.320]   It's the way it does everything.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.640]   At two experiments, I'll just briefly describe,
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.980]   my scientific great grandparents,
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:25.140]   David Hubel and Torrance Weasel,
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:28.080]   showed that if you force a person to look at something
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:30.840]   for a long period of time without moving their eyes,
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:33.400]   there's a way that you can do this, the image disappears.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.680]   Because normally your eyes are making little microsaccades
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.060]   and you're comparing what you're seeing
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.280]   to what's right next to it.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.680]   Pixel by pixel, pixel by pixel, pixel by pixel.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:42.780]   If we don't even have to use the example
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:45.680]   of pressing on the arm, we're sitting in chairs right now.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.680]   And until I said, what's going on at the level of sensation
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:49.780]   on the backs of your thighs,
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:52.120]   you were unaware of it because if you experience a pressure
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.800]   or a smell in a room, you ever walk in,
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.380]   the smell is either good or not good,
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:56.940]   pretty soon the smell disappears.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:01.940]   The neurons are still firing like sledgehammers on a bell,
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:05.040]   but we become blind and deaf to it
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.600]   because the nervous system likes to habituate
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:10.640]   the value of that signal when it's there often.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:13.520]   And it's only the stuff that comes through signal the noise
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:17.960]   that kind of jolts us into attention and awareness.
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:19.940]   And I want to return to attention awareness,
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:22.500]   which are prominent themes in the book.
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.780]   And I think in an important way,
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:27.300]   not just, oh, attention awareness is important,
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:31.780]   but you also give insight into how to pay better attention,
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:34.780]   how to pay awareness with the understanding
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.840]   that people are going to go about it differently.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:40.580]   But I do want to ask you about wrestling.
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:42.680]   Because when I was growing up,
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.700]   I was not, I lived south of the Cow Palace
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:47.080]   and there was some wrestling going on there.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.720]   I think back then it was WWF.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:51.420]   And there was a short stint in my childhood
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.960]   where I paid attention to, in particular,
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.060]   was it Coco B. Ware, the guy that had a macaw?
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:59.020]   I was obsessed with tropical birds
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.640]   and he would come in and he'd put his tropical bird
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.480]   on the thing.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:03.000]   And then who's that, George "The Animal" Steele,
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.500]   the guy that would eat the ring.
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:05.340]   - Yeah.
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:08.040]   - Okay, so, and-
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:11.420]   - I believe he was a professor, seriously, seriously.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:12.260]   Seriously.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:13.080]   - Was he really?
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:13.920]   - In real life.
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:14.740]   - Amazing.
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:15.580]   - He was a professor,
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.820]   he played George "The Animal" Steele as a wrestler.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:19.820]   - And I loved the movie, "The Wrestler."
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:22.980]   - Darren Aronofsky movie.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:24.820]   - It was Mickey Rourke.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:25.940]   Yeah, one of the reasons I liked it
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:29.040]   is I once visited Asbury Park.
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:31.220]   Isn't that where that was filmed?
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:33.940]   There's a vacant, he goes to visit his daughter,
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:36.000]   there's a vacant amusement park
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.580]   or abandoned amusement park scene there
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:39.540]   that was really eerie, still kind of haunts me a little bit.
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:44.180]   There's something about the East Coast in kind of fall,
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:46.980]   all the places that people normally go just for the summer
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:49.900]   that we don't have out here in the West Coast.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:52.020]   People in the East Coast are just tougher than we are.
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:54.540]   It still haunts me, great movie.
[01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:59.280]   But I remember watching wrestling and it was at that age,
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.500]   I think I was probably about 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13,
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:07.500]   where you're kind of entering puberty.
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:13.380]   So, and puberty is a fundamental landmark of development
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.580]   it's the most rapid period of aging.
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:18.660]   It's also when we start to change our rule set,
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:21.240]   like certain people and certain kinds of interactions
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:25.140]   take on profoundly different meaning, right?
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:28.340]   It's not just a reproductive competence time
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:30.780]   and when kids change, their bodies change,
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:33.300]   the rule book changes fundamentally.
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:35.420]   - Our understanding of the world changes in that moment.
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:37.660]   - Oh yeah, I mean, the moment that a child understands
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:40.960]   really what sex is and kind of how they got there
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:43.120]   and that a lot of the stuff that we see in the world
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.820]   is kind of passively or not so passively
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:49.440]   being sent through that filter, it's like, it's something.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:53.260]   It changes the rule book of perception.
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:58.980]   I view this age from about 11 to 13, at least for me,
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:03.980]   was a unique transition point where the gap between
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:08.020]   what I perceived as reality and fiction was kind of blurry.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:10.260]   This is captured pretty well in that movie Stand By Me
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:11.820]   where they're hanging around the campfire at night
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:13.800]   and the kid says, "Who do you think would win
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.460]   "in a fight between Superman and Mighty Mouse?"
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:19.220]   And the other kid says like, "You idiot.
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:21.680]   "Mighty Mouse is a cartoon.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:23.380]   "Of course Superman would win."
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:29.380]   And to me, that's being 11 and a half or 12 years old
[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:33.260]   where your understanding of reality as you know it
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:35.660]   is changing, but it's not completely crystallized
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:37.380]   into an adult form reality.
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.920]   - That sounds like a really healthy place to be, to me,
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.520]   like that, not letting it crystallize.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:46.900]   I think that's the, there's where the downfall happens.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:50.700]   - So I have questions specifically about wrestling,
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:52.360]   but it's really about process.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.260]   I want to know whether or not you watch wrestling
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:59.880]   because it allows you to access the energy state
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:04.040]   in your body and mind and that kind of mode of thinking
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:08.780]   in which reality, as one conceives it, is somewhat blurry.
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:14.740]   Or is it for a number of other reasons, which is fine.
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:16.980]   Is that the energy you're trying to export
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:21.520]   and bring to the creative process elsewhere, to life?
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:23.780]   Is it that anything is possible
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:25.260]   or that we're dealing with archetypes?
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:27.020]   'Cause it doesn't matter if it's Coco Beware
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:29.380]   or Randy Macho Man Savage or George The Animal Steel
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:30.980]   and the lovely Elizabeth.
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:33.820]   I guess I did watch a little bit of wrestling.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:36.860]   They are archetypes, much like the Greek myths
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:40.140]   or the Bible or no disrespect to the Bible
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:42.960]   or Greek myths or to wrestling for that matter.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.540]   Archetypes are a powerful filter for humans,
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:50.020]   but we know that they're a very limited filter too
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:53.320]   because people aren't built like square wave functions.
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.760]   We have curves and contours and complexity.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.380]   So what is the deal with your relationship to wrestling?
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:03.260]   - I think it maintains that kind of playfulness.
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:05.140]   Anything is possible.
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:09.100]   We expect the unexpected all the time in wrestling
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:14.100]   and it's a way to have a kind of a feeling
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:19.660]   of the energy of a sport with no competition.
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:23.900]   Everyone is working together
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:25.940]   to put on the best show they can.
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:30.180]   So it's more like a ballet than it is like a sporting event.
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:34.780]   And there's great skill involved.
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:37.420]   It's one of the few things that I can watch
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:39.740]   and really feel relaxed.
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:41.220]   It relaxes me.
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:42.840]   I don't feel like I have to think about it.
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:45.780]   I can just relax and enjoy it.
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:47.180]   - This brings up a topic
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:48.740]   that is very near and dear to my heart,
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:51.220]   which is this notion of dopamine schedules.
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:53.080]   I never want to reduce everything to dopamine,
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.000]   but dopamine is the universal currency
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.540]   of delight, pleasure, motivation seeking.
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:59.380]   There are other chemicals involved too,
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:02.440]   but there's a beautiful experiment
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.440]   and a couple of examples that I'll use as a foundation
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:09.420]   to more questions about wrestling and why it's powerful
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:12.460]   and why other people may want to use wrestling
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:15.500]   or some other endeavor as a way
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:18.260]   to access creative energy and source.
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:21.680]   Earlier, we talked about, you can train an animal
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:24.340]   to press a lever three times and then get reward.
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:27.100]   And it will learn three is the magic number for reward.
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:27.940]   And then it can switch.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.900]   It takes a little bit of training and then they can switch,
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:31.180]   but they can't do prime numbers.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:33.700]   They can't do high abstraction schedules.
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:36.240]   Humans either were not very good
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:40.800]   at figuring out the rule set for optimal foraging.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:43.040]   We do it well enough to persist as a species,
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.420]   at least for now,
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:49.000]   but it's very likely that we are not tapping
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.780]   into that system as well as we could.
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:53.540]   And how would we know if we don't know?
[01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:56.180]   It's one of those, you don't know what you don't know.
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:58.260]   There's a beautiful experiment that explored
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:01.860]   when dopamine is released in the context of watching sport
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:05.260]   or watching comedy, believe it or not.
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:06.540]   And with the comedy stuff,
[01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:08.060]   it was every time there was a surprise.
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:09.500]   It was kind of that jarringly ha ha,
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.780]   and they'd measure people's dopamine output.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:13.180]   They were also brain imaging.
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:16.560]   In a game of basketball,
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:18.760]   it's a beautiful opportunity experimentally
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:21.080]   because every time one team gets the ball
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:22.340]   or shooting free throws or something,
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:23.260]   they're going down court
[01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:26.500]   and it's either going to end up in the basket or it's not.
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:27.700]   Might end up on the free throw line,
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:28.540]   but it's in it or not.
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:31.740]   So what they found is that the schedule of anticipation
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:34.180]   was every time there was a switch of which team got it.
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:36.640]   So you're waiting, waiting, and then it's ah.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.240]   You're waiting, waiting, yes.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.640]   Waiting, waiting, three pointer, awesome.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.300]   And if something happened where it looked like
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:44.380]   they were going to make the three pointer,
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:47.620]   but then somebody basically swatted the ball away
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.100]   and then went for a half court shot,
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:50.980]   like you don't expect that very often,
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:52.380]   bigger dopamine release, okay?
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:54.420]   So that's kind of how the dopamine thing works.
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:56.940]   When you describe wrestling,
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:00.940]   I wonder, because you don't know the script,
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:03.220]   it's not one team gets it, then the other team gets it.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:04.540]   You don't know who's going to win.
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:07.220]   Anything could happen is what you said.
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:12.220]   The availability of that dopamine surge or drip,
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:13.820]   which is a powerful thing,
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:19.740]   is completely, it's completely out of your reach
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:21.360]   in terms of anticipation.
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.740]   You don't know when it's going to come,
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.580]   but it must arrive often enough
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:27.820]   that you return to it 11 hours a week of watching.
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:32.060]   In many ways, the way I'm starting to conceptualize
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:34.540]   the creative process is a little bit the same.
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:36.460]   You don't know where those nuggets of gold
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.180]   and those loose threads are,
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:39.820]   but you have enough experience,
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:42.340]   and in this case, I am referring to you specifically,
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:44.420]   to know that they are in there.
[01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:46.860]   The people walking in this room have a certain level
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:49.300]   of ability and talent to create
[01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:55.500]   that the map will form itself as we are going
[01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:58.940]   through the voyage and those nuggets of,
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:02.980]   here I'm calling them dopamine, but they are out there.
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:05.140]   And that knowledge is enough to get you to come back again
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:07.380]   and again, to trust the process.
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:11.820]   So I actually think the way you described wrestling as,
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:14.460]   it's the energy of the sport.
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:17.540]   It's not the, whether or not it's this move or that move
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:20.660]   or who wins or who loses, it's the energy.
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:22.020]   And I'm guessing it's the energy
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:25.260]   that it creates in you as an observer.
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:27.180]   - Yes, it's the energy it creates in me
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:32.180]   and the reality that it's honest in what it is
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:38.180]   in a world where seemingly nothing is honest at what it is.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:43.380]   And again, not because people are lying all the time.
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:46.660]   We have a little data, we make up a story to explain it,
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:48.980]   and then we say, that's what happened.
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:53.980]   And we have trusted sources who do exactly
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:45:00.100]   what I just described and who pass this down as gospel
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:06.220]   of what we teach and maybe it's true and maybe it's not.
[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:12.420]   With wrestling, we know maybe it's true, maybe it's not.
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:14.820]   We lean towards it not being true.
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:16.380]   But what's really interesting about wrestling
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:18.060]   and maybe one of the most fun things about it
[01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:23.060]   is that sometimes real life works its way into the story.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:29.060]   Like two wrestlers get married now.
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:30.060]   - In real life.
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:30.940]   - Well, we don't know.
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:32.420]   It's like that you never know.
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:35.740]   It's like in the storyline, they're getting married
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:40.740]   or getting divorced or best friends turn on each other.
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:45.660]   And it could be part of the story
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:49.180]   and it could really be happening because they do write,
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:51.900]   someone gets, someone breaks their leg.
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:54.620]   So they're out because their leg is broken.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:55.540]   Did they break their leg?
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:56.380]   We don't know.
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:57.620]   They're out.
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:58.980]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:00.620]   We're told they broke their legs.
[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:05.620]   So there's always this like, I wonder what's true.
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:08.820]   I wonder where the line is.
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:13.660]   We know that it's scripted or predetermined.
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:14.500]   That's how they say.
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:16.420]   It's predetermined.
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:20.820]   But we don't know where reality is and isn't.
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:25.820]   And in some ways that's our real experience of the world
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:30.580]   is this, we don't really know where reality is and isn't.
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:33.020]   We have an idea maybe.
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:35.780]   I think in some ways wrestling is more honest or legitimate
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:40.780]   because we start with the idea that it's fixed.
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:43.500]   When we go to a boxing match,
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:45.900]   we don't go to a boxing match thinking it's fixed,
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.220]   yet it might be.
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:50.500]   And historically it's happened.
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:53.500]   Or there was just something in baseball where,
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.020]   was it baseball?
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:56.020]   - I don't follow baseball.
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:56.860]   I should know.
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:46:59.980]   - There was just a big sports.
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:03.620]   One of the teams that-
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:04.820]   - The plays basically.
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:05.660]   - Yes.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:08.060]   - Was it the call signals of the catcher?
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:08.900]   - Yes.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:13.740]   - Because you're not supposed to deprogram
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:16.940]   or deconstruct the call signals of the other team.
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:19.420]   And I guess maybe a team got caught doing that.
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:20.260]   - Yes.
[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:24.220]   And the team that won whatever the World Series was.
[01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:29.220]   So it's like with wrestling, that wouldn't be a scandal.
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:30.140]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:30.980]   It's like-
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.580]   - Because almost anything goes.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:33.620]   - Anything goes.
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:36.320]   And that's what the world is really like.
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:39.460]   So in some ways it's comforting
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.020]   and there's still this mystery of like,
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:42.620]   wow, I wonder if that's true or not.
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:43.940]   Because we never really know.
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:45.200]   Someone gets hurt.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:47.180]   Did they really break their back
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:49.100]   or are they just going on vacation?
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:49.940]   We don't know.
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:50.780]   We'll never know.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:51.720]   It's fascinating.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:52.560]   - It is fascinating.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.660]   And I feel like there are certain people who show up
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:58.840]   in a way that is surprising in not just one direction,
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.040]   but in all directions.
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.740]   Like it's one thing for a celebrity to come out
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:03.340]   and make a statement.
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:04.920]   That can be interesting or not interesting
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:07.380]   depending on the celebrity and the statement
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:08.540]   and the delivery.
[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:10.380]   But, and I'm probably going to get this wrong
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:13.820]   because I'm terrible at pop culture things.
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:15.040]   Most of them anyway.
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:17.900]   But as I recall, Lady Gaga showed up to some event
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:21.060]   wearing an outfit made of meat.
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:23.140]   And I can't tell you for the life of me
[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:24.540]   whether or not that was a statement
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:26.900]   against meat or for meat.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.520]   Maybe it was a statement for the carnivore diet.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.020]   Maybe it was a statement for veganism.
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:31.660]   I don't know.
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:32.620]   - Or maybe neither.
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:33.660]   - Or maybe neither.
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:34.900]   But it was definitely a statement
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:37.140]   in that it broke with the norm.
[01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:39.320]   And it said to me, okay,
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:43.280]   she creates different rules for herself
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:47.720]   or so breaks boundaries that other people had.
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.820]   I never heard of anyone doing that before.
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:51.700]   This doesn't mean they hadn't,
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:53.800]   but I never heard of anyone doing it before.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:58.800]   But we do tend to associate outside the current playbook
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:05.640]   with quote unquote creativity, unless it crosses a line,
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:08.800]   in which case it becomes something else.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:11.040]   It becomes almost theater for sake of theater.
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:12.040]   But what you're telling me is that
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.580]   within the realm of wrestling,
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:17.320]   theater is the goal at some level.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.800]   And everybody knows it who goes into those arenas,
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:20.640]   who watches it.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.480]   - Yes.
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:22.300]   - Everybody.
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:23.560]   - Yes.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:27.620]   - And everyone agrees to kind of suspend outside reality
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:29.280]   and say, this is reality.
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:30.120]   - Yes.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:33.560]   And they boo for the bad guys and cheer for the good guys,
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.480]   knowing that backstage they're probably friends.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.860]   - Except for the kids that are 11
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:39.080]   who think it's really real.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:39.920]   - I don't know.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.140]   I don't even know if they know.
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:42.100]   I'm not sure.
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:44.320]   - The only other person I know
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:49.320]   who has vocalized their love of professional wrestling
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.800]   to the extent that you have is Lars Fredrickson,
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:54.820]   the rhythm guitar player for Rancid who loves wrestling.
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:57.220]   But his statement, and forgive me, Lars,
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:59.260]   while I'm getting this wrong,
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:01.800]   is that because he grew up in an area of the South Bay
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:03.320]   where there were no teams,
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:04.680]   now there's the San Jose Earthquakes,
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:06.340]   but there was no football team in San Jose.
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:07.360]   He's from Campbell.
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:10.320]   But there were no like good teams, no sports teams,
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:11.660]   but they had wrestling.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:13.400]   And he had it where?
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:15.200]   On the television set.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.800]   And so if you didn't have a,
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:20.520]   like I didn't grow up with any organized sports thing.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:23.320]   The 49ers were up the road, but for me it was skateboarding.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.780]   And I love it for the same reason.
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:27.860]   You actually never really know what's gonna happen.
[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:28.820]   There is no rule book.
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:31.120]   The rule book is made up.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.880]   But they are very, it's a unique sport in that,
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.780]   surfing's a bit like this too,
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:40.560]   in that they are absolutely maniacal
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.620]   about making things look a certain way.
[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:44.040]   It's not about just doing it.
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:47.360]   It's about doing it and making it look good.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:49.560]   Smooth, catching it with the front foot.
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.520]   You know, and the trends change.
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:52.680]   - Style. - Style.
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.520]   - It's a style.
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:56.480]   - Style is, and style is this like nebulous thing
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:58.920]   of like, you know, in fashion or in sport.
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:01.280]   - Right, whereas with a football there's some amazing catches
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.440]   there's even like the catch, which I happen to know
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:06.780]   is a 49er, the catch during the Super Bowl.
[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:09.840]   But in general, it's like the goal is get in the end zone,
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.080]   win the game.
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.760]   And I'm sure football players are like cringing
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.560]   as I say this, but it doesn't matter if you run ugly,
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.240]   if you run fastest.
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:19.020]   In skateboarding that would never fly.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:22.440]   In fact, you'd basically be ridiculed out of the sport.
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:24.920]   In wrestling, is it the same?
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:27.480]   Are there, is there style to wrestling?
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:29.520]   - It's all, it's all performance.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.760]   It's all the charisma of the people involved.
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:36.880]   There's the physical ability, the ability to talk
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:40.840]   and tell a story, and the, how charismatic
[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:41.740]   the performers are.
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:43.960]   Whether you want to watch them, whether you want to see
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:46.440]   them win, whether you want to see them lose,
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:49.000]   and whether you're interested in cheering
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.480]   or booing for them.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:52.840]   - I was going to say it reminds me of opera,
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.720]   but operas get released over and over again.
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:51:59.320]   You know the story and how it ends when you walk in,
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:01.120]   if you've listened to it before.
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:04.360]   So wrestling does seem to be unique in that way.
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:07.400]   It's real time iteration, at least from the perspective
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:08.360]   of the-
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:11.080]   - And it's real time iteration based on,
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:12.480]   because people get hurt all the time,
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:15.000]   they're doing really crazy physical stuff.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.380]   So if someone gets hurt, the story has to change
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.720]   because in real life they can't show up next week
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:23.960]   and do what was planned in the script.
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:28.960]   So it's very alive and there's a lot of,
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:36.060]   something interesting and unexpected is always happening.
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:42.280]   - Well, in a much more calm form,
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:43.720]   I'll share with you something.
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:45.240]   I just like your perspective on it.
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:50.240]   For years, I used a tool in order to try and access ideas.
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:54.160]   Since I was a little kid, actually,
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:57.280]   because I have a little bit of OCD,
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:58.540]   a little bit of a Tourette's.
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:52:59.740]   When I get tired, I'll do that.
[01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:03.560]   And like very like strategy implementation oriented.
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.020]   I had that when I was a little, little kid,
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.100]   I needed all my stuffed animals arranged in a certain way.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:10.540]   Lego is how to be, you know, full neurotic or a lot.
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:12.500]   And then science is very much about,
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.680]   you have to do things with a lot of precision.
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:17.700]   And I discovered that the ultimate reset for me
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:20.100]   when I was in graduate school or a postdoc,
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:22.480]   if I couldn't make it to a really good,
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:24.360]   like agnostic front show or like chaos,
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:26.080]   like the chaos of a punk rock show for me
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:27.080]   was kind of this reset.
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:29.280]   It was like, could like release all this thing.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:31.140]   And I got energy from it.
[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:33.540]   First time I saw transplants play and, you know,
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:34.600]   it was like, whoa,
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.220]   'cause you don't know what's going to happen.
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.780]   And it was scary and I loved it.
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:40.820]   The other thing that I used over time
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:45.040]   to kind of reset this ability to think in a structured way
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.820]   without it feeling like it was overcoming me,
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:49.000]   maybe even access the same thing in some ways
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.700]   that you're accessing with wrestling was,
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:52.980]   I like to stare at Aquaria.
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:55.320]   Like I like to go to aquariums or I'd build aquariums
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:56.160]   and I would just sit there
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:58.080]   because you never know which way the fish are going to go.
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:59.100]   You think it's going that way,
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:01.060]   but then all of a sudden they'll turn and go the other way.
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:02.740]   It's completely unpredictable.
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:04.900]   And I love Aquaria because of the tranquility
[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:07.900]   and had them in my lab for a long time.
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:12.380]   I just adore aquariums because of the non-linearity of it.
[01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:17.380]   It's not A, B, C, it's A, Z, Z, Q, you know?
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:19.060]   And I think this is what some people try
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:20.780]   and access through psychedelics,
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:23.260]   but that didn't seem to me like a very good way
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:25.540]   to do it on a regular basis.
[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:28.540]   Whereas with Aquaria, you just, the tanks are there.
[01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:31.200]   So in your book, you talk about something
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:33.060]   that I also share a love for,
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:38.060]   which is how the ocean and aspects of nature,
[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:42.420]   like clouds and ocean, they have a predictability to them.
[01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:44.980]   We know where they are and where to find them.
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:47.680]   Unfortunately, the sun rises and sets every day,
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.940]   at least for now.
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:53.940]   And we can count on them with 100% reliability.
[01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:56.640]   And yet they are from the perspective of like,
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:59.080]   what physicists would say, they're very chaotic.
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:00.880]   They, you can't look at a wave
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:02.660]   and know exactly how the foam is going to roll out.
[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:04.280]   You know it's going to roll in and roll out.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:05.160]   We have the tides.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:07.520]   But when I hear about wrestling,
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.240]   I think about my love of Aquaria.
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:11.960]   When I think about my love of punk rock music,
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.860]   for instance, or I think about the ocean,
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:19.140]   I think of it in that way that we actually have a need
[01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:22.700]   to source from things that have both a combination
[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:25.480]   of structure and no structure.
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:27.960]   - I think it's interesting that there are some places
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:31.320]   that don't change and some places that change a lot.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:33.620]   And I can remember thinking about this.
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:37.500]   I was walking, there's a beach that I walk on in in Hawaii
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.820]   that I walk on every morning when I'm there.
[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:43.040]   And if you walk on the same beach every day,
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:45.300]   you kind of get a sense of what it's like.
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:47.400]   And I remember I was in Hawaii,
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.520]   walked on the beach every day for a year, however long it was
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:52.920]   and then I left for six months and I came back
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:55.360]   and the next time I walked on the beach,
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:56:00.360]   it was an entirely different beach, entirely different.
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:03.980]   And I remember thinking in that moment,
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:05.720]   it's like, this is an unusual place
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:10.720]   because I pictured the house that I didn't even grow up in,
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:17.040]   the house I lived in maybe
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.560]   for the first seven years of my life.
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:22.020]   And I think about what the backyard looked like
[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:25.000]   and I think about a particular old tree that was there.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.600]   And I don't know this for sure, but my sense is,
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:30.380]   if I were to go back to where I grew up
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:34.400]   and go to that place and look in that yard,
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.640]   it would probably look pretty similar.
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:39.960]   Yet here was this beach that I was walking on in Hawaii
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:42.920]   that in the course of six months,
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:45.260]   completely changed its face.
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:47.960]   And just how interesting both of those things are
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:50.420]   and that depending on the project we're working on,
[01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:52.640]   to be able to go to a place
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.040]   that we know has the potential to change a lot
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:01.040]   and what that would do to our connection with the earth
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.740]   when we're experiencing that,
[01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:09.460]   versus going to a place that has very little change.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:11.760]   And you can kind of count on it
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:14.260]   being the way it's always been.
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.980]   That both of those are interesting things
[01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:17.400]   to be able to draw upon,
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:21.720]   depending on what we want to open in our psyche.
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:25.680]   - I have an almost unhealthy fascination
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:28.120]   with New York in the mid '80s and '90s.
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:30.900]   - You didn't live there though.
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:33.000]   - No, but since I was a kid,
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.260]   I went there when I was a little kid
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:35.580]   and I was fascinated by it.
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:37.240]   There's also a very interesting migration
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:40.200]   of East Coast to West Coast creatives,
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:41.100]   including yourself,
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:44.160]   that played an important part of my life,
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:46.360]   just seeing things and hearing things
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:47.380]   that were meaningful to me.
[01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:49.720]   But for instance, I love the movie.
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:51.320]   I haven't seen the documentary
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:54.120]   about Jean-Michel Basquiat because of the characters
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:55.980]   that are in it and the huge number of people in that,
[01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:58.620]   like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, and Christopher Wall,
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:57:59.920]   and on and on.
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:02.500]   Those images of New York at that time are so exciting
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.380]   and what was happening.
[01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:06.140]   I wish I could transplant myself to that.
[01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:08.680]   If I had a time machine, that's where I'd land first.
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:12.980]   I hear a lot of people say,
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:14.240]   New York isn't what it used to be.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:16.480]   San Francisco isn't what it used to be, whatever.
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:17.680]   LA isn't.
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:18.880]   There does seem to be something
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:20.920]   that feels a little bit disruptive to people
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:22.980]   about cities changing.
[01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:26.440]   But the idea that natural landscapes change
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:28.760]   is actually, we even accept like,
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:30.520]   hey, fire sweeps through places
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:33.020]   and assuming they weren't started by humans,
[01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:34.360]   we accept that.
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:36.840]   That change and the reordering of landscapes
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.440]   is normal and healthy.
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:39.840]   And I always tell myself,
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:41.280]   they have the kids growing up in New York
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.360]   or San Francisco or Chicago now,
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:44.660]   they only know it that way.
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:46.440]   So to them, it's as cool or as uncool
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:47.920]   as it's ever gonna be, right?
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:48.880]   They either wanna get out
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.760]   or they're loving every piece of it.
[01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:53.240]   And this happened for all the people that came before us.
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:56.760]   So my question is a very basic one.
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:59.000]   Do you miss the New York that you came up in?
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.400]   Are you somebody who is attached to the past?
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:02.640]   - I'm not attached at all.
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:04.880]   I'm not attached to anything in the past.
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:06.200]   I don't look back at all.
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:07.200]   - You don't think about like,
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:09.940]   oh, in my dorm room at NYU, Beastie Boys, this,
[01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:10.780]   like I miss...
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:14.480]   No, your optics are forward, present and forward.
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:16.440]   - Only present and forward.
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:19.960]   - Is there a process to that?
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:22.120]   Or it just happens to be where you default to?
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:22.960]   - I don't know.
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:25.580]   I'm not sure, but that's how I do it.
[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:29.780]   Nostalgia is not in Rick Rubin's brain.
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:30.620]   - No.
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:31.800]   - Oh, lucky you, man.
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:32.760]   - No.
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:36.740]   - I say that with genuine admiration.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:43.280]   So you can hear a song that maybe you had a role
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:45.160]   in producing or not, something from the past
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:49.320]   and you're accessing a state, presumably,
[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:52.040]   but you're not pining for or wishing how it was.
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:52.880]   - Never.
[01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:57.400]   I'm no psychologist, but I'm going to venture to say
[01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:59.840]   that I think that's a very unique quality.
[01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:04.280]   I think a lot of people wish for,
[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:07.820]   or wish that things did not happen the way they did,
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:09.500]   that there's a lot of living in the past.
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:12.960]   There's a lot of this notion of like people future trip.
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:15.120]   I don't actually think that's the default state
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:15.960]   of the brain.
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.760]   I think a lot of people live in emotional anchors
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:19.240]   to the past, good and bad.
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:22.920]   - Yeah, I have none.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:26.400]   And watching wrestling is one way that you cleanse the palate.
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:28.600]   - Yeah, it's true.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:30.640]   - When you go to a meal and they pass around this,
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:31.820]   they don't really do this anymore,
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:33.980]   but pass around a little bit of sorbet to cleanse the palate.
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:36.960]   It turns out there's a biological reason for that.
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:39.120]   There's a kind of neutralization of the taste receptors
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:41.380]   between savory and sweet, et cetera.
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:44.600]   So if wrestling is your palate neutralizer.
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:46.760]   - I know that if I watch wrestling before I go to sleep,
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:49.240]   it's going to be a good night's sleep.
[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:50.440]   - Do you dream about wrestling?
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.020]   - No, never.
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:55.520]   But it's just relaxing.
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:00.000]   It's just relaxing.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.600]   - Do you anticipate when you watch it,
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.380]   like here comes the dopamine hit?
[02:01:03.380 --> 02:01:05.160]   - Sometimes, sometimes when it happens.
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:06.960]   - He's going up for the three pointer.
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:09.280]   - Yeah, sometimes it's exciting.
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:10.120]   - But do you enjoy it?
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:12.200]   - But even then it's like the stakes are low.
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:13.880]   It's like, I don't really care what happens,
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:14.720]   which feels good.
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:18.840]   You know that I'm just being entertained.
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:22.240]   - Do they actually get hurt sometimes?
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:23.080]   - You said they do.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.840]   - A lot, often.
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:26.380]   I mean, they're basically stunt men.
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:29.720]   So imagine stunt men getting hurt doing a crazy stunt.
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:30.560]   It happens all the time.
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:31.600]   - Well, in the movie, "The Wrestler,"
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:33.720]   I remember he got staples stapled into him
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:35.120]   and I thought that's pretty intense.
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:36.960]   I once went and saw,
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:38.520]   I guess they called it Mexican wrestling.
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:39.920]   I don't know if they call it that anymore,
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.380]   where the guys dipped their hands.
[02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:42.740]   Yeah, they dipped their hands in glass.
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:43.880]   This was in Sacramento.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:44.720]   And I went and saw it.
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:46.840]   I honestly didn't have a stomach for it.
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:47.880]   I really didn't.
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:49.140]   I couldn't believe it was legal.
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:51.200]   It might not have been legal.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:52.040]   But I thought-
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:54.520]   - There's crazy stuff in wrestling sometimes.
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:55.360]   - Wow.
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:57.880]   So before sleep,
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:01:59.720]   is that typically when you watch wrestling?
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:01.280]   - Yes.
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.620]   - Do you think it's useful for people to have some activity
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:07.100]   that allows them to kind of clear their mind
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:10.120]   and create peace before heading off to sleep?
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:10.960]   - I think so.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:12.440]   And I think yoga nidra would be a good,
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.640]   like it's like yoga nidra, pro wrestling,
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:17.480]   any of the, any of those type things.
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:19.200]   - Yeah, not watching the Dalmer thing.
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:20.280]   I won't watch that.
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:21.780]   I-
[02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:23.840]   - I don't watch any horror, any anything,
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:26.080]   or I don't like violent things.
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:26.920]   - Yeah.
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:27.740]   I know it exists.
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:29.320]   I know horrible things happen in the world,
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:31.480]   but I certainly don't want to do that before sleep.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:33.720]   I think these liminal states before
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:37.320]   and emerging from sleep are very powerful.
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:38.920]   When you wake up in the morning,
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:42.260]   are your thoughts immediately structured
[02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:44.720]   or do you enjoy the kind of clearing of the clouds?
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:47.460]   - It's a slow process for me to wake up.
[02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:48.300]   And I like that.
[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:53.300]   I like not engaging too much too soon.
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:56.540]   I also, another,
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:59.260]   I usually fall asleep listening to a lecture
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:04.260]   or something speaking because if I don't,
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:07.340]   I can get caught in my own thoughts
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:12.340]   and listening to something is enough of a focus point
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:15.920]   that it stops me from talking to myself.
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:16.920]   - Yeah, I do the same.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:18.760]   My grandfather listened to the radio,
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:22.960]   to sports on the radio and he would fall asleep.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:25.740]   Oftentimes he was a smoker with a cigarette in his mouth.
[02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:29.240]   His wife's responsibility was to stay up later than he did
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:31.600]   and make sure they didn't burn everything down.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:36.160]   And then when you wake up, you said it's a slow process.
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.580]   Is it an hour or two before you feel like you're-
[02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:41.080]   - I would say probably an hour.
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:43.280]   I usually wake up and try to get in the sun
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.720]   as soon as I possibly can
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:49.900]   and hope to spend about an hour.
[02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:52.200]   And then I'll usually go for a walk on the beach
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.760]   for another hour or 90 minutes, depending.
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:00.560]   - Are you with family members and other people at that time?
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:03.680]   - No, I'm usually focused by myself.
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:05.040]   - Phone?
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:06.520]   - I'll be listening to something.
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:08.360]   I don't look at the phone, but I listen.
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:13.300]   I listen to, again, a lecture or a podcast or audio book.
[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:14.580]   I like audio books a lot.
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:15.720]   - Yeah, I do too.
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:18.340]   If an idea comes to mind, do you write it down?
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:20.260]   - I may, it depends.
[02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:21.700]   I like to.
[02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:26.580]   I usually would do a note in my phone.
[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:28.460]   I don't usually carry pen and paper with me
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:29.860]   when I'm walking.
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:30.700]   - Yeah, I do the same.
[02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:32.380]   I do a long Sunday hike or jog
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:35.100]   and I will audio script into my phone.
[02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:37.520]   People sometimes give me funny looks
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:38.740]   'cause I'm talking to myself.
[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:39.880]   - That's a nice way to do it though.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:44.200]   I'd like to learn more of the audio methods of doing it
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:45.880]   instead of the typing methods.
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:48.320]   Right now I type and I don't think it's the best way.
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:53.320]   - The voice memos function in the iPhone and other phones
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:54.520]   is really good.
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:58.260]   And they're now companies like rev.com
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:01.200]   that will turn those into Word doc scripts
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:06.200]   that are fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive.
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:08.100]   No, they're not a sponsor of the podcast.
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:08.940]   I just happen to use it.
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:09.860]   It's great.
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:12.460]   I actually learned that trick from Richard Axel,
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:16.960]   the Nicorette chewing wild man Nobel prize winner.
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:21.980]   He writes manuscripts and by walking around his office,
[02:05:21.980 --> 02:05:23.700]   pacing and talking into his phone.
[02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:25.940]   - I always think of the Woody Allen movie
[02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:30.940]   where the Allen Alder character is talking about,
[02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:35.400]   yeah, he's speaking comedy ideas into the phone.
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:37.260]   It's really pretentious.
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:39.900]   - I liked that movie about Harvey Milk,
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:41.620]   that Sean Penn played Harvey Milk
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:43.740]   because that all took place before I was alive,
[02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:44.860]   mostly in the Bay Area.
[02:05:44.860 --> 02:05:47.360]   But there's these beautiful scenes of him,
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:49.580]   as I recall, sitting there at his kitchen table,
[02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:51.720]   talking into a tape recorder at night,
[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:52.820]   talking about how he predicted
[02:05:52.820 --> 02:05:55.920]   that he would be possibly assassinated, et cetera.
[02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:57.940]   And this goes back to the strummer thing
[02:05:57.940 --> 02:05:59.380]   about writing things down.
[02:05:59.380 --> 02:06:02.900]   I think that a lot of people, including myself,
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:06.740]   feel a little bit of egotistical guilt around like,
[02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:09.680]   who am I to think that my ideas could be worthwhile
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:10.520]   or something?
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:14.400]   But I think over time I've come to realize
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.660]   that the ideas about experiments or health,
[02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:18.180]   questions I have about health,
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:24.100]   they don't always, but oftentimes can lead to real seeds
[02:06:24.100 --> 02:06:24.940]   that grow into trees.
[02:06:24.940 --> 02:06:27.260]   - But it's something that's interesting to you.
[02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:30.440]   It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:35.440]   Like most of my notes are not for anyone else's use.
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:38.840]   Like I hear about something that's interesting to me
[02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:41.460]   and I think about, okay, I want to learn more about this,
[02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:42.300]   whatever it is.
[02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:44.420]   And then sometimes those things work their way
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:45.300]   into things I'm doing
[02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:48.300]   because the universe seems to work in that way.
[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:50.780]   But I rarely am learning something
[02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:54.080]   with the idea of using it.
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:57.940]   I learn things with the idea of this is what I want to know.
[02:06:57.940 --> 02:06:59.940]   This is what's interesting to me.
[02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:03.200]   And then often those things that are interesting to me
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:07.540]   can find their way into other projects just because they do.
[02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:10.460]   - Yeah, it's almost like Kohler kindling,
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:13.200]   but the moment that you think of it that way,
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:16.800]   it sort of, it sounds so extractive, right?
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:19.640]   But if you, so you take this walk
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:24.460]   and you're writing down the occasional idea perhaps,
[02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:29.220]   and then what is the next sort of the way that,
[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:31.660]   here are less than do this, then this, then that.
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:34.080]   I'm interested in like, where does your mind shift to?
[02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:36.140]   Does it become more structured as the day goes on?
[02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:39.220]   Does your thinking become more structured around projects
[02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:43.220]   and plans? - I try to deal with things
[02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:45.840]   that need dealing with after that
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:49.440]   and in preparation for going to work.
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:52.920]   And then when I go to work, it's more like free,
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:56.140]   this free thing where I'm, again,
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:01.020]   hoping something good comes, welcoming something good,
[02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:05.460]   paying attention and maybe trying to will it to happen,
[02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:10.460]   but knowing I don't have the ability to make it happen.
[02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:15.540]   I can just be present for it and be ready if it does arrive.
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:19.040]   - Some of the more surprising,
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:22.780]   and I found really interesting and useful features
[02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:27.780]   of the book were about dancing with structure
[02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:29.620]   and lack of structure.
[02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:32.300]   So when I think of structure, I think of like deadlines.
[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:35.740]   So when you are in the process of creating something,
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:40.660]   obviously deadlines are relevant, time of day, right?
[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:42.200]   There's only so many hours in the day
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:44.060]   where one can stay in the groove
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:46.360]   or this like readiness to receive.
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:51.140]   Have you ever found yourself in that mode
[02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:53.580]   where you're kind of grinding like, ah, like here we are,
[02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:55.660]   like, okay, I'm not coming home for dinner at night.
[02:08:55.660 --> 02:08:58.260]   It's the next, you know, we're going to push.
[02:08:58.260 --> 02:09:00.860]   We're like put on the coffee pot kind of thing.
[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:04.940]   - A lot, a lot in the, over the course of my life a lot,
[02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:06.620]   not as much now.
[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:10.200]   And one of the things that I discovered
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:15.200]   through working on the book was the phases of work.
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:19.020]   We're not required to treat the different phases of work
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:19.980]   in the same way.
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:22.300]   Whereas before I did,
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:26.520]   before everything was in this state of play,
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:31.440]   everything had a wide open time schedule.
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.080]   It happens when it happens.
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:37.440]   And if it takes two years or three years,
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:39.320]   it doesn't matter, it's not about that.
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:41.760]   It's only about this thing has to be great.
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:43.860]   And what I came to realize in working on the book
[02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:46.340]   is that there are different phases.
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:49.220]   And the first phase is this seed collecting phase,
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:52.820]   which is kind of an ongoing part of life in general.
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:53.880]   I do that.
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:58.880]   I do that always, whether I'm working on something or not,
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:01.020]   I'm always in the seed collecting phase
[02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:05.260]   and there's no deadline or just anything that interests me
[02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:08.540]   that I think I want to learn more about
[02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:11.180]   or has potential to be something, anything.
[02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:14.440]   Something, I hear something, think, hmm,
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:15.580]   I'd like to read more about that.
[02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:17.700]   Or I wonder if there's a movie about that.
[02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:18.660]   Is there a movie about that?
[02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:21.220]   If not, maybe there's a movie to be made.
[02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:25.200]   You know, again, this is something I want in my life.
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:26.160]   Let's see if it exists.
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:27.100]   If it doesn't exist,
[02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:30.160]   then maybe that's something interesting to pursue.
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:32.760]   But I know that the desire is there 'cause I have it.
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:36.960]   So in the seed phase, there's no deadlines.
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:39.500]   It's just a wide open part.
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:42.440]   And then the next phase is called the experimentation phase
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:45.380]   where you start experimenting
[02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:47.300]   to see what the seeds want to do.
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:51.820]   You're involved, but you're more of a,
[02:10:51.820 --> 02:10:58.400]   you're not really dictating the action.
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:02.820]   You're setting the stage for something to happen,
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:04.880]   but it's not about you yet.
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:10.180]   So it'd be like the equivalent of you'd plant the seed,
[02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:11.540]   you would water it,
[02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:14.600]   you would make sure it was in the sun and you'd wait.
[02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:20.500]   So you're involved, but you can't make it grow, you know?
[02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:22.720]   And then when it sprouts and it grows
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:25.120]   and or if it turns into a plant,
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:26.900]   then you can look at the plants like,
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:28.480]   okay, how does this plant,
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:31.680]   what's the potential of this plant?
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:34.860]   And then that the third phase is the crafting phase
[02:11:34.860 --> 02:11:37.220]   where it's like, okay, I have this plant,
[02:11:37.220 --> 02:11:38.480]   maybe I'm gonna trim it,
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:42.320]   or maybe I'm gonna combine it with these other plants
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:43.880]   to make something else with it.
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:46.540]   Now it's like material that you have.
[02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:51.120]   And then finally is the completion or finishing phase,
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:55.980]   which is the final edit, getting to the version of it,
[02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:57.440]   the version of it that's the one
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:58.660]   that you can share with the world
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:00.400]   if that's something you're gonna do.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:05.040]   And I've come to realize that by the time
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:08.560]   you're going into the completion phase,
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:12.200]   you can have a deadline and it won't hurt the project.
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:14.240]   In fact, it might help the project.
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:15.560]   And I didn't know that before.
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:18.080]   So I've worked on projects that have gone longer
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:20.320]   than they necessarily needed to,
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:24.480]   and maybe not in the best interest of the project
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:25.580]   because I didn't know that.
[02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:28.560]   I didn't understand the timing of that
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:33.560]   because I am so aware of the necessity
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:39.880]   in the experimental phase to not have a deadline,
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:44.660]   that I assumed that that held through the whole project.
[02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:50.640]   And it's not a clear phase one finishes
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:52.680]   and then you start phase two, phase two finishes
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:54.160]   and then you start phase three.
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:55.920]   You move back and forth between them.
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:57.280]   I'm collecting seeds all the time.
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:59.080]   I'm always in phase one.
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:02.360]   And then probably to some degree,
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:05.440]   there's always some version of experimentation going on.
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:08.320]   Maybe not now, but if something's on a list of things
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:11.480]   I wanna look at, hopefully I'll get to the list
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:13.360]   and give them some experimentation
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:15.340]   and see what they can turn into.
[02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:18.000]   And then if they do turn into something,
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.600]   then they get to the crafting phase where it's more,
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:22.960]   okay, now I have this thing.
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:25.520]   What do I know about this kind of thing?
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:27.320]   What can I match this with?
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:28.560]   What can I use this for?
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:31.640]   How can I be involved as a craftsman?
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:34.480]   And by the end of the crafting phase
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:36.860]   or deep into the crafting phase,
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:40.080]   you can start seeing the end.
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:41.800]   You can start seeing an end
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:44.060]   and then you can even dictate an end.
[02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:46.520]   But I recommend if you do just dictate it for you,
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:47.360]   not for anyone else,
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:51.080]   because if something comes up where you learn,
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:56.080]   if you set a deadline, a public deadline,
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:59.600]   and then a new discovery happens along the way
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:01.440]   and you realize, oh, this could actually be much better
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:04.020]   than I thought, but I need more time.
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:06.540]   It's harder to do that if you set the deadline.
[02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:11.080]   So I would say have an internal deadline to get to finish it.
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:15.040]   That said, if an unusual situation comes up
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:18.260]   and it's better for everything not to meet that deadline,
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:22.760]   it's one of those rules that you set the rule to break it
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.980]   if it's what's best for the project.
[02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:29.500]   But that was a new thing for me and it helped me a lot.
[02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:32.080]   - When did you realize that?
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:35.080]   - In collecting the material for the book
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:39.180]   and thinking about it, when I realized that it was phases,
[02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:40.600]   I didn't know any of this.
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:42.660]   When I started writing the book,
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:46.180]   I didn't know hardly any of the things in the book.
[02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:51.180]   They were more, most of it would be reverse engineering,
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:56.600]   something that I had experience, a successful experience,
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:00.260]   using these methods without knowing they were methods,
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:04.900]   just following my instincts got me to something good.
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:09.900]   And then I would look back at why did I want to do that?
[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:14.480]   And is there a principle at play
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:18.800]   that could be of use outside of this case?
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:21.160]   And how do I explain that?
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:22.380]   And that's what the book is,
[02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:25.540]   is these reverse engineered principles
[02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:29.580]   that have led to good decision-making
[02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:31.080]   and trying to make things.
[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:36.340]   The chapter on self-doubt was really interesting to me.
[02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:37.340]   That's where all-
[02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:39.660]   - Tell me what it says 'cause I can't remember.
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:42.220]   - Well, I'll read the first sentence of it,
[02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:45.620]   which is that self-doubt lives in all of us.
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:49.300]   And while we may wish it was gone, it is there to serve us.
[02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:52.900]   And it goes on to describe how to dance with self-doubt
[02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:56.380]   in not so many words.
[02:15:56.380 --> 02:16:00.100]   I think there's a saying that is actually
[02:16:00.100 --> 02:16:03.080]   from the landscape of psychology,
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:05.700]   which is generally discussed
[02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:08.780]   in a kind of pathological context,
[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:12.700]   which is if nothing matters, anything goes.
[02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:15.060]   This is usually the phrase used to describe people
[02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:18.200]   who feel as if like there's no use in living,
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:22.620]   so just go crazy often to self-destruct.
[02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:26.020]   But there's a light version of this, I realize,
[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:29.260]   where in some sense the creative process
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:31.640]   seems to have something to do with,
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:33.880]   if you're not paying attention to what outcomes are,
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:35.700]   like who likes it, who doesn't like it,
[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:37.100]   and you're just doing it for you,
[02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:41.600]   you make the rule play, I want to delight myself,
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:45.040]   well, then anything goes and you have an infinite rule set
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:47.340]   there to extract from, at least initially.
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:52.340]   So as one gets better at their craft,
[02:16:52.340 --> 02:16:54.380]   you can imagine self-doubt goes down.
[02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:56.840]   I think that's the perception of a lot of people, right?
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:16:58.800]   You get better at what you're doing.
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:02.260]   You can land more free throws as a basketball player.
[02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:04.180]   You can hit more home runs as a baseball player.
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:08.040]   You can produce more platinum albums as an artist.
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:12.180]   Self-confidence goes up, self-doubt goes down.
[02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:14.580]   But I think you and I both know a number of people
[02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:17.240]   who are successful enough to know that oftentimes
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:20.060]   there's a mirror image to that where people feel pressure
[02:17:20.060 --> 02:17:22.580]   because they did it once, now they got to do it again.
[02:17:22.580 --> 02:17:27.580]   - Yes, or that you think your self-doubt
[02:17:27.580 --> 02:17:32.580]   and you think you're so good at it that it comes easily
[02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:34.640]   and you don't have to apply yourself.
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:35.620]   - Arrogance.
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:40.620]   - Yeah, so self-doubt, it's a check on yourself.
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:47.560]   It can either be really helpful or it can undermine you.
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:51.760]   So it's something we all have and if we let it undermine us,
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:54.160]   then we don't make anything and that's not good.
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:18:01.800]   But when used as a balancing tool in our lives,
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:03.900]   it serves a great function.
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:07.820]   Where we really do, it's okay to have all the confidence
[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:12.160]   in the world and still second guess
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:13.660]   is this the best it can be?
[02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:17.180]   I think the phrases in the book,
[02:18:17.180 --> 02:18:20.600]   you can doubt your way to a great work, to a masterpiece.
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:28.580]   Sometimes that questioning allows you to push further
[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:31.560]   than just accepting I made it so it's good.
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:36.060]   - Yeah, I've encountered more people that seem to be driven
[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:41.060]   by self-doubt and the need to constantly perform
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:44.240]   and perform again than I have real arrogance.
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:46.880]   Just that's been my experience, fortunately.
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:48.520]   I've met some arrogant people in my life,
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:52.840]   but, and of course we never, as a psychiatrist
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:55.200]   who I admire a lot and bio-engineer who was a guest
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:57.600]   on this podcast, Karl Deisseroth said,
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:01.520]   "We never really know how other people feel."
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:03.260]   I mean, most of the time we don't even know how we feel.
[02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:05.900]   Again, language is a very deprived format
[02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:07.040]   for explaining feelings.
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:09.660]   So we think somebody feels one way, but we can observe
[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:12.520]   and it could be another, but we observe their behavior.
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:15.180]   So in the sense of returning to the work,
[02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:17.620]   just always returning to process.
[02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:19.820]   It sounds like your routine is fairly scripted,
[02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:23.560]   at least now, but the things that you are getting
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:28.560]   in touch with, wrestling, sleep and dreaming, the ocean,
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:32.860]   there's a predictability of them because you can access them
[02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:35.920]   in a predictable way, but they seem to have
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:37.920]   a lot of unpredictability in them.
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:39.960]   The ocean is completely unpredictable.
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:42.460]   - I also listen to a lot of music that I don't know.
[02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:47.460]   So I listen to a lot of classical music and less so,
[02:19:49.660 --> 02:19:54.240]   but some jazz and a lot of old music
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:56.260]   that I never heard before.
[02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:59.780]   And I like being surprised by music.
[02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:04.800]   And sometimes it really catches me off guard.
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:06.800]   Like I shazam a lot, you know,
[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:09.100]   when I hear something I like.
[02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:12.720]   - Have you ever encountered music that really works well
[02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:15.480]   live, but just does not work in a recording?
[02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:18.140]   Or that is that much better live,
[02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:20.100]   but the recording is sort of meh.
[02:20:20.100 --> 02:20:21.780]   You don't have to name names.
[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:22.600]   - Yeah, I don't think so.
[02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:27.160]   I feel like maybe there is some artists who are great live,
[02:20:27.160 --> 02:20:29.960]   who've never captured it well on record.
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:32.620]   Example would probably be The Grateful Dead's
[02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:34.900]   a good example of a band where I feel like their albums
[02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:37.700]   are not their strong point, but there,
[02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:40.340]   if you hear live recordings, they're really interesting
[02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:42.260]   and really different from each other.
[02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:44.580]   And that's kind of part of what makes The Grateful Dead
[02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:47.960]   interesting is their unpredictability.
[02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:50.740]   I confess, I had a sister who listened to The Grateful Dead
[02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:52.900]   and I got taken to a few shows when I was younger
[02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:54.660]   and they would do that, what is it called?
[02:20:54.660 --> 02:20:57.020]   Space, it was like these drum solos
[02:20:57.020 --> 02:20:58.520]   that would go on for hours and hours.
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:00.380]   This is like the antithesis of punk rock shows
[02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:02.480]   where songs are like 90 to 120 seconds.
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:06.780]   And I remember thinking like, what is this?
[02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:07.620]   What is this?
[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:12.060]   But people I know who love The Grateful Dead,
[02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:16.380]   love that uncertainty about where that drum thing,
[02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:17.820]   I think they do call it space.
[02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:18.920]   Forgive me, dead heads.
[02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:21.160]   I'm not enough of one to get it right.
[02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:24.160]   - But they're looking for something
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:25.980]   and sometimes they find it.
[02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:28.940]   And if you're there when they find it, it feels exciting.
[02:21:28.940 --> 02:21:33.940]   'Cause it's not just, it's not just following a script.
[02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:37.200]   It's like something is really happening.
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:39.360]   It's a real moment.
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:44.360]   It's something that I aim for in the studio
[02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:50.700]   is to create real moments that when you hear them,
[02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:53.500]   they don't necessarily sound perfect.
[02:21:53.500 --> 02:21:56.000]   They sound like something that really happened.
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.340]   And in that moment, something happened
[02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:00.260]   and it's a special moment.
[02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:05.260]   And you can feel that if they were to play it again,
[02:22:05.260 --> 02:22:08.940]   it wouldn't be like that.
[02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:11.060]   There's something really exciting about that.
[02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:15.680]   It's really what, it's how jazz works as well.
[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:20.680]   And I think some of bringing some of that jazz mentality
[02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:25.960]   into other types of music is really interesting
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:27.980]   and makes for compelling things.
[02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:32.280]   'Cause when you hear them, there's a certain amount of,
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:36.880]   you really have to pay attention to do it.
[02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:39.320]   When you're doing it, you're really paying attention.
[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:41.120]   It's like, I don't really know.
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:42.060]   There's no music.
[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:46.660]   There's no map to follow.
[02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:50.260]   And now we're working together to make something.
[02:22:50.260 --> 02:22:52.060]   Do I play or not play?
[02:22:52.060 --> 02:22:53.660]   When do I play?
[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:55.440]   And you're really paying attention.
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:58.620]   And can I add, or you go to start adding something
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:01.700]   and someone else added something like, oh, I can't do that.
[02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:06.220]   And it's like, everyone's just in this thing,
[02:23:06.220 --> 02:23:10.200]   in this moment, experiencing this thing at once
[02:23:11.900 --> 02:23:14.820]   that you can feel as a listener.
[02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:19.820]   And we get to hear their excitement of finding it.
[02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:23.360]   And it's thrilling when it happens.
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:25.380]   So I like that experience.
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:28.060]   I feel like that's kind of what the dead do live.
[02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:30.080]   They'll play songs in different ways.
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:33.580]   And again, I don't know very much about the dead
[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:35.020]   and it's sort of a newer,
[02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:37.600]   it's newer for me to listen to the dead.
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:39.980]   Growing up, I never listened to the dead.
[02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:42.500]   But probably because I heard songs on their albums
[02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:44.340]   and thought, this doesn't really speak to me.
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:47.420]   But I think that the albums don't really reflect
[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:49.340]   what's special about them.
[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:51.260]   - I think a lot of their shows were recorded, right?
[02:23:51.260 --> 02:23:52.220]   Or videotaped.
[02:23:52.220 --> 02:23:56.380]   - Yes, by fans, which they supported.
[02:23:56.380 --> 02:23:59.140]   They supported that everybody come, everybody tape,
[02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:01.580]   everybody trade tapes.
[02:24:01.580 --> 02:24:04.540]   It made sense for who that band was.
[02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:07.420]   - They redefined, or they defined, excuse me,
[02:24:07.420 --> 02:24:08.540]   the notion of followers.
[02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:10.580]   I mean, people literally gave up their lives
[02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:12.580]   or spent much of their lives
[02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:15.980]   literally driving from city to city to follow them.
[02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:19.140]   - Because it's not like going from city to city
[02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:21.340]   to watch a movie over and over.
[02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:22.800]   'Cause it's not a movie.
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:24.900]   It's different every night, it's changing.
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:27.780]   - Pretty incredible phenomenon.
[02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:31.960]   I don't know of anything else quite like it except cults.
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:34.460]   And those often don't end well.
[02:24:34.460 --> 02:24:36.840]   [laughs]
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:39.080]   - I think a guy that mixed the punch
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:41.220]   for the Jonestown Massacre went to my high school.
[02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:42.280]   That was the- - Is that true?
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:43.440]   - I think so, yeah. - That's amazing.
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:45.600]   - My sister is really good at all this kind of like
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:50.600]   '70s, '80s, like dark psychology trivia.
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:52.320]   She's a very light person, but-
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:54.500]   - Did you read "Season of the Witch?"
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:55.340]   - No.
[02:24:55.340 --> 02:24:57.040]   - It's about San Francisco in the '60s.
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:24:58.760]   It's great, you'll love it.
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:00.240]   - One- - Great book.
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:01.640]   - I'll have to check it out.
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:06.760]   The way you describe experiences going by in time
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:10.240]   or things emerging in time and the creative process
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:14.640]   being a way of sort of capturing those moments,
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.560]   maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:21.640]   I thought was beautifully captured
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:25.880]   in the analogy you gave about a kind of a conveyor belt
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:29.500]   going by of things, right?
[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:30.860]   That we think of the creative process
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:34.560]   like it's going to land in us or we're going to enter it
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:35.760]   or that we're going to sit there in a chair
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:36.920]   and like grid our teeth.
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:38.980]   There's like a some Hemingway quote
[02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:40.480]   where you just sit there and stare at the page
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:42.920]   until the beads of blood form on your forehead or something.
[02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:44.320]   Maybe it was him, maybe it was,
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:45.520]   sounds like Bukowski or something.
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:46.760]   Anyway, I'm going to get this wrong.
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:48.320]   People tell me in the comments.
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:51.760]   Maybe no one said it, it was a dream.
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:55.680]   But I love this conveyor belt thing.
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:58.040]   That reminds me of being in laboratory,
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.820]   doing experiments thinking I was trying to solve one thing
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:03.760]   and then seeing something else
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:05.040]   and then having to make the decision,
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:07.320]   like is that really cool enough to drop everything
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:10.360]   and go that direction or to kind of spend a night
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:12.160]   or a week or a career going that way?
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:13.760]   I mean, these are kind of big decisions
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:15.200]   given that at least as far as we know,
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:18.220]   we're going to live 100 years or less.
[02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:21.400]   But this idea that we have, you know,
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:23.520]   thoughts and experiences in our past
[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:26.000]   and we can draw on and like try and make good decisions.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.960]   Do we like grab these things off the conveyor or not?
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:32.980]   I'm hearing you and I'm starting to realize
[02:26:32.980 --> 02:26:37.300]   that being attached to the past might be the worst thing
[02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:39.700]   that one could do in terms of being able
[02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:43.440]   to make good decisions in this context.
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:45.280]   Because we have a kind of a playbook
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:46.880]   of what's worked and what hasn't worked.
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:49.000]   But you actually talk about this.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.700]   There's a passage in the book, you know,
[02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:52.960]   that I'll just read it.
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:55.880]   To be aware of the assumption
[02:26:55.880 --> 02:26:58.000]   that the way you work is the best way
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.500]   simply because it's the way you've done it before.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.600]   I sat with this page for almost 10 full minutes,
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:06.820]   which is not something I do very often.
[02:27:06.820 --> 02:27:10.000]   Maybe you could elaborate on this a little bit.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.280]   I mean, we want to have, you know,
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:15.440]   mechanisms and routines we can trust.
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:19.500]   But this is a, I think an important warning.
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:22.920]   - Yeah, when something works,
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:27.920]   it's easy to be fooled into believing
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:31.120]   that's the way to do it or that's the right way.
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:33.480]   It's just a way.
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:36.860]   And it's just a way that happened to work that time.
[02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:41.860]   And this plays into when you get advice
[02:27:41.860 --> 02:27:47.120]   from people who have more experience than you.
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:50.740]   You explain your situation.
[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:52.720]   They tell you their advice.
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:54.220]   The advice that they're giving you
[02:27:54.220 --> 02:27:57.800]   is not based on your life or your experience.
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:00.800]   It's based on their life and their experience.
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:03.240]   And the stories that they're telling
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:05.680]   are based on experiences they've had
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:10.800]   that have very different data points than yours.
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:14.640]   So maybe they're giving you good advice,
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:17.460]   but maybe they're giving you good advice for them
[02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:19.460]   and not giving you good advice for you.
[02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:25.320]   And it's easy when we try something
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:29.080]   and have a result, a positive result,
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:34.080]   thinking this is, everybody can do this.
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:38.580]   You know, the way I was vegan for a long time, 22 years,
[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:43.580]   and then I started eating, I started eating animal protein
[02:28:43.580 --> 02:28:50.080]   and then eventually changed my diet a few times
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:52.120]   to the point where I lost a lot of weight.
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:54.880]   The way that I did it worked for me.
[02:28:57.640 --> 02:28:59.920]   Right before that happened,
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:04.360]   I did something that I was told
[02:29:04.360 --> 02:29:07.560]   that everyone else who did what you did,
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:10.360]   they all lost weight for whatever reason I didn't.
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:15.160]   So the idea that we know what's right for someone else,
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:17.440]   I think it's hard enough to even figure out
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:19.340]   what's right for ourselves.
[02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:23.600]   And if we do somehow crack the code of what's right for us,
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:27.880]   be happy we have it, and then still know,
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:29.560]   I wonder if that's the only way.
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:30.920]   Maybe there's an even better way
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:32.280]   that we're not considering.
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:36.700]   You know, like not to get comfortable
[02:29:36.700 --> 02:29:39.420]   with thinking we know how it works
[02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:42.080]   just because we get the outcome we want.
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:44.560]   - I was raised in science with a principle.
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:46.600]   It was literally dictated to me as a principle,
[02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:48.100]   almost like a rule of religion,
[02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:50.440]   which was that the brain is plastic.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:52.520]   It can change and learn until you're about 25
[02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:55.560]   and then the critical periods end and that's it.
[02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:57.280]   And this was a rule,
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:59.640]   essentially it was dictated a Nobel Prize,
[02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:00.740]   which was very deserved,
[02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:02.700]   given to my scientific great-grandparents.
[02:30:02.700 --> 02:30:03.680]   They deserve it.
[02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:08.440]   But I was told there was no changing
[02:30:08.440 --> 02:30:11.960]   of brain structure function in any meaningful way
[02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:14.760]   after age 25 or so.
[02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:16.720]   Turns out that's completely wrong.
[02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:21.560]   Sorry, David and Torsten, but they knew it was wrong.
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:23.300]   - Wow, that's interesting.
[02:30:23.300 --> 02:30:25.620]   - Yeah, it was actively suppressed
[02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:28.120]   because of the competitive nature of prizes
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:29.160]   and discoveries at that time.
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:32.480]   And a guy named Mike Merzenich and his student,
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:37.480]   Greg Reckenzone, were showing that adult plasticity exists.
[02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:41.600]   And only now is this really starting to emerge as a theme.
[02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:44.240]   Just crazy, like there were so many reasons
[02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:46.320]   and the textbook said it.
[02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:49.980]   We were all told it and it changed our behavior.
[02:30:49.980 --> 02:30:52.160]   Now we know this to be completely false.
[02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:54.300]   There's plasticity throughout the lifespan.
[02:30:54.300 --> 02:30:55.680]   There's limits to it here and there,
[02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:58.820]   but it's just far and away a different story.
[02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:01.740]   - So why would that be the only time that ever happened?
[02:31:01.740 --> 02:31:04.820]   - Exactly, but the field was run
[02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:07.440]   by a very small cabal of people at that time.
[02:31:07.440 --> 02:31:10.680]   - All fields are run by a very small cabal of people
[02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:14.300]   who have an investment in things being the way they are now
[02:31:14.300 --> 02:31:15.460]   because they're in charge.
[02:31:15.460 --> 02:31:18.380]   - And one of the great things about getting older is that,
[02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:21.040]   well, fortunately everyone eventually ages.
[02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:23.920]   And I hope that David unfortunately passed away.
[02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:26.360]   He was lovely, Torsten's lovely, he's still alive.
[02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:28.700]   And they would say, I think Torsten would say,
[02:31:28.700 --> 02:31:31.680]   "Yeah, we should have been a little more open or kind
[02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:33.760]   in allowing these other ideas."
[02:31:33.760 --> 02:31:35.040]   But I think that-
[02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:38.580]   - But just think about all the years that were wasted
[02:31:38.580 --> 02:31:41.520]   with this misunderstanding.
[02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:43.260]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:46.400]   And it went beyond that and there were BBC specials
[02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:47.720]   that helped propagate this.
[02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:51.160]   And one of the goals of the podcast has been to try
[02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:54.800]   and shine light on ideas that at first seemed crazy.
[02:31:54.800 --> 02:31:57.700]   Like I know you and I are both semi-obsessed
[02:31:57.700 --> 02:31:59.820]   with the health benefits of light.
[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:03.200]   And you hear about this stuff like negative ion therapy.
[02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:04.280]   It sounds crazy, right?
[02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:05.960]   Sounds like something you would only hear about
[02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:07.360]   at Esalen or in Big Sur.
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:10.940]   Turns out negative ionization therapy for sleep and mood
[02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:13.280]   is based on really amazing work out of Columbia
[02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:15.340]   by a guy named Michael Terman.
[02:32:15.340 --> 02:32:17.740]   The Nobel Prize, I think it was in 1916,
[02:32:17.740 --> 02:32:20.480]   was given for phototherapy for the treatment of lupus.
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:23.780]   Like this idea that certain wavelengths of light
[02:32:23.780 --> 02:32:27.300]   can help treat medical conditions is not a new idea.
[02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:29.320]   But somehow we see a red light.
[02:32:29.320 --> 02:32:32.160]   We're not used to seeing red lights except in sunsets
[02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:36.540]   and on stoplights, and somehow it bothers people
[02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:38.380]   or it makes them feel like-
[02:32:38.380 --> 02:32:43.380]   - Well, it undermines a business model
[02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:46.440]   that doesn't take red light into consideration.
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:51.240]   - Right, until it does, and then it's co-opted there.
[02:32:51.240 --> 02:32:53.900]   And the place that what I look to is acupuncture.
[02:32:53.900 --> 02:32:56.400]   For a lot of years, people said, well, acupuncture,
[02:32:56.400 --> 02:32:58.760]   this is like no mechanism, no mechanism, no mechanism.
[02:32:58.760 --> 02:33:01.400]   There's a lab at Harvard, a guy named Chufu Ma,
[02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:04.080]   who I know reasonably well, whose laboratory is dedicated
[02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:06.080]   to trying to figure out the biological mechanisms
[02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:06.920]   of acupuncture.
[02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:09.320]   And they are discovering what everyone has known
[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:12.000]   for thousands of years, which is that incredible effects
[02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:15.440]   on anti-inflammation, the gut microbiome.
[02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:16.640]   So-
[02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:21.520]   - I have a friend who was having a terrible back problem.
[02:33:21.520 --> 02:33:24.340]   And I suggested that he see an acupuncturist.
[02:33:24.340 --> 02:33:27.340]   And he went to the acupuncturist that I suggested,
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:30.920]   and his back problem completely healed,
[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:32.700]   almost instantaneously.
[02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:36.800]   And I asked him, have you been keeping up?
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:38.440]   'Cause he had another flare up.
[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:40.440]   He's like, no, I can't go back there
[02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:42.520]   because acupuncture doesn't work.
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:46.080]   I said, well, you saw it work for you.
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:48.400]   He's like, yeah, but there's no science.
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:49.580]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[02:33:49.580 --> 02:33:50.840]   - Oh, he's got it.
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:52.600]   Now there's good science.
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:55.600]   And published in premier journals,
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:56.760]   what's interesting is,
[02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:58.080]   this is a little bit of science editorial,
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:00.280]   but since we like to exchange information about health
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:04.000]   and things of that sort, the editorial staff of a journal
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.840]   dictates what gets published and what doesn't.
[02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:09.440]   And the premier journals have an outsized effect
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:11.040]   on what the media covers.
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:15.800]   And so the beautiful thing is the journal staff now
[02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:19.680]   is of the age that they grew up hearing about acupuncture.
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:23.660]   Hypnosis has a powerful clinical effect if it's done right.
[02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:26.840]   Yoga nidra and similar practices.
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:29.120]   And so the tides are changing,
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:31.720]   but I sometimes like to take a step back and think,
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:35.700]   what are we confronted with now that seems crazy
[02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:38.360]   that in 10 years, the kids that will be the,
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:41.160]   'cause to me they're kids, will be journal editors.
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:42.900]   Like, oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:44.760]   I'm making this up,
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:46.840]   but putting tuning forks against your head
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:47.680]   or something like that.
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:49.620]   Like sound wave therapy.
[02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:55.400]   I think when one adopts a stance of like,
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:58.220]   we have to filter everything
[02:34:58.220 --> 02:35:00.400]   through the limitations of our biology,
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:05.400]   but also through the sociology of like the way culture goes,
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:08.120]   it becomes a different story.
[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:09.640]   - How do you deal with that?
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:11.160]   Not just in terms of health,
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:14.780]   but in terms of thinking about anything.
[02:35:14.780 --> 02:35:16.720]   It sounds like you don't spend a whole lot of time
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:19.280]   thinking about what people are going to think is cool or not.
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:20.120]   - No, I can't.
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:21.280]   - You're punk rocker at heart.
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:22.120]   - Yes.
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:22.960]   - You still are.
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:24.320]   - Yes, I can't.
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:26.880]   I just know what I like and what I don't.
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:29.360]   I know what works for me and what doesn't.
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:33.540]   I try things and I'm constantly looking for new,
[02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:35.760]   better solutions to anything.
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:37.440]   And wherever they come from, it doesn't matter.
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:40.320]   It could come from Stanford,
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:43.640]   or it could come from the guy talking to himself
[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:44.800]   on the street.
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:46.760]   If it works, I'm good.
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:48.640]   It doesn't really matter to me at all.
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:53.640]   I don't hold any of it tightly.
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:56.480]   - Well, fortunately there's now a division
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:35:57.800]   of the National Institutes of Health
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:01.500]   called Complementary and Alternative Health.
[02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:03.920]   And it's amazing.
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:07.960]   And CCIH is run by a woman who has published on,
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:09.920]   this is interesting,
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:14.920]   some of the anti-cancer effects of things like acupuncture.
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:19.840]   Not that acupuncture can cure all cancers,
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:24.840]   but real data that I think for a lot of people,
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:29.320]   certainly of the generation above us,
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:31.820]   they just are not interested.
[02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:35.760]   It sheds new light on the Andrew Wiles,
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:40.000]   the Paul Stanmetses, the wild ones.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.380]   - Ozone therapy, or there's so many,
[02:36:43.380 --> 02:36:44.640]   there's so many we can look at.
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:46.280]   I mean, for a long time,
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:48.520]   nutrition was just thought of as something
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:50.600]   that doesn't matter what you eat.
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:53.700]   It's what medicine you take and what,
[02:36:53.700 --> 02:36:58.060]   it's like the food is everything.
[02:36:58.060 --> 02:37:01.620]   - Food is a powerful variable.
[02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:04.320]   In the landscape of online nutrition,
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:07.560]   it's sort of one of the third rails for anyone like myself
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:09.000]   who's out there on social media.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.320]   You do a very good job of putting out posts on Twitter
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:14.880]   and Instagram, but each day you take it down,
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:15.880]   you put up a new one.
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:16.960]   - And I don't talk about any,
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:20.000]   I only talk about, I talk about creative ideas.
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.720]   I don't talk about anything specific related to anything
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:30.360]   other than maybe something like don't believe what you hear.
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:31.360]   - Right, exactly.
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:33.640]   Well, in the landscape of nutrition,
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:36.480]   sometimes I now place it through the filter
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:37.620]   of professional wrestling.
[02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:40.480]   You've got your vegans and your omnivores
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:45.480]   and your carnivore MD, and you've got liver king,
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:47.960]   and you've got everything in between, right?
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:51.020]   So you could translate that
[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:52.740]   to any number of different areas.
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:54.320]   Fashion probably has its people.
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:55.260]   I'm just not aware of where they are.
[02:37:55.260 --> 02:37:58.400]   Music has theirs, and sports has theirs,
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:00.960]   and science has theirs, characters.
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:05.760]   So are we all just pro wrestling like characters
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:07.040]   in these different domains,
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:10.520]   and we're taking ourselves and each other way too seriously?
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:12.880]   - Yeah, it's all, we don't know anything.
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:15.360]   It's all, if someone has an idea
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:17.100]   and it sounds interesting to you, try it,
[02:38:17.100 --> 02:38:20.040]   and if it doesn't work, it's okay, try something else.
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:21.080]   - You're an empiricist.
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:23.480]   - Yeah, whatever works, whatever works.
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:27.040]   And if something seems interesting to you
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:28.240]   and you're excited by it,
[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:29.420]   why not try it?
[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:32.680]   It's, you know, I try very fringy things.
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:37.680]   I like, in some ways, the more unrealistic it seems,
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:41.600]   the more interesting it is to me,
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:43.480]   because I feel like that's getting closer
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:48.480]   to something that somebody doesn't want me to know, you know?
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:51.920]   - But you're not a big drug guy,
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:54.600]   like the big psychedelic craze that's happening now
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:56.680]   and that happened some years back.
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:58.600]   - I'm not against it, it just has never been
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:38:59.760]   something that I've done.
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:02.440]   - Yeah, yeah, it's an interesting area
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:04.640]   that's definitely making its headway
[02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:08.120]   inside of standard academic science and medicine now.
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:15.680]   - I'm interested in non-formological approaches to things,
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:16.800]   whatever they are.
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:19.000]   - Well, I'm a big believer that also
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.880]   that behavioral dos and don'ts first are the,
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:24.760]   they're the most fun to explore,
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:27.760]   because in general, unless it's something like, you know,
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:30.400]   jumping between buildings, doing parkour or something,
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:33.460]   most of the time you're not going to injure or harm yourself.
[02:39:33.460 --> 02:39:35.300]   There's more room for iteration
[02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:37.200]   than there is with a pill or a potion.
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:41.200]   Although, you know, certainly pharmacology has its place.
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:46.440]   So you've had creative works,
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:48.040]   certainly within the realm of music,
[02:39:48.040 --> 02:39:52.240]   also comedy and producing film and other things.
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:57.080]   For somebody out there who of whatever age that they,
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:39:59.840]   maybe they're creating, maybe they're,
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:02.960]   they know they have this creative antennae.
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:04.960]   Not, the source is outside.
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:07.480]   What was it that Strummer said?
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:09.820]   I actually wrote this on the wall of my laboratory.
[02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:11.960]   No input, no output.
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:13.520]   That's Strummer's law.
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:14.740]   It's written in my laboratory.
[02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:16.520]   The people in my lab were so like, what's going on here?
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:18.240]   I think one guy knew what that was,
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:20.700]   but it was a picture of him and picture of my bulldog
[02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:22.620]   and, you know, no input, no output.
[02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:25.920]   I don't think I can just stay in a room with four walls
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:27.780]   and a ceiling and nothing else and create.
[02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:29.080]   I mean, I know that there are a certain number
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:32.440]   of things in here, but I do think accessing the world
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:33.280]   is important.
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:34.820]   - And the world is giving us clues all the time
[02:40:34.820 --> 02:40:35.900]   if we're paying attention.
[02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:36.900]   That's another part of it.
[02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:38.940]   Like, if you're paying attention,
[02:40:38.940 --> 02:40:43.180]   the thing that you are looking for
[02:40:43.180 --> 02:40:48.420]   is being either whispered or screamed at you
[02:40:48.420 --> 02:40:51.720]   in the outside world, if you're paying attention.
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:57.080]   - Well, and I forget the exact title of the chapter,
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:01.380]   but there's a chapter about staying open to clues
[02:41:01.380 --> 02:41:05.780]   or being on the lookout for clues.
[02:41:05.780 --> 02:41:09.560]   Now I feel tempted to look for the exact title
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:10.760]   of that chapter, but-
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:12.380]   - It's probably "Look for Clues" is my guess.
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:14.440]   - "Look for Clues" sounds like it sounds right.
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:17.560]   And since you wrote it, I'm guessing that's right.
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:21.760]   So do you think there are clues in everywhere?
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:24.360]   - Yes, I think there are clues everywhere.
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:27.780]   If we pay attention, we'll hear a phrase,
[02:41:27.780 --> 02:41:32.780]   we'll trigger a thought, we'll see something unexpected.
[02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:38.660]   If someone recommends something to you,
[02:41:38.660 --> 02:41:40.240]   maybe it's a coincidence.
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:42.360]   If three people recommend the same thing to you,
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:44.320]   maybe it's not, you know, who knows?
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:46.520]   Who knows?
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:52.520]   I do believe the universe is on the side of creativity
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:42:00.440]   and the universe is supporting things to happen
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:02.460]   and they can happen through you
[02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:04.780]   or they could happen through someone else.
[02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:07.280]   So if you're paying attention,
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:08.840]   maybe it'll happen through you.
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:12.560]   - We had a guest on the podcast named Justin Sonnenberg.
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:14.600]   He's an expert in the gut microbiome
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:17.440]   and he applied something that, without knowing,
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:21.460]   he applied the opposite principle,
[02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:23.360]   the opposite is true principle.
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:25.900]   We were talking about these trillions of gut microbiota
[02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:27.480]   that clearly are doing amazing things
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:30.020]   to create our transmitters and govern our brain
[02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:31.800]   and even decision-making,
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:35.520]   how much sugar is in our system, driving appetite, et cetera.
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:38.480]   And he said, you know, we think of them as cargo,
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:42.720]   but like maybe we're just vehicles and they're in charge,
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:44.040]   that all of our interactions,
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:45.760]   like every time we shake hands or touch our eyes,
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:47.840]   we're exchanging gut microbiota.
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:52.280]   And we think of intelligence as thinking and intelligence.
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:54.360]   And he's a microbiologist.
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:58.040]   And in all seriousness, he said,
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:00.260]   maybe we're the ones being manipulated.
[02:43:00.260 --> 02:43:01.560]   We're the house cats.
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:02.640]   And we think here we are,
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:04.800]   we're falling in love and kissing and shaking hands
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:07.960]   and washing hands and doing all sorts of things
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:09.920]   to isolate or connect with one another.
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:11.320]   And maybe the gut microbiota
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:13.720]   are really trying to optimize their survival.
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:17.520]   - That's what Laird Hamilton said that at one point
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:19.840]   in the sauna, that when you're in the sauna
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:21.120]   and it's really hot,
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:24.920]   the feeling that you have of wanting to get out
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:30.920]   could be the bad critters in your body that can't handle it.
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:31.920]   - Let's get out of here.
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:36.920]   - Are trying to convince you from the inside to get out.
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:39.000]   Maybe that's where that feeling
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.360]   of being compelled to get out comes from.
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:45.580]   So Elon getting us all to Mars might be a bit of,
[02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:47.620]   maybe they just want to get to Mars.
[02:43:47.620 --> 02:43:50.120]   And so they're- - Or maybe.
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:51.120]   - 'Cause I'm starting to feel
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:54.000]   like I'm channeling Lex Friedman here for a moment.
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.800]   No, I think this considering the opposite is really key.
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:43:58.680]   And while it might sound mystical to people
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:01.000]   or a little bit like we're just playing with ideas,
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.460]   it's exactly what you do in science.
[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:06.160]   Someone walks in with a result and says, I found this,
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:07.000]   this is true.
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.520]   And you say, but what if it's all something else?
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:11.220]   A good example might be here I'm pulling
[02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:13.400]   from podcast episodes that we've had,
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:16.680]   but Alia Crum is this amazing psychologist
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:18.720]   who works on belief effects.
[02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:21.360]   Your knowledge strongly shapes the physiological outcome.
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:25.500]   And she had this amazing graduate thesis where she said,
[02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:28.920]   what if all of exercise is placebo?
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:29.740]   All of it.
[02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:32.120]   Yeah, it burns some calories and does some things.
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:33.240]   Turns out this isn't the case,
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:35.800]   but it turns out a lot of the effects of exercise,
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:37.480]   positive effects, lowering blood pressure,
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:40.160]   relieving stress, positive or placebo.
[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:43.180]   But nobody thinks of it like that
[02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:46.440]   because we're so attached to calories burned, et cetera.
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:51.240]   - I think that's a big point that the belief part of it
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:56.240]   is a huge part of the conversation about everything.
[02:44:56.240 --> 02:44:58.700]   What we believe has power.
[02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:01.160]   If we believe we could make something great,
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:03.960]   the chances of us making something great are better
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:06.640]   than if we don't believe we can.
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:11.640]   So I would say any ability to harness your belief
[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:15.380]   on your behalf is a really healthy thing to do.
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:20.320]   - And one thing that you make very clear is that
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:23.440]   while our own abilities may come into question
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:27.480]   from time to time, you absolutely believe
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:32.120]   that the elements from which to create are out there.
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:33.380]   - Absolutely.
[02:45:33.380 --> 02:45:36.340]   All the elements are here.
[02:45:36.340 --> 02:45:37.960]   Everything is here.
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:39.060]   We get to pick and choose.
[02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:43.420]   We get the conveyor belts going by with the little gifts
[02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:48.420]   and we can, first we have to notice there's a conveyor belt.
[02:45:48.420 --> 02:45:52.580]   Then we notice the gifts and then that's the starting point.
[02:45:52.580 --> 02:45:56.020]   And then we may even feel empowered enough
[02:45:56.020 --> 02:45:59.820]   to grab one of the gifts and open it up
[02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:01.460]   and see what's inside.
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:04.380]   And then maybe that started something really beautiful
[02:46:04.380 --> 02:46:06.840]   that we wouldn't have done.
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:11.840]   Everything that I make or have made
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:18.580]   has always been based on something that I see or hear
[02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:23.940]   that allows me to see something that I didn't see before.
[02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:27.120]   - So I was going to ask you whether or not
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:30.140]   it's important to be happy in order to create,
[02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:32.100]   but certainly a lot of people that were unhappy
[02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:33.660]   were still able to create.
[02:46:33.660 --> 02:46:35.760]   But the more I listen to you,
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:39.820]   it seems that it's really about an ability to pay attention.
[02:46:39.820 --> 02:46:40.660]   - Yes.
[02:46:40.660 --> 02:46:43.940]   - So if I'm unhappy or if I'm happy,
[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:46.220]   may not be as relevant as whether or not
[02:46:46.220 --> 02:46:49.040]   I'm able to stay undistracted.
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:50.060]   - Yes.
[02:46:50.060 --> 02:46:54.140]   I would say that's, I would say being able to stay present
[02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:59.140]   in the work is probably the most important part of it.
[02:46:59.460 --> 02:47:04.460]   And how you feel is less of an issue unless how you feel
[02:47:04.460 --> 02:47:08.900]   gets in the way of you feeling how the work makes you feel.
[02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:11.260]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:13.300]   If you're in a lot of pain
[02:47:13.300 --> 02:47:16.820]   and you're looking at a piece of art,
[02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:20.140]   it may be hard to know how that art makes you feel
[02:47:20.140 --> 02:47:24.440]   because the big signal in your body is the physical pain.
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:27.260]   I'm sure there are some people who can do that too,
[02:47:27.260 --> 02:47:29.860]   who can even through the physical pain can feel it.
[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:34.380]   - There's this idea of transmutation of taking one emotion
[02:47:34.380 --> 02:47:38.380]   and contorting it and co-opting it into another action
[02:47:38.380 --> 02:47:39.900]   in an adaptive way.
[02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:43.220]   But this idea of distraction being a problem,
[02:47:43.220 --> 02:47:44.260]   this really resonates.
[02:47:44.260 --> 02:47:46.780]   I think when I think of times of great productivity
[02:47:46.780 --> 02:47:49.420]   is when I was able to be undistracted.
[02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:52.040]   I could also see how success can be its own distraction.
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:55.020]   This is often discussed in the context of fighting sports
[02:47:55.020 --> 02:47:56.520]   where someone starts making a lot of money
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:47:58.500]   and pretty soon their focus becomes all the things
[02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:00.220]   they can access with their success,
[02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:01.500]   as opposed to the thing that got them there
[02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:02.560]   in the first place.
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:07.240]   Keeping an underdog mentality.
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:08.420]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:10.400]   Before we conclude, I do want to ask you
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:14.440]   about one other aspect of process, which is meditation.
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:17.240]   Meditation is interesting to me
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:19.260]   because when we close our eyes,
[02:48:19.260 --> 02:48:20.740]   as most meditations are done,
[02:48:20.740 --> 02:48:25.500]   and we focus on our brain, our brain has no sensation.
[02:48:25.500 --> 02:48:26.520]   Like if we- - I wouldn't say
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:27.720]   we focus on our brain.
[02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:29.600]   - Oh, or we focus on something
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:31.840]   other than our normal experience.
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:34.240]   How would you define meditation?
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:38.200]   - Well, there are different types of meditation.
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:42.880]   Usually, either way,
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:44.980]   I would say there's no form of meditation
[02:48:44.980 --> 02:48:46.600]   where we're focused on our brain.
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:49.580]   - Okay, good, I'm glad we disagree.
[02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:51.520]   - I would say here are the things that happen.
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:55.900]   We either are engaging in a mantra,
[02:48:55.900 --> 02:48:59.900]   which would be a version of almost like
[02:48:59.900 --> 02:49:02.700]   creating a trance for ourselves,
[02:49:02.700 --> 02:49:05.760]   not unlike listening to something when we go to sleep
[02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:08.460]   that would distract our conscious mind
[02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:11.940]   from participating.
[02:49:11.940 --> 02:49:16.940]   We would be overriding the talking mind
[02:49:16.940 --> 02:49:20.520]   with just a sound that we're generating,
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:23.740]   or a word, or a phrase, series of phrases.
[02:49:23.740 --> 02:49:28.480]   A meta meditation is a loving kindness meditation
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:31.040]   with phrases, could be that.
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:33.320]   Or it could be focused on the breath.
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:35.960]   But the purpose of being focused on the breath
[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:40.960]   is to not hear the self-talk that we normally have.
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:47.920]   It's a single pointed focus exercise
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:49.160]   in those that I described.
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:52.440]   The other version is an awareness meditation
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:54.800]   where you're closing your eyes
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:59.800]   and you're being with whatever is and noticing.
[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:03.760]   So if we were to do it now,
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:05.880]   and you could do it eyes open or eyes closed
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:08.240]   with an awareness practice.
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:11.420]   But the first thing that I would do is I would feel,
[02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:14.920]   I feel a little ringing in my ears.
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:18.360]   It might be from the electronic equipment around us,
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:20.140]   and I don't mean that I hear the sound.
[02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:23.200]   It's like a vibration.
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:26.200]   I hear cars passing in the distance.
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:29.780]   See what else comes up.
[02:50:29.780 --> 02:50:35.660]   I can feel a feeling in my chest.
[02:50:35.660 --> 02:50:43.920]   I can feel this part of my face, not sure why.
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:52.920]   Feels like it's related to my jaw, more car sounds.
[02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:57.460]   I'm aware of a little feeling of warmth.
[02:50:57.460 --> 02:51:02.760]   So now I would say the room feels a bit warm.
[02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:04.000]   I wasn't aware of that before
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:07.240]   when I wasn't just being with what's happening.
[02:51:07.240 --> 02:51:10.760]   Feel a little itch on my left shoulder.
[02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:16.400]   So that would be an awareness practice,
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:17.840]   which is another kind of meditation
[02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:20.880]   where you're just paying attention to what's going on.
[02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:21.840]   There's no story.
[02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:25.380]   There's no this means this, none of those things.
[02:51:25.380 --> 02:51:29.140]   Just like an inventory almost
[02:51:29.140 --> 02:51:32.200]   of everything that comes up when it comes up,
[02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:34.400]   and you do that for a period of time.
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:36.600]   But in all of those cases,
[02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:39.720]   in the example of doing the awareness meditation
[02:51:39.720 --> 02:51:43.700]   or doing a mantra meditation or focusing on the breath,
[02:51:43.700 --> 02:51:46.740]   in none of them am I thinking,
[02:51:46.740 --> 02:51:49.200]   in none of them am I concentrating on,
[02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:56.540]   I'm being aware of sense perceptions in the awareness one,
[02:51:56.540 --> 02:52:03.980]   or in the other meditations, I'm doing a practice
[02:52:03.980 --> 02:52:08.280]   so that I'm not aware of thinking about anything else.
[02:52:08.280 --> 02:52:09.520]   - When did you start meditating
[02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:12.180]   and how often do you meditate now?
[02:52:12.180 --> 02:52:15.540]   - I learned when I was 14 and I started with TM,
[02:52:15.540 --> 02:52:17.560]   and that's probably the meditation
[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:20.600]   that I've done the most in my life, and I come back to,
[02:52:20.600 --> 02:52:23.480]   although I tried many different kinds
[02:52:23.480 --> 02:52:26.600]   and also different physical forms of meditation,
[02:52:26.600 --> 02:52:28.480]   Tai Chi, things like that.
[02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:31.520]   I meditated for five or six years,
[02:52:31.520 --> 02:52:36.240]   and then I stopped when I went to school to university,
[02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:38.780]   and then I started again several years later.
[02:52:38.780 --> 02:52:39.760]   And when I started again,
[02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:43.600]   I realized how profound it was in me
[02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:45.760]   that I had done it when I did it.
[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:50.760]   So I usually have some sort of a practice.
[02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:56.340]   In some ways, the beach walks could be a form of meditation,
[02:52:56.340 --> 02:53:01.720]   but for me, typically I would wake up,
[02:53:01.720 --> 02:53:03.560]   it'd be the first thing I would do
[02:53:03.560 --> 02:53:06.440]   during that sort of in-between time,
[02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:10.080]   maybe go out in the sun, close my eyes and meditate
[02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:12.280]   before starting my day.
[02:53:13.380 --> 02:53:14.680]   If I'm doing it twice a day,
[02:53:14.680 --> 02:53:17.840]   the second time would probably be right before dinner,
[02:53:17.840 --> 02:53:20.700]   if I'm doing it on a regular schedule.
[02:53:20.700 --> 02:53:23.940]   Then if I find myself on an airplane,
[02:53:23.940 --> 02:53:27.320]   I might meditate for an hour or for the,
[02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:30.700]   I can remember one time meditating the entire flight
[02:53:30.700 --> 02:53:31.780]   from New York to LA,
[02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:35.820]   just was a great opportunity to do a deep dive.
[02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:38.980]   And time passes, you lose track of time,
[02:53:38.980 --> 02:53:40.480]   you know, you don't even know.
[02:53:41.920 --> 02:53:43.560]   It's like going to sleep and waking up.
[02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:45.780]   You don't feel like that was eight hours.
[02:53:45.780 --> 02:53:49.480]   You know, it's just time stops.
[02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:54.280]   Not always, but when it does, it's a great feeling.
[02:53:54.280 --> 02:53:56.300]   - Yeah, you've sent me some meditations
[02:53:56.300 --> 02:53:58.600]   including the one that you did on that trans-Atlantic,
[02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:00.120]   or transcontinental flight.
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:04.020]   And I've been trying to do longer and longer meditations,
[02:54:04.020 --> 02:54:06.580]   but I've always meditated a little bit,
[02:54:06.580 --> 02:54:08.320]   but your meditation practice is one
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:09.620]   that I'm starting to adopt.
[02:54:09.620 --> 02:54:13.100]   If maybe we could convince you to give us suggestions
[02:54:13.100 --> 02:54:15.540]   of one or two and we can link out to them for listeners.
[02:54:15.540 --> 02:54:16.720]   I'm sure they'd appreciate that.
[02:54:16.720 --> 02:54:21.020]   - And there's also meditation-like practices to do
[02:54:21.020 --> 02:54:24.600]   that involve, like there's something called
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:29.600]   the Surgical Series from the Monroe Institute,
[02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:34.300]   which I used when I had a surgery.
[02:54:34.300 --> 02:54:36.420]   You listen to this recording
[02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:41.420]   and it both allows your body to heal much faster
[02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:46.540]   and remove some of the trauma that goes on
[02:54:46.540 --> 02:54:50.840]   when getting cut open, it's traumatic.
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:56.260]   But just through listening to certain things,
[02:54:56.260 --> 02:55:00.860]   you can have a really powerful effect, heal much faster.
[02:55:00.860 --> 02:55:05.860]   I remember I was about to be put under
[02:55:06.740 --> 02:55:11.620]   for a surgery and my eyes were closed
[02:55:11.620 --> 02:55:16.620]   and I wasn't communicating with anyone there
[02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:21.740]   because I was going inside and my wife was with me
[02:55:21.740 --> 02:55:23.620]   and they came in and they said,
[02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:26.720]   "Oh, so they already gave Rick the sedative
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:28.100]   "because he's ready to wheel in."
[02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:29.620]   She's like, "I didn't give him anything."
[02:55:29.620 --> 02:55:31.980]   He's like, "But look at his numbers."
[02:55:31.980 --> 02:55:32.940]   Yeah. (laughs)
[02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:34.340]   - I love it.
[02:55:34.340 --> 02:55:37.980]   - Yeah, it's an amazingly powerful practice.
[02:55:37.980 --> 02:55:41.060]   I like 'cause anyone can cultivate Chanel.
[02:55:41.060 --> 02:55:43.580]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:55:43.580 --> 02:55:45.980]   And there's no good or bad version.
[02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:49.360]   It really is just if you learn a technique
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:52.100]   and show up and do it, it works.
[02:55:52.100 --> 02:55:56.340]   - Well, I love that you're so willing to share
[02:55:56.340 --> 02:55:58.060]   what you do and your process.
[02:55:58.060 --> 02:56:00.400]   And listen, I just wanna say thank you
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:02.100]   for a number of things.
[02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:05.740]   I wanna thank you for the music you've created
[02:56:05.740 --> 02:56:07.280]   and that you are to create
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:09.720]   because we're gonna be still ongoing,
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:12.460]   certainly for your time today
[02:56:12.460 --> 02:56:14.740]   and sharing your thought process
[02:56:14.740 --> 02:56:16.660]   and a bit of what goes into
[02:56:16.660 --> 02:56:19.100]   this incredible creative process.
[02:56:19.100 --> 02:56:21.340]   And I wanna thank you for writing the book.
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:24.160]   I don't talk about or feature many books on the podcast.
[02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:26.320]   It's just not something we typically do,
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:29.700]   but I've seen a little bit of the evolution of it
[02:56:29.700 --> 02:56:30.980]   and then I've seen it now
[02:56:30.980 --> 02:56:34.140]   and read through it in its final form twice, as I mentioned.
[02:56:34.140 --> 02:56:36.360]   And I'm going to continue to read through it again.
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:39.820]   It is one of those books where it is so filled with gems,
[02:56:39.820 --> 02:56:41.300]   like every chapter,
[02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:43.280]   like I could take notes on this and take notes on this.
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:47.100]   And it's assembled in a very digestible way
[02:56:47.100 --> 02:56:52.100]   that allows people to extract the meaningful parts
[02:56:52.100 --> 02:56:53.660]   in every chapter.
[02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:56.760]   And there are so many in a way that's very straightforward.
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:56:58.700]   So I love the book.
[02:56:58.700 --> 02:56:59.720]   So thank you for doing it
[02:56:59.720 --> 02:57:02.860]   because you certainly didn't have to write a book,
[02:57:02.860 --> 02:57:04.840]   but I'm so happy that you did.
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:07.200]   And I know that I've already benefited.
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:08.840]   I know so many people are going to benefit.
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:10.060]   It's an amazing book
[02:57:10.060 --> 02:57:12.240]   and I couldn't help but put my neuroscience lens on it.
[02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:14.320]   But I also, about halfway through,
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:18.400]   I learned to discard my preexisting lens a bit
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:20.080]   and start to see things
[02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:22.100]   through what I think is a different perspective.
[02:57:22.100 --> 02:57:23.040]   So I just wanna thank you
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:24.860]   for being such an incredible portal
[02:57:24.860 --> 02:57:27.260]   and also for being an amazing friend.
[02:57:27.260 --> 02:57:28.100]   - Thank you.
[02:57:28.100 --> 02:57:28.920]   I love you.
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:29.900]   I'm happy to be here with you.
[02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:32.300]   And anytime I get to see you, it's a good day.
[02:57:32.300 --> 02:57:33.360]   - Likewise.
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:34.460]   Thank you for joining me today
[02:57:34.460 --> 02:57:36.280]   for my discussion with Rick Rubin,
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:39.320]   all about creativity and the creative process.
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:41.540]   Please also be sure to check out his new book,
[02:57:41.540 --> 02:57:44.340]   "The Creative Act, A Way of Being" by Rick Rubin.
[02:57:44.340 --> 02:57:45.380]   As I mentioned earlier,
[02:57:45.380 --> 02:57:48.500]   it's an incredible book and such a wealth of knowledge
[02:57:48.500 --> 02:57:50.100]   for you creative types out there,
[02:57:50.100 --> 02:57:51.860]   for those of you that seek to be more creative
[02:57:51.860 --> 02:57:54.660]   or to understand the creative process generally.
[02:57:54.660 --> 02:57:57.060]   And as I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[02:57:57.060 --> 02:57:58.860]   Rick has very generously offered
[02:57:58.860 --> 02:58:00.780]   to answer your questions about creativity.
[02:58:00.780 --> 02:58:03.900]   So if you have questions for Rick Rubin about creativity
[02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:06.720]   or the creative process or anything else for that matter,
[02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:09.240]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube
[02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:11.980]   by writing in capital letters, question for Rick Rubin,
[02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:13.440]   and then please put the question there.
[02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:15.700]   That will make it easier for me to find those questions.
[02:58:15.700 --> 02:58:17.180]   I will record the conversation
[02:58:17.180 --> 02:58:18.940]   where I ask Rick those questions.
[02:58:18.940 --> 02:58:21.980]   And of course, we will post his answers to those questions
[02:58:21.980 --> 02:58:24.460]   on our Huberman Lab Clips channel.

[02:58:50.820 --> 02:58:52.760]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[02:58:52.760 --> 02:58:55.180]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:58:55.180 --> 02:58:56.700]   Not so much during today's episode,
[02:58:56.700 --> 02:58:59.220]   but on many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:58:59.220 --> 02:59:00.380]   we discuss supplements.
[02:59:00.380 --> 02:59:02.540]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:59:02.540 --> 02:59:04.600]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:59:04.600 --> 02:59:07.480]   for things like enhancing the depth and quality of sleep,
[02:59:07.480 --> 02:59:10.020]   for enhancing focus and for hormone support,
[02:59:10.020 --> 02:59:11.700]   and many other aspects of mental health,
[02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:13.300]   physical health, and performance.
[02:59:13.300 --> 02:59:15.180]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce
[02:59:15.180 --> 02:59:17.660]   that we are now partnered with Momentus supplements
[02:59:17.660 --> 02:59:20.340]   because Momentus supplements are of the very highest quality,
[02:59:20.340 --> 02:59:21.660]   they ship internationally,
[02:59:21.660 --> 02:59:24.180]   and they have single ingredient formulations,
[02:59:24.180 --> 02:59:25.340]   which turns out to be important
[02:59:25.340 --> 02:59:27.640]   if you're going to develop the most cost-effective
[02:59:27.640 --> 02:59:30.180]   and biologically effective supplementation regimen.
[02:59:30.180 --> 02:59:31.540]   If you'd like to access the supplements
[02:59:31.540 --> 02:59:33.460]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:59:33.460 --> 02:59:35.700]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[02:59:35.700 --> 02:59:38.640]   so livemomentus.com/huberman.

[02:59:46.740 --> 02:59:47.900]   and science-related tools,
[02:59:47.900 --> 02:59:49.500]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:59:49.500 --> 02:59:50.940]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:59:50.940 --> 02:59:53.180]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:59:53.180 --> 02:59:54.300]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

[03:00:08.500 --> 03:00:11.660]   as well as toolkits for things like enhancing your sleep,
[03:00:11.660 --> 03:00:13.920]   enhancing your focus and ability to learn,
[03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:16.200]   hormone support, fitness, and on and on.
