[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   We apologise for the poor quality of the following recording of a sermon
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.320]   by the late Dr Martin Lloyd Jones. Although we have digitally restored this to improve clarity,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.760]   the quality is not as good as we would like. We do apologise for this but nevertheless
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.440]   hope that this sermon will be a great encouragement and a blessing to you.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.440]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in Paul's
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.240]   epistle to the Ephesians in the first chapter and the third verse.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.880]   The third verse in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.840]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.200]   who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.440]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.760]   all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:16.000]   Now that of course is one of these glorious, staggering statements which are to be found in
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.640]   such profusion in the writings of this great apostle. Nothing perhaps is more characteristic
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.680]   of his style as a writer than just that, the frequency with which he seems to state the whole
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.680]   gospel in a phrase or in a verse. He never tires of doing it, he goes on doing it, he says the same
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.080]   thing in different ways. And this surely is one of the most glorious, even of his statements,
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.200]   and therefore it is one of those statements that brings us face to face with the profundities
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.960]   of the Christian faith. Now it's one of those phrases which I always feel
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.880]   we have to be very careful with as we handle it. The danger of course with a statement like this
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.040]   is that we may be so charmed and enraptured by it, by the very sound of the words and the very
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.720]   arrangement of the words, that we are content with some passing general effect and never take
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.160]   the trouble to analyze it and thereby to discover exactly what it says. The danger of course with
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.800]   a statement like this is just to intone it, and if you just intone it, well, you'll be content
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:51.840]   with a general effect. It almost persuades you to intone it, doesn't it? It's such a magnificent
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.480]   statement. It gives one great pleasure just to utter the words and to repeat them, and one may
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:07.040]   thus I say be content with a purely general or aesthetic effect. And of course if that does
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.440]   happen to us, we shall be missing something of this tremendous richness that is to be found
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.960]   in this statement. Therefore it behoves us, especially with these resounding statements
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.680]   like this, to be unusually careful to examine them and to dissect them, to analyze them,
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   to open them out, to question them, and to discover exactly what is the meaning and the content of
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.000]   almost every word. And we must do this very especially in the light of the whole teaching
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.560]   of the scripture everywhere. Now then, what exactly is the apostle saying here? Well,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.480]   the first thing we have to do of course is to observe its context. It's the third verse. It
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.800]   comes after the first and the second. Obvious, isn't it? And yet I feel sure that were we to
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.320]   turn this into a catechizing meeting and to ask the question of why exactly does this come in the
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.720]   third place rather than the first, some of us might find it rather difficult to answer the question.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.720]   Well, the connection is this, isn't it? First of all, the apostle has reminded these Ephesian
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   Christians of who they are and what they are. He did that in the first verse.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.120]   Then in the second verse he has gone on to offer a kind of prayer for them.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.840]   Having reminded them of who they are and what they are, he then
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.280]   reminds them of what is open to them as Christians, because they are what they are.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.360]   Or, if you prefer it, he has gone on to remind them of the things that as Christians they can
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:54.640]   enjoy and should be enjoying and should seek to enjoy. Grace and peace from God our Father
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:01.760]   and from the Lord Jesus Christ. And having done all that, he now goes on to this.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.680]   He is now concerned to remind them of how they have ever become what they are
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.400]   and of how it is at all possible for them to enjoy these priceless blessings of grace and of peace.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.200]   That's the connection. Again, you see, we must emphasize the fact that this preliminary
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.000]   salutation isn't mere formality. It's full of that logic that always characterized these men.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.080]   What a perfect example of that we had in that third chapter of the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.040]   The argument, the sequence, one thing following another.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.520]   The apostle can't help doing that. He always does it and he's doing it here.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.040]   That's what you are. You're saints, you're faithful, you're in Christ.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:54.320]   Because of that, you can be enjoying grace and peace from God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.280]   Yes, but how is all this possible to you? What's made it possible?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.640]   And the answer is to be found here at once in this third verse.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.480]   Now, there is a sense in which we can say quite rightly and truthfully that
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.800]   this third verse really is the great central message of the whole epistle.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.640]   This is the thing that, in a sense, he is concerned to do. That's why he ever wrote his letter.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.160]   He desires these Christian people to come to an understanding of just that.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:37.040]   He'll say this many times in many different ways. He's praying for them.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.360]   He says that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, what for?
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.880]   That you may know what is the hope of your calling, etc.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.400]   The great theme is this understanding.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.160]   He wants them to realize how they are what they are and how they're open to these great blessings.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.200]   He says, "I want you to have an understanding of it all."
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.920]   In other words, the theme here is the plan of salvation, the way of salvation.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.520]   This tremendous process that puts us where we are
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.040]   and opens us to all these things that God has for us.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.720]   Now, the apostle does this, I say, because
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.680]   he wants these Ephesian Christians and others to arrive at that understanding.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.800]   And he wants them to arrive at that understanding that they may enter into their heritage,
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.400]   that they may enjoy the Christian life as they should,
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.160]   and that they may live lives to the praise of the glory of God.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.800]   And, of course, exactly the same thing applies to us.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.800]   Whether we know it or not, my friends, our main trouble as Christians today
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.760]   is still a lack of understanding, a lack of knowledge.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.640]   No, not a lack of knowledge superficially of the scriptures,
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.480]   but a lack of knowledge of the doctrines of the scriptures.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.040]   And it is because of our fatal lack at that point
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.640]   that there are so many other deficiencies in our Christian lives.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.600]   The chief need, according to this epistle,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.880]   is that the eyes of our understanding may be wide open.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.680]   Not simply that we may enjoy the Christian life and its experiences,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.360]   but that we may understand.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.280]   Because the more we understand, the more we shall experience.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.120]   It's a lack of knowledge that's always troubled God's people.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.640]   It's the great message of the book of the prophet Hosea in the Old Testament.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.640]   He says the trouble there with the people is that
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.840]   my people, says God, are lost because of lack of understanding, lack of knowledge.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.080]   It was the whole trouble with the children of Israel from beginning to end.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.240]   They would not realize who they were and what they were and why they were what they were.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.120]   It was a lack of knowledge all along.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.240]   If only they'd known these things, they would never have wandered away from God.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.480]   They would never have turned to idols.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.960]   They would have never sought to be like the other nations.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.200]   It was this fatal lack of knowledge.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.160]   And the New Testament is full of the same teaching.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:24.400]   Very well then, we must consider this verse very carefully.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:31.120]   Because here the apostle, I say, displays before us this knowledge,
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.000]   this doctrine which leads us into an understanding of what we are.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.880]   Let me try to subdivide it in terms of the following principles.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.240]   I take it in the order in which it's presented to us by the apostle.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.920]   The first proposition, therefore, must be this,
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:58.560]   that the realization of the truth concerning our redemption always leads to prayers.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.800]   You notice how it bursts forth.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.120]   Think of it, if you like, in terms of an orchestra.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   There stands the conductor already and hears this tremendous burst
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.240]   with all the power and the magnificence.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:14.880]   "Blessed!"
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.640]   It was the sort of thing, of course, that Handel seems to have understood so well.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.800]   It's the characteristic, is it not, of some of his greatest choruses.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.680]   Think of the opening of "Worthy is the Lamb," that first note.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.680]   Well, that's the kind of thing you have here.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.320]   "Blessed!"
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:42.480]   He starts off with this tremendous burst of praise and of acclamation.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.080]   Now, here is something, I think, which must cause us to pause at once.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.040]   The apostle, I say, starts here with a great word of praise.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.840]   "Blessed be God! Praised be God!"
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.040]   He always starts like that.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.920]   Go through all his epistles and you'll find that he does it invariably.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.320]   That's his opening note, that's the first thing always.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.360]   Praise and thanksgiving.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.960]   The apostle praises God because he did understand the doctrine.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.440]   It was as the result of his contemplation of it that he does praise,
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.280]   so that when he begins to write,
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.600]   it's in the background of all this that he's been contemplating and realizing.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.360]   So he starts with his praise.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.800]   And surely praise and thanksgiving
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.040]   are another of the most striking characteristics of the Christian life.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.520]   Take, for instance, the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.080]   It has been said of that book that it's the most lyrical book in the world,
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.680]   and I believe that's perfectly true.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.000]   In spite of all the persecution those people had to endure,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.200]   and in spite of all the hardships and all the difficulties,
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   there is a spirit there in that book that is quite irrepressible.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.760]   Those people were being thrilled with a joy and a peace and a happiness,
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.080]   not only that they'd never known before,
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.600]   but which the world had never known before and had never seen before.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.840]   That's the great characteristic of the Christian.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.440]   Praise and thanksgiving.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.320]   You can't read your New Testament epistles without finding the same thing.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.240]   This is the great appeal always, isn't it?
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.840]   Rejoice in the Lord.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.800]   And again I say rejoice, rejoice evermore.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.080]   And even in a book like the book of Revelation,
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   which pictures the trials and the tribulations and the troubles
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.280]   that were coming and would come upon God's people,
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.200]   oh, running through it all is this note of triumph and of praise
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.520]   and of worship and of glorification.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.160]   Take chapters four and five, and there you see it.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.760]   It is the ultimate characteristic of God's people, of Christians.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.400]   And of course that is quite inevitable in view of what we've already seen
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.600]   in this particular epistle.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.520]   If we did realize together last Sunday morning
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.240]   what grace means and what peace it leads to,
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.760]   well, we can't help praising.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.880]   And therefore I suggest, before we go any further,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.720]   that there is no more thorough test of our Christian profession this morning
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.120]   than just this.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.120]   How prominent is the element of praise and of thanksgiving in our life?
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.520]   Is it something that is to be found welling up out of our hearts
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.440]   and out of our experiences, as it invariably did with this great apostle?
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.720]   Is it something that's constantly breaking out and bursting forth?
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.880]   Is it manifest in our lives?
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.480]   Now let's be clear about this.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.520]   I'm not speaking simply of using certain words.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.120]   I know that there is a type of Christian who,
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.440]   having heard the kind of teaching that I'm giving now,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.400]   decides from there on, every time he or she speaks,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.160]   to use the phrase, "Praise the Lord,"
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.640]   in order that he or she may give the impression
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.360]   of being a Christian who's full of praise and of thanksgiving.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.680]   They just use phrases and use them glibly.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.720]   I'm not speaking of that.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.960]   Because there's nothing glib about this.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.200]   There's nothing merely formal and superficial.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.680]   This comes out of the depths of the man's heart, his being.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.720]   It's heartfelt.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:22.000]   His whole life is one of praise, and he doesn't know how to contain himself.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.760]   That's the kind of thing to which I'm referring.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:31.440]   And surely we must agree, it's impossible to go through the New Testament
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.360]   without seeing that this is the supreme thing.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.480]   It stands to reason, doesn't it?
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.160]   If this gospel is true, that God has sent his own Son into the world
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.120]   to do things for people who are called Christians,
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.600]   well then, you'd expect them to be entirely different.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.520]   You'd expect them to be in such a relationship with God
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.040]   that it would be evident to all,
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.760]   and surely it should lead to this above everything else,
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.080]   this quality of joy.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.840]   Now, let me say this for the Roman Catholics
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.560]   whose doctrine and teaching I so often criticise.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.680]   They canonise certain people as saints.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.720]   We don't agree with that,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.880]   but we do agree with one of the qualifications
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.600]   which they put down as being absolutely essential
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.760]   before they will canonise a person.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.720]   And what is it?
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.480]   Well, it's just this thing I'm talking about.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.920]   It's this quality of joy.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.720]   It isn't enough, according to them,
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.120]   that this person should have worked miracles, even,
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.160]   unless there is evident in that person's life
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.120]   this quality of joy and of praise.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.800]   They won't canonise such a person.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.680]   I think at that point they're absolutely right.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.840]   And that is why you have these constant exhortations
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.600]   to the Christians in the New Testament
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.080]   to praise God and to rejoice in him
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.760]   and to offer up their thanksgiving.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.920]   It is the thing that differentiates us from the world.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.640]   The world rarely is very miserable and very unhappy.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.160]   It's full of cursings and grumbles and complaints.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.000]   Listen to people talking to one another.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.200]   That's it always, isn't it?
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.120]   Well, this is the thing that marks off the Christian.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.440]   And of course, it is true of the Christian,
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.800]   particularly in his prayer and in his worship.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.560]   You read the manuals on the devout life
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.920]   and on the devotional life,
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.160]   which have been written throughout the centuries,
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.880]   and again, irrespective of all communions.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.320]   And I think you will find that they all agree
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.960]   that the highest point of all worship
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.080]   and of all prayer is adoration,
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.920]   praise and thanksgiving.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.160]   True prayer doesn't consist merely of petitions
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.760]   and of desires expressed.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.360]   The ultimate, the acme of prayer and of worship
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.240]   is adoration, thanksgiving and worship.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.760]   My dear friends, must we not all plead guilty at this point?
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.080]   Aren't we all aware of a terrible deficiency
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.720]   and a terrible lack, as we put it like this?
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.120]   When we pray in private or together in public,
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.680]   what part has adoration in it?
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.800]   Do we like just to be in the presence of God,
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.080]   as one of the writers of the hymns puts it,
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.640]   to gaze and gaze on thee?
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.360]   In worship and in adoration, sometimes silent,
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.400]   sometimes vocal.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.920]   Blessed be the God and Father ascribing unto God
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.120]   all this praise, this blessedness, this glory.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.480]   It's the highest point.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.960]   And I say the measure of our growth in grace,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.040]   the measure of our ultimate true Christianity
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:51.920]   is the place that this ascription of praise unto God
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.200]   and of adoration has in our life.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.120]   Oh, it's when you and I become lost in wonder,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.680]   love and praise, that we're really functioning
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.680]   as God means us to function in Christ.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.160]   And so I say again that we must examine ourselves.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.120]   It's a terrible thing to reflect, isn't it?
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.440]   And to realize that that is really the object
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.440]   of a public act of worship such as this.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.400]   And let us, who are so-called non-conformists,
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.240]   examine ourselves at this point.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.760]   Of course, we're not going to be misled by windows
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.000]   or by types of building or by mere beautiful phrases
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.760]   in litanies and things like that.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.040]   But let us remember this.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.920]   The primary object of every service
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.000]   is to adore and to worship God.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.960]   And worship means real worship of the heart.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.560]   It doesn't mean repeating phrases.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.680]   I say again, it means that the heart goes out
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.080]   in this great praise unto God.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.720]   We don't come to God's house simply to seek things,
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.160]   to seek even blessings and seek and desire various things.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.080]   We don't come to listen to sermons.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.880]   We shouldn't.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.520]   We should come to worship and to adore God.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.840]   Blessed be the God and Father.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.440]   It's the starting point.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.640]   It's the highest point.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.520]   Yes, but let us notice even this.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.160]   That the praise and the adoration and the worship
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:32.960]   are to be ascribed to the holy, blessed Trinity.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.760]   Did you notice that?
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.360]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.480]   who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.800]   I read here, it means blessings in the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.280]   So that not only must we praise and worship and adore,
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.760]   this worship must be offered to
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.000]   and the praise must be ascribed to
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.400]   the three blessed persons.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.520]   Now, the Apostle Paul always does that again.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.880]   He never fails to do it.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.360]   And he delights in doing it.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.960]   He delights in mentioning the Father and the Son
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.080]   and the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:21.280]   And once more, may we pause for a moment to ask a question.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.400]   Is this true of our worship?
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.800]   Do we realize that this is again a test
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.320]   of our Christian profession?
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.760]   Let me put it in the form of a positive statement.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.960]   The Christian position is always Trinitarian.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.840]   And it must be.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.920]   And Christian worship must be Trinitarian
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.360]   if it is to be true worship.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.160]   There's no question of choice about this.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.320]   It is, I say, quite inevitable.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.240]   If we have got the correct biblical New Testament view
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.960]   of salvation, well then the three persons
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.920]   of the blessed Holy Trinity must always
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.600]   and invariably be present.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.480]   Now, this is a tremendous thought.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.000]   It's a staggering thought, isn't it?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.040]   So often people stop at just one person.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.440]   Some stop at the person of the Father only.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.960]   They talk about God and about worshiping God
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.360]   and about having forgiveness from God.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.960]   And in all that talk and conversation,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.120]   even the Lord Jesus Christ isn't mentioned.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.960]   And then there are others who seem to stop almost only
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.280]   and entirely with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:44.000]   And they're so concentrated upon him
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.160]   that you hear little of the Father
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   and little of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.040]   And there are others whose entire conversation
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.680]   seems to be about the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.240]   and they're interested in spiritual manifestations.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.120]   I think you know what I mean.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.840]   There is this constant danger of forgetting
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.480]   that as Christians we of necessity worship
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.320]   the three persons in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.080]   Christianity is Trinitarian.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.360]   It starts there, it continues there,
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.120]   as I'm now going to try to show you.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.920]   But not only, I say, must we be careful always
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.880]   that the three persons are in our minds
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.920]   and in our worship,
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.400]   we must be equally careful that they come in the order
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.240]   in which they always do in the scriptures.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.920]   The Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.560]   there is this kind of divine subordination.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.040]   It is a subordination determined
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.040]   by the blessed persons themselves,
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.480]   but they have done so.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.000]   And so we have this order.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:51.680]   And you and I must always preserve this order.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.840]   Ultimately we take our worship to the Father,
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.520]   through the Son, by the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.480]   And there is a danger, I say,
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.880]   on the part of evangelical Christians in particular
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   to offer all their prayers to the Son.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.440]   There are others, I say, who forget the Son altogether,
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.160]   but the two wrongs don't make one right.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.920]   We worship the Father.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.040]   We go to him through the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.400]   but our end, our goal, is God himself.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.240]   Well, very well, I say, let us notice here
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.360]   that at the very commencement,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.440]   the apostle not only praises,
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.960]   but he praises the three blessed persons
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.080]   and ascribes unto them this thanksgiving
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:40.720]   and this glory and in the invariable order.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.840]   Well, now that's the first thing,
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.680]   but let me hurry on to a second thing.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:51.200]   And the second thing is why God is to be praised.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   My first principle was that a true realization
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.160]   of the nature of salvation leads to praise.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.000]   But why should it lead to praise?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.200]   Why should the blessed persons in the Holy Trinity
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.640]   be thus praised?
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.240]   Well, now, there are many answers, of course,
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:06.960]   to that question.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.160]   Let me concentrate on the one
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.880]   that the apostle emphasizes supremely in this verse.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.840]   God, of course, is to be praised
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.840]   because he is who and what he is.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.280]   He is blessed.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.000]   The ultimate character of God is blessedness.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.840]   It's indescribable, of course.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.800]   You can't define it.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.640]   You can't put it into words.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.400]   But if there is one quality,
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.120]   one attribute of God that makes God God,
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.160]   I speak with reverence and stand on holy ground.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.640]   If there's one thing that makes God God
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.680]   more than anything else, it is blessedness.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.280]   And God is to be praised,
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.520]   and we are to say, "Blessed be God,"
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.200]   because God is who and what he is.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:54.400]   God is also to be praised because he has blessed us.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.280]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.560]   "who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.720]   "in heavenly places in Christ."
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.760]   I don't even stay with that this morning.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.200]   Because you notice that before we come to that,
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.520]   the apostle has come to something else.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.840]   And this is the thing that I must emphasize today.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:19.040]   God is to be praised and to be blessed
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.320]   because of the way in which he has blessed us.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.360]   He has blessed us, yes,
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.880]   but what the apostle emphasizes
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.800]   at the beginning of this verse is
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.720]   the way in which he has blessed us.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.040]   And I've already been hinting at that
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.440]   in reminding you of the importance
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.560]   of realizing our relationship to the three persons
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.720]   of the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.680]   In other words, the great message of this verse,
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.120]   as I understand it, is
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.800]   the planning of our salvation.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.360]   Not only the plan,
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.280]   but the way in which it's been planned.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.480]   The way in which God has brought it,
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.680]   a person brought it about.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.160]   Oh, yes, we've been blessed.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.520]   Yes, but the question is,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.880]   how have we been blessed?
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.520]   That's the thing.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.960]   Now, here again, I think we must plead guilty.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.480]   Isn't this something, once more,
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.960]   that we've been intending to neglect and to ignore?
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.880]   How often, I wonder, have we sat down
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.240]   and have tried to contemplate,
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.400]   as the result of reading the scripture,
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.840]   the planning of salvation,
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.560]   the way in which God worked out his plan,
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.240]   planned it, and put it into operation.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:36.160]   It's a very good test, again, of our understanding.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.840]   Oh, I can't say too often I plead so guilty to it myself.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.200]   The trouble with us all
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.960]   is our morbid preoccupation with ourselves
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.520]   and our states and moods and needs.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.400]   All along, we talk in terms of ourselves
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.600]   and what's happening to us.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   Of course, that's of vital importance.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.840]   Christianity is experimental.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.760]   There is no such thing as a Christianity
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.440]   which is not experimental.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.160]   But my dear friends, it isn't only experimental.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.720]   And indeed, as I want to try to show this morning,
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.120]   it is the measure to which we understand
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.400]   that we shall experience.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.800]   But we spend all our time
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.560]   in feeling our spiritual pulses,
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.400]   taking our spiritual temperature,
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.720]   talking about ourselves and moods and conditions,
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.800]   our whole conversation's about that.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.960]   And how little do we talk about the plan
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.800]   and the planning and what God has done.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.320]   And yet, I say, this is the thing
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.840]   with which the apostle starts
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.640]   and with which he always starts.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.200]   The Bible itself starts with it.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.320]   And I'm calling attention to it
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.160]   not because I'm animated
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.560]   by some academic or theoretical interest.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.640]   I'm calling attention to it
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.840]   because, as I say,
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.680]   we rob ourselves of so much of the glories
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.520]   and the riches of grace
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.080]   because we won't take the trouble to understand it.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.400]   We don't face the teaching of Scripture.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   You see, we tend to take a chapter like this
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.320]   in one sermon or one address.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.560]   We slur all these great phrases,
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.160]   we intone them and we pass on.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.400]   We don't stop and analyze them
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.680]   and break them up and realize
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.040]   what they're saying to us.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.080]   And of course, we even try to excuse
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.040]   what we do by saying,
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.280]   "But that's theology, that's doctrine."
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.440]   And we say, "We're not interested in that.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.360]   "We want to be practical Christians
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.360]   "and we want to enjoy Christianity."
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.080]   And so we even try to justify ourselves
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.640]   for our failure to understand
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.800]   the planning of salvation.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.080]   But how terribly wrong we are at that point.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.880]   Scripture gives this teaching to all of us.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.080]   The Apostle Paul writes this letter
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.800]   that these people might understand these things,
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.960]   not simply experience something,
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.040]   but look at it from God's end,
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.120]   from God's eternal purpose.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.320]   These people, who are many of them slaves,
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.440]   hadn't had a secondary or even a primary education,
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.880]   they are meant to grapple
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.280]   with the theology of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.560]   We say, "We haven't got the time.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.920]   "We can't be bothered."
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.520]   Shame on us Christian people.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.840]   And if you're suffering this morning
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.520]   from what Charles Lamb called
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.080]   "the mumps and measles of the soul,"
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.520]   believe me, it's due to the fact
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.800]   that you've never taken the trouble
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.480]   to understand Christian doctrine.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.800]   I'm so concerned about this
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   that perhaps you'll forgive me an illustration.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.560]   We spent about 26 Sunday mornings
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.320]   from January to the middle of July this year,
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.760]   those who attend here regularly,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.360]   in considering what I call spiritual depression,
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.440]   the causes of our unhappiness,
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.720]   the causes of our failure.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:57.280]   And, if I may so put it,
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.800]   I think we enjoyed ourselves.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.600]   (audience laughs)
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.200]   And we enjoyed ourselves
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.760]   partly because we like talking about our complaints.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.240]   It seemed so personal, so direct, didn't it?
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.120]   And we considered the causes
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.880]   and the treatment and the application.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.160]   It was tremendously interesting.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.680]   It was so personal.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.520]   Yes, but you know, my friends,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.200]   during all those weeks, we were in a hospital.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.040]   It was just hospital treatment.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.640]   We were looking at the temperature chart,
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.960]   at the pulse rate, the rate of breathing,
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.520]   and we were analyzing symptoms
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.520]   and giving the appropriate medication.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.080]   It was very interesting, very enjoyable.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.680]   Yes, but it was being in hospital.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.720]   Where are we now?
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.480]   Well, we've come out of the hospital.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.720]   Where are we now?
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.160]   Well, we've gone away.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.840]   We're on some great mountaintop.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.160]   We're breathing pure air.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.840]   Our lungs are meant to expand.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.920]   It's not even a convalescent home.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.520]   We've got beyond that.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.800]   We're breathing God's glorious air
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.720]   and the oxygen is entering in.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.080]   We want to be strong.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.840]   We don't want to go back to hospitals again.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.120]   This is positive, that was negative.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:21.600]   But I say all this because I'm asking this question.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.240]   Do you find this equally enjoyable?
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.360]   This demands effort, doesn't it?
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.280]   You're not lying in a bed.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   You're walking about on top of the mountain.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.960]   You're trying to exercise your limbs
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.240]   to develop your muscles,
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.760]   to fold back your shoulders.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.440]   It's demanding.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.160]   Oh, but what glorious results come from it.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.640]   Here we are, I say,
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.960]   on one of the mountain peaks of God,
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.200]   looking up into the heavens,
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.520]   seeing the great mountain ranges
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.160]   stretching ever onwards and onwards.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.780]   That's it.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.560]   And God means us all to dwell in a place like this.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.400]   And I say it is essential that we should do so
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.280]   because if we don't,
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.840]   we won't be able to worship God properly.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.360]   If there's no praise in your life,
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.280]   it's because you're still in hospital.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.480]   If you want to praise God,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.080]   well, come and look at the truth
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.520]   and try to understand it,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.880]   look in your eyes to it.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.520]   Expand your soul
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.280]   as you come face to face with it.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.120]   This is the way to praise God.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.920]   If you want to say blessed be God from your heart,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.680]   you must know something about him
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.040]   and know what he's done
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.520]   and how he's planned this great salvation.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.800]   Well, that brings me to it.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.120]   What is this plan?
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.600]   Well, it's all suggested in this verse.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.920]   There was, you see,
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.000]   a great eternal council held
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.400]   between the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.440]   When was it held?
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.120]   The next verse tells you.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.040]   According as he hath chosen us in him
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.120]   before the foundation of the world,
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:56.480]   you are interested in salvation.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.680]   Yes, but did you realize
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.200]   that your salvation was planned
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.280]   before the world was ever made and created?
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.080]   That's the sort of thing
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.000]   that makes a man stand on tiptoes
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.520]   and shout out, "Praise God!"
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.960]   Planned before the foundation of the world.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:18.320]   The three blessed persons in the Trinity
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.440]   were concerned about it.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.960]   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.680]   You read in the book of Genesis,
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.160]   God said, "Let us make men."
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.000]   Why the plural?
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.600]   Well, the council, you see,
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.800]   the conference,
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.960]   the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit,
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.920]   "Let us make men in our own image."
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:43.040]   But thank God that council
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.200]   not only considered the creation of men,
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.640]   it went on to consider also
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.840]   the salvation of men.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.360]   The three persons spoke
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.960]   and met together in conference.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.520]   I speak with reverence in terms of Scripture,
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.560]   and they planned it.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.320]   Oh, let us get rid of this notion
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.080]   that salvation was an afterthought.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.280]   The salvation of men
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.680]   is not an afterthought in the mind of God.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.600]   It wasn't even a thought that came to God
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.680]   after men had fallen and had sinned
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.200]   before the fall,
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.360]   before the very foundation of the world.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.120]   It was all planned out.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.080]   That's what he tells us.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   And the work was divided up
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.920]   amongst the three blessed persons.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.080]   I'm simply hinting at these things this morning
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.440]   for you to see it as a whole.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.760]   We'll come to deal with it in detail later.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.320]   The three persons took up their various positions
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.600]   and their various tasks.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:39.120]   That is why the old theologians
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.280]   used to talk about an economic trinity,
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.400]   that the three blessed persons in the Trinity
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.920]   are divided up the work,
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   the economics of it, if you like,
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.120]   the Father planned,
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.120]   the Son puts it into operation,
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.640]   and the Holy Spirit applies it.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.200]   Now let me show you all that in this very chapter.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.360]   Go home and study it and you'll find this.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.000]   In verses 4 to 6 of this first chapter of Ephesians,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   you are told about the Father's part.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.360]   In verses 7 to 12,
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.680]   you are told about the Son's part.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.600]   In verses 13 and 14,
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.680]   you are told about the Holy Spirit's part.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.600]   He tells you it in embryo in the third verse,
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.120]   Father, Son, and Spirit,
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.560]   but then it's divided up.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.040]   And you'll notice that in each case,
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.640]   the work is ended with this phrase,
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.760]   "to the praise of the glory of his grace."
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.360]   There it is in verse 6.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.800]   In verse 12, that we should be
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.320]   "to the praise of his glory," and so on.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.760]   Verse 14, "and to the praise of his glory."
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.840]   So you see, the Council considered all this
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.520]   before the foundation of the world,
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.840]   and the work was divided up and planned in that manner.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.880]   The Father thinks it out, has his purpose.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.680]   The Son volunteers and says he's going to do it.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.960]   He came and did it.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.280]   And the Holy Spirit says, "I will apply it."
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.200]   And he's there the whole time,
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.680]   keeping it going and furthering its purpose.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.880]   Yes, but before we leave it,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.080]   I must add just this.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.960]   That what really happened in that Eternal Council
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.400]   was that a great covenant,
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.520]   a great covenant was drawn up,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.640]   called, if you like, the covenant of grace
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.000]   or the covenant of redemption.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.080]   But dear me, says someone,
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.760]   "Where is that in the third verse
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.320]   of the first chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians?"
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.760]   Let me ask you a question, by way of reply.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.880]   Why does the Apostle say, do you think,
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.040]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.640]   Why did he say that?
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.040]   Is it just a phrase again?
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.680]   Is it just one of those resounding things
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.600]   that he's rather delighted in doing?
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.720]   Believe me, it wasn't.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.000]   He says this with very great deliberation
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.240]   in order to introduce us to this truth.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.840]   He doesn't say, "Blessed be God."
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.680]   Not even, "Blessed be God the Father."
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:03.520]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.960]   Why does he put it like that?
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.680]   Let me answer.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.880]   There are those who say the answer
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.080]   is that he wants us to know the kind of Father God is.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.960]   I agree with it.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.240]   I remember an old preacher once saying,
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.120]   he said, "You know, if you go and tell some people
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.200]   that God is Father, they'd be terrified and alarmed."
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   There are some people to whom the term Father
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.920]   conjures up nothing but a beast, a drunkard,
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.440]   who spent all the family's money
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.120]   and starved his wife and children
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.080]   and came home drunk and smashed the furniture.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.760]   That's their idea of Father.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.440]   It's the only Father they've ever known.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.920]   And said the old preacher, "God, in his kindness,
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.960]   in order that we might know the kind of Father he is,"
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.280]   said, "I am not only Father,
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.520]   I am the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.600]   The Son is like the Father.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.200]   If you know him, you know me.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.640]   That's the sort of fatherhood.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.320]   Quite right, I'll accept it all.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.840]   But you know, it doesn't go far enough."
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.760]   There's much more than that here.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.960]   This is one of the most important statements
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.160]   in the New Testament.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.920]   It's a new description of God.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.320]   Go back to your Old Testament.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.680]   How do you find God described?
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.720]   Isn't it like this?
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.600]   The God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Jacob.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.800]   "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Jacob,"
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   said God when he addressed certain people.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.560]   Or he speaks of himself as the God of Israel.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.880]   But it isn't that now.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.960]   It isn't the God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Jacob.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.440]   It's the God and Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.320]   Why the change?
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.960]   Well, it's just to teach us this.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.440]   That all the blessings that come to us,
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:56.960]   come to us in and through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.680]   And because of that covenant that was made between them,
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.320]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:10.960]   But you say blessings came to the Old Testament saints.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.520]   Of course.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.200]   But the teaching of the scripture is that
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.520]   those blessings came to the Old Testament saints
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.120]   through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.640]   You see, what happened was this.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.640]   There, before the foundation of the world,
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.920]   God saw what was happening, what would happen to men.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.880]   He saw the fall.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.840]   He saw everything.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.760]   And this question of men's sin and fall had to be dealt with.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.680]   And there the plan was drawn up.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.800]   And an agreement was made between the Father and the Son.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.600]   And it was this.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:46.960]   The Son volunteered to make himself responsible for fallen men.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:52.320]   He contracted to do certain things.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.400]   And God the Father on his side contracted to do other things.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.800]   God the Father said that he would grant forgiveness
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.240]   and reconciliation and restoration and new life
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:09.040]   and a new nature to all who were covered by his Son
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.080]   on condition that the Son should come into the world
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.320]   and take human nature upon himself
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.880]   and take the sin of mankind upon himself
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.600]   and bear its punishment, stand for them,
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.720]   and suffer for them, and represent them.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.080]   That was the covenant.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.840]   That was the agreement that was made.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.240]   And it was made before the foundation of the world.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.800]   God was able to tell Adam about that in the Garden of Eden,
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.960]   you remember, when he told him that the seed of the woman
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.120]   should bruise the serpent's head.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:41.760]   There it is.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.640]   It had already been made and God begins to announce it.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.240]   But then, you see, there were many subsidiary arrangements made.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.840]   A covenant was made with Noah.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.680]   A covenant was made with Abraham.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.520]   A covenant was made with Moses.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.200]   They're not the ultimate covenant.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.440]   This is the covenant, the covenant made with the Son.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.320]   The others were temporary, they were local.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.640]   They were to meet certain eventualities.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.960]   But all the subsidiary covenants point forward to this great covenant.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.840]   The law of Moses is full of grace.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.480]   All the types in the ceremonial of your temple,
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.080]   they're all pointing to Christ.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.520]   That's the ultimate covenant.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.560]   This is a temporary covenant until that comes.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:23.600]   The law is our schoolmaster to lead us to Christ, says Paul to the Galatians.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.320]   And you see his great argument.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.400]   He says the law given to Moses doesn't disannul the covenant made with Abraham.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.000]   That's the fundamental thing.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.920]   And that is simply a statement of the still more fundamental one
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.160]   made with the Son himself in eternity.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:51.360]   Now then we begin to see why he says the God and Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:42:01.360]   He's praising the God who before time and before the world saw our predicament
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:08.960]   and entered into this tremendous unthinkable agreement with his own Son.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.240]   He's made an oath.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.160]   He's signed the covenant.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.680]   He's pledged himself.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.120]   He's committed himself.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.160]   The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.680]   Everything is in Christ.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.280]   He's our representative.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.720]   He's our mediator.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.320]   He's our guarantor.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.240]   And it all comes in and through him.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:33.040]   Words fail us, don't they?
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.920]   Can you realize what all this meant to the Father?
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.760]   Can you realize what all this meant to the Son?
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:46.400]   Can you realize what all this meant to the Holy Spirit?
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.720]   But that is our gospel, my friends.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:56.000]   And I'm suggesting that it's only as we understand these things
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.400]   that we shall begin to praise God.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.560]   Look at it like this.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:08.080]   Here are you and I, miserable worms in this world.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.360]   Yes, that's what we are.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.760]   Miserable worms.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:20.080]   With our arrogance and our pride of men and our pride of life and our appalling ignorance,
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:25.520]   we who defy God, we've all done it.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:31.520]   And we deserve nothing but to be blotted off the face of the earth.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.880]   But you know what happened?
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:46.320]   Before the foundation of the world, this blessed God, these three blessed persons
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.240]   considered you.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.120]   Considered you a condition.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:58.640]   Considered what would happen to you and the consequences of that.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:07.200]   These three ineffable persons, God whom no man hath ever seen nor can see,
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.480]   God who is light and in whom is no darkness at all,
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.480]   this blessed person spoke to consider you and planned all this,
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.760]   that you and I might be forgiven and redeemed.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.560]   The Son said, "I leave this glory.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.640]   I'll be born as a babe.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   I'll dwell in the womb of a woman.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.960]   I'll become a slave.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.720]   I'll suffer insult and ignominy in the world.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.440]   Yes, I'll even let them nail me to a tree and spit in my face."
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.200]   He said, "He'd do all that for you."
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:48.640]   And they planned it and they worked it out and they agreed about it.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:55.840]   And at this very moment, this blessed second person in the Trinity is standing and seated
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.960]   there at the right hand of God, representing you and me.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.840]   And he came down and did all that and rose again.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.600]   And it was all planned there at the beginning for you, for me.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:14.160]   Do you still say you're not interested in covenant theology?
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:20.240]   Do you still say you haven't got the time to be interested in doctrine?
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:27.440]   My dear friend, you'll never begin to praise God or to worship Him or to adore Him
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.880]   until you begin to realize some of this which He's done for you.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.680]   That's what He's done.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:41.680]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.080]   We are in the covenant.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:50.400]   And God willing, next Sunday, we shall go on to try to consider
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.280]   what we are told of some of the consequences of that covenant
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:59.920]   in this self-same third verse of the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:07.760]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
