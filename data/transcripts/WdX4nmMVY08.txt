[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   The jingle is back. It's been recreated, resurrected.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.560]   It resembles the old one, but it's newer, all thanks to our audio and video team.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.920]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast. Today we close out
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.880]   the week with a question from a longtime listener named Chris. Chris writes in
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.600]   Simply to Ask This. "Pastor John, is Jesus a Christian
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.120]   hedonist, and if so, what would be your primary proofs
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.520]   from Scripture?" Well, he asks quite simply, and I answer
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.960]   quite simply, yes, without the slightest hesitation.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.840]   Jesus lived to glorify his Father
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:50.000]   by enjoying him as the sustaining power in all his suffering, and by
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.520]   seeking to enjoy him forever on the other side of the greatest suffering,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.440]   and by means of the greatest suffering. So that's what I mean
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.920]   by being a Christian hedonist, and to boot, he taught us to be motivated in the
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.560]   same way. So here are some of the texts
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.680]   to consider. In his final great high priestly prayer, John 17, he says,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.680]   "Father, I glorified you on the earth, having accomplished the work you gave me
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.280]   to do. Now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.400]   that I had with you before the world existed."
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.600]   So he was pursuing this restoration of the fullness of glory
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.680]   and joy in his Father's presence, and then he prays for us that we will
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.480]   become part of it. In verse 24, "Father, I desire
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.160]   that they also whom you have given me may be with me where I am to see
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.240]   my glory that you have given me before, because you love me before the
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.560]   foundation of the world." That's what Jesus was
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.400]   referring to, I think, when he said that one day we would
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:16.080]   enter into the joy of our Master. His consummated joy with the Father
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.880]   would one day be ours. That's what he was pursuing, and that's
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.440]   what he wants us to pursue. And we see this confirmed
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.920]   explicitly in Hebrews 12.2. We are to,
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.960]   it says, "Look to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.080]   for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.400]   is seated at the right hand of the throne of God." That was the power that
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.920]   brought Jesus through his suffering, the joy
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.520]   that was set before him. It's not a defective motive to be sustained
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.280]   by the hope of joy on the other side of, and as a result of, your obedience in
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.720]   suffering. That's not a defective motive. To call it defective, like so many
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.280]   philosophers have, is to indict the Lord Jesus with
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.280]   defect. And then he told us to make
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.240]   this joy in God our top priority. That's what the command to love God
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.560]   with all the heart means. We don't enrich God with our heart
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.280]   when we love God with all our heart. Our hearts are enriched by him. That's
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.120]   what loving God with all the heart means. He becomes our supreme treasure. So when
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.080]   Jesus says, "You shall love the Lord your God
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.000]   with all your heart," he means find God to be your heart's
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.680]   total satisfaction. What else could he mean?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.760]   Find his beauty and his glory and justice, his goodness,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.920]   his truth, everything there is about him. Find that to be
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.200]   your heart's treasure. That's what love God with all the heart
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.000]   means. And then he underlines this when he says in Luke 10 20,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.760]   "Do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you."
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.680]   So the disciples had just come back, and God had used them to cast out
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.560]   demons and set people free, and they were thrilled at the power God had given them.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.320]   And Jesus says, "Don't rejoice in this, that
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.360]   spirits are subject to you. Rejoice that your names are written in
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.280]   heaven." In other words, beware of even having ministry triumphs
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.400]   as a competing joy in your heart alongside your joy of being there
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.040]   with God in heaven. Make God your supreme
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   joy even higher than the joy of ministry joys,
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.320]   indeed the basis of all ministry joys. And then to underline this, he warned
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:20.320]   us against a kind of self-pity when we make sacrifices for him.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.200]   I just remember when I first saw this years ago, where he had just got done
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.720]   sending the rich young ruler away and saying how hard it is
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.240]   to enter the kingdom of heaven. And Peter pipes up
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.600]   and says, "See, we have left everything and followed you."
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.000]   In other words, we've kind of made some sacrifices here, Jesus, so
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.480]   we're not in that category. And Jesus' response to him is amazing,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.080]   and I wish I could hear his tone of voice, you know, like, "Come on, Peter."
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.520]   I'm not sure what his tone of voice was, but here's what he said.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.160]   Jesus said, "Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.480]   brothers or sister or mother or father or children
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.880]   or lands for my sake and the gospel's who will not receive back
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.560]   a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.400]   children and lands, yes, with persecutions and in the age to
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.240]   come, eternal life." Now, what's the point of that? The point
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.560]   is, Peter, come on, Peter, do you think, do you really think
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.760]   that in making the sacrifices you have made, you struck some kind of bad deal
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.720]   that should cause you to have any element of self-pity at all? You've
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.680]   exchanged one house for hundreds, you've exchanged one life for eternal
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.880]   ages of life. Now, that's pure Christian hedonism in telling Peter,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.280]   "Stop feeling sorry for yourself in following me in spite of all the
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.720]   suffering that it's going to cost you." And then finally, I would say,
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.280]   Jesus motivates us over and over
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.520]   by appealing to the joy that comes to those who treasure Jesus enough to
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.840]   suffer loss in this world for the greater joy that is
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.400]   is set before him. Just listen to these and see whether or not this is not
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.800]   pure Christian hedonistic motivation when Jesus talks like this.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:35.200]   Luke 6:35, "Love your enemies and do good and lend,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.840]   expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great." In other
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.120]   words, in this life, don't expect anything back. You're just
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.920]   going to have trouble in this life, but oh, will your reward be great. So press on
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.880]   in loving your enemies because your joy is going to be
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.280]   full along this path and at the end of this path especially.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.360]   Or Luke 14, 13, "When you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.040]   the blind, and you will be blessed because they
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:14.880]   cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just."
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.000]   So how's he motivating us to love the poor?
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.040]   He's motivating us to love the poor because
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.120]   our joy at the end of the line, no matter what it's cost us in this life, is going
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.360]   to be overflowing. And if we love the poor, well, maybe we'll
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.040]   be able to take some of them with us as we go, which is why this is
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:39.120]   not mercenary to be motivated this way. And then he says in Matthew 6, 19,
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.960]   "Don't lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.720]   where thieves break in and steal." In other words, that's a stupid way to
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.840]   invest in your life. "Rather," verse 20, "lay up for yourselves
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.680]   treasures in heaven." Be rich in heaven. Try to be rich
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.320]   there, "where neither moth nor rust destroys nor thieves break in
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.160]   and steal." How do you do that? How do you lay up for yourselves treasures in
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.040]   heaven? Luke 12, 33, "Sell your possessions,
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.680]   give to the needy, and thus provide yourselves with money
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.040]   bags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.760]   not fail, where no thief approaches, no moth destroys."
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:27.040]   So, clearly, we're to make big sacrifices in this world, which proved to be no
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.080]   sacrifice at all, because it's investment in our
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.320]   treasures going bigger and bigger and bigger
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.560]   in the age to come. And then the most familiar statement of all, perhaps,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.000]   from Acts 20, 35, one of the few quotes from Jesus
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.360]   outside the Gospels, "It is more blessed, more satisfying, more happy,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.960]   more contentment producing when you lay your head down on the pillow at night." It
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.320]   is more blessed to give than to receive. So that's pure
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.720]   Christian hedonism. So my answer is yes, Jesus was a Christian hedonist. He is
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.160]   today a Christian hedonist, I would argue. That could be another
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.240]   another APJ. The best one ever, Jesus was the best
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.480]   Christian hedonist who ever existed, both in his own motivation
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:24.880]   and in his teaching about motivation. He lived for the glory of his Father
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.160]   by being satisfied in his Father in living
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.880]   and dying. He was sustained by the joy in this life that he had with his
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.440]   Father, would have with his Father in full, and he sought the fullness of
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.400]   pain-free joy on the other side of the cross, and that's what got him
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.480]   through. And in all of this, he taught us, he taught us how to live and how to
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.320]   suffer for the joy that is set before us in
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.840]   God. Man, did he ever. Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.160]   and thank you for the question. Chris, please email your questions to us
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.040]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. Thank you for making the podcast a part
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.080]   of your day. You can find our audio feeds in our
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.320]   episode archive, and you can reach us through email
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.760]   all through our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:22.800]   So what does it mean to pray the Bible? What is that ancient
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.080]   practice? What does it look like, and what does it look like for us today? We
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.520]   have a question queued up on this on Monday, and Pastor John will explain, and
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.840]   not only will he explain, he'll also model this for us on air as well.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.720]   I'm your host Tony Reggie. Have a great weekend. We'll see you back here on
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.280]   Monday.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.240]   you
