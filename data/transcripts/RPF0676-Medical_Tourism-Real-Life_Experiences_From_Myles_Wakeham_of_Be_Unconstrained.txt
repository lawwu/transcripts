[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Miles Wakem, welcome to the show.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Thank you.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Great to be here.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   So I've had you on.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   We're going to have a chat about finances.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   You blog over at beunconstrained.com,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   talking about your journey to financial independence.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And specifically, I've had you on because you
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   have been doing a recent series, but also having
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   some recent experiences specifically
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   on the topic of medical tourism.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   You've been doing some work in Mexico,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   and I want to hear all about that and talk about it,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   because I think it's a very key financial strategy that more
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and more of us can and should implement.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   But begin with just a little bit of your background.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   How did you wind up in the United States doing
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   the kind of work you're doing, and how did you
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   wind up interested in finance?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It's a very interesting question.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I've always been a-- when I was a kid,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I was always into business.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I always liked businesses.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   When I was eight years old, I ran paper rounds,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   and then I decided to get two of them and three of them
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   and scaled it up and became like the king of paper rounds
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   in my suburb in Australia.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And that led into all different various businesses
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and part-time jobs when I was a teenager
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   all the way through to getting out of school
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   probably way earlier than I should have and going
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   into business on my own.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And I got lucky and got into the computer world in 1978,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   right when the personal computers first started coming out.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Built one of the first software companies in my hometown,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   employed a dozen people and sold it when I was 24, 23, 24.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Got out, came to the United States because I was working--
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   one of my clients was a defense contractor building submarines
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   in Australia, and I met a lot of guys from the States
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   when I was working there.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And one of them said, you sound like a smart guy.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Why don't you come over and work for me?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And I ended up in Los Angeles.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I ended up doing a little bit of work there
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   and then stumbled into a company that got into this thing
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   called Biotechnology, which I had no idea what that was.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And that company became Amgen.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   So I was one of the first, I don't know,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   hundred and something people to stay there.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And I ended up staying there for about five years
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and left with a ton of stock options, which I didn't even know
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   what they were, and retired.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And I was about 32, I think.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I went back to Australia and that didn't end well.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I kind of followed in your-- I'm kind of like the poster child
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   of what happens when you retire too early.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And I know you've spoken about that before.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I can attest to the fact it's 100% correct.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Don't retire too early.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Don't retire.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Actually, I hate that word.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   It's something that doesn't resonate well with me.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   But I did find myself going from zero to hero to zero
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   in that world.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And then I ended up with the dot-com boom sort of happened.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I found myself sort of, I don't know, not getting anything
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   really substantial done in life back in my hometown.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So I decided to get back on a plane and came back to California
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   and then eventually moved to Arizona.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And I've been here for-- ever since, what's that, 20 years now.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   How much money did you have when you retired at 32?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Geez, I don't remember now.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It was in the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I bought a house freehold, so I never had any costs.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I had a lot of money.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   We ended up buying some rental properties as well.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And what did you do with yourself?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I got really bored.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I built a recording studio.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I've always been a musical kind of guy.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I always liked recording engineering.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I learned a lot about that when I was living in California.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And I built a studio and I was recording bands, albums,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   because I had nothing better to do.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   The funny thing is I got divorced, probably because I found myself
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   in this what do I do now point of life.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And my wife at the time was looking at me going,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   well, where does life go from here?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And I didn't have an answer because I was-- the journey had come
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   to an end at that point for me and I didn't know what my next chapter
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   was going to be.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And she didn't want to wait around, try and wait for me to find that out.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   So I ended up losing pretty much most of what I had gained.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So you go from financially independent to financially divorced very quickly.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And for anybody out there who's had to go through that,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I don't wish it upon anyone.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But that kind of also led to my-- I don't know,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   it's kind of a weird thing and it's the segue that goes
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   into the whole medical thing.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I found myself alone and in pretty dark time at that point.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And I might not have needed money, but that was the least
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   of my concerns back then.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And some friends of mine said to me one day, do you want to--
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   it was about just after Christmas time.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It was like the day after Christmas.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   They had planned this epic road trip to go up into the Queensland,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   which is like the tropical area of Australia,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   to have New Year's Eve up there.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And they said, look, you don't want to be sitting around here sort
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   of wallowing in your misery.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   You want to come with us.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   So I said, yeah, all right, sounds like a plan.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Jumped in the car and we drove two days to our destination,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   had a week there and we're driving back, got one day through it,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   got in the second day and then really bad things started to happen,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   which is kind of where the whole medical journey begins.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   What happened?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Well, we were driving back across the outback of Australia,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   pretty sort of desolate area.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And I had driven the first few hours of that day.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   It was our second day on our way back home.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And we stopped for lunch.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It was myself, a friend of mine who was in the car and his girlfriend.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And we were driving back.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   We got about halfway through it.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   We had lunch.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   We got back and it was like, okay, he says it's my turn to drive.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So I said, sure, here you go.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Here's the keys.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I get in the back of the car.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I'm in the rear seat.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And off he goes.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   We drove for about 20 minutes.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I'm in there happily reading a book and just, you know,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   there's not much else you can do when you're in the middle of nowhere in the
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   outback of Australia.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   You sit there reading a book, letting him do the driving.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   We went over this crest.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   You know, the road just crested over the top of the hill.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And I didn't think much of it.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Next thing you know, I'm hearing -- I hear water, which is weird.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I mean, I'm in the middle of the outback of Australia.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   It's a splash.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I look up and we're in a lake.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I mean, all I could tell you was this vast water.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   He'd like driven us into a lake.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And it wasn't his fault.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   There was a flash flood.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It washed out the road and no one had put any signs up to tell anybody.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And, you know, I guess maybe it was because we just had lunch and he was
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   traveling probably faster than he should have.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   But he didn't see it.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   We hit the water and like a stone skipping over, you know,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   if you throw a stone across the ocean, it bounces across the top.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   We became that stone.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   We hydroplaned at rapid speed.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And I just remember in the back of my mind -- because everything slows down,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   right?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It goes down to everything seems like a slow motion experience, like a movie.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And I remember saying to myself -- his name's Lindsay.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And I said, "Lindsay, don't lose it, buddy.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Don't lose control of the car."
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And then black, nothing.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And that's all I remember.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   The next thing you know, I wake up and there's this guy cutting the car apart
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   with the jaws of life.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And I'm in the back.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And then on top of me is the car seat from the front passenger seat.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And on top of that was my buddy's girlfriend.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And these guys are cutting me out of the car.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And I'm literally going to say to them, "Hey, forget about me.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Get her.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   She's sitting on top of me.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   You know, get her."
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   But they wouldn't touch her.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And I'm like, "What the heck?"
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Anyway, they pulled me out of the car.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   It was kind of gruesome.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   They got me out, put me on a stretcher.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And it was at that point I looked back and realized she was dead.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And, you know, waking up with a dead body on top of you is kind of not
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   something I'd suggest to anybody, but it happens.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   And anyway, they put you on a stretcher and put you on a medical ambulance
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   and drive you back to the closest country town with a hospital and put us
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   in the emergency room.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And then I remember at that point they must have injected something into me
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   because I was out for I think about six days in a medically induced coma while
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   they tried to put me back together again.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And, yeah, after that I woke up back in my hometown.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   They must have airlifted us to our local hospital.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And I found myself in the bowels of the socialist world of medicine,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   of Australia, and I'm in a room with six other people and I'm getting some
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   level of treatment and I'm on morphine and, you know,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   it was like that for a few days before they started treating me.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So, yeah, what ended up happening was I broke my right femur,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   snapped it in half.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   They pinned that back together before I woke up, which was good.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And then my left shoulder and humerus had been broken in five places and the --
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   so without getting too medical, everyone in their, you know,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   their top arm has a humerus, a big bone with a bowl on the top that slots
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   into your shoulder joint.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   In my case the bowl had completely broken off from the bone,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   completely severed, and then the bone itself had broken in five places.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   So they pinned the bone back together as best they could,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   but they couldn't put the bowl on the top of the bone anymore because they
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   had these pins sticking out of it.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Well, when they do that, the best they could do was to stick it on the side
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   of the bone.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So I ended up walking around with this deformed shoulder and that was kind of,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   you know, I remember the doctor coming into the hospital and saying, well,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I'm sorry, buddy, but this is what you've got for the rest of your life.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   This is what you're going to be dealing with.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And I'm like, you're kidding, aren't you?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Come on, you can do a better job than that.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And he's like, no, that's it.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   That's the best we can do.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   You're going to have arthritis.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   You're going to have limited motion.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   You know, you'd be lucky if you can raise your arm above 90 degrees on a good
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   day.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   But, you know, hey, you didn't die.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   You know, we're all patting ourselves on the back here because you didn't die.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And I'm like, well, thank you for that, but maybe you can fix this thing?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And he's like, no.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   So, you know, no medicine for you.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And that was what I've been living with for the last 22 years.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Wow.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   So what precipitated your deciding to have fresh surgery and then going
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   through the process of trying to figure out where and how to get that surgery?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Why now?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Well, there was a sort of a period post-surgery in Australia when I had this
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   before I decided to come back to the U.S.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I found myself battling against the insurance company, which connects the dots
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   to tell the story.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   So in Australia, when you register a motor vehicle, at least in the state where
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   we lived, it was mandatory as part of your registration that the state government
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   provides a third-party liability policy, and it comes with the insurance.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   So your insurance is much higher than it would be in the United States,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   but you've got this liability policy built into it.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And that policy is supposed to cover anybody who has some sort of medical,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   you know, impact from an accident, of which clearly I was that guy.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I was in the rear seat passenger here.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I had no control of the vehicle.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   I had no control of destiny here.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I wore it.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   So the way the medical system works in Australia is you get put into the
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   government medical system, whether you like it or not, with accident
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   and emergencies.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   And in my case, they put me in, they patched me up, they shipped me out,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   and then all the post-surgery stuff was all supposed to be covered by the
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   insurance that we were given by mandatory, you know, they push it on you,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   you don't get a choice.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   It was supposed to pick up all the post-op, all of the physical therapy,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   everything.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And after a few weeks, they weren't paying.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And I, you know, I'm like, "What gives, guys?"
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And the answer was, "Well, there was an accident that involved a murder."
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   I'm like, "No, it wasn't a murder.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   She was killed.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It was an accident."
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   It's like, "Well, no, we are going to charge the driver with negligent
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   homicide."
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   So the next thing you know, my buddy is being, you know,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   going into state to attend court proceedings because his girlfriend's family
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   were obviously completely distraught with everything that had happened.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   I mean, I get that.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But they were throwing all the blame on him, which I don't know if -- I don't --
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I would not say that was his fault at all.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   I mean, I was in the car, but they wouldn't let me testify in court.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   They just kept wanting to throw it on him.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And because there was this pending murder case, that's how they classed it,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   homicide, they wouldn't pay my medical costs.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   So eventually that case was dismissed as you would expect it to be.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   And then at that point I had already engaged with a lawyer to say, "Hey,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   you guys better pay my medical."
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And, of course, now there was litigation, so they wouldn't pay me either.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And this went on for eight years.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I had no covered medical for eight years while I was waiting for all of these
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   things to blow out.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And meanwhile I got sick and tired of waiting around.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I got remarried.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I had a daughter.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I wanted to give my family a better life.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I couldn't do it in Australia.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It just wasn't economically feasible.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And the dot-com boom was calling.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   So we all got on a plane and came to the United States and landed,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   and it took another three or so years before they eventually paid
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   out on that claim.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Meanwhile I come to the U.S., no health care,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   pre-existing condition.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I got to build everything from nothing.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   I mean I've literally gone from zero to millionaire to zero again,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and now I entered back into the United States for a second time.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   And thankfully within about six years I was a millionaire again.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And that was just because I was a business guy and I just don't take no for an
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   answer.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I just wouldn't put up with being told no, no, no on everything.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   That just permeated into my life in money and finance,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and eventually it permeated into my life in medicine.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   So there are a number of interesting trails we could go down.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   I want to talk about your financial independence journey and a little bit on
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   your expatriation experience because that's part of this.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   But let's start with the move to Mexico to get the surgery that you had
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   recently.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   You came to a point, as I understand the story,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   you came to a point now recently where you said,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   "I want to get this taken care of."
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Were you experiencing further symptoms that were exacerbated recently somehow
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   and that kind of pushed you over the edge or what happened?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Yeah, it did.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   A year ago my wife and I were just bumming around Mexico because in the
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   summer you don't want to stay in Arizona where we live.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   You want to get out.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   So we went down to Mexico City for a week.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   We were in Puerto Vallarta for a week, and we were just doing the tourist thing.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   I'm in Puerto Vallarta going, "You know,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I just don't feel like I'm getting the Mexican experience here."
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   So I said to - I'd watched some YouTube videos of this magical place that
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   everybody was retiring to called Ajijic, and it was on Lake Chapala,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   which is in Jalisco in the center of Mexico.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   It was one of these places where people could go down there and retire on the
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   U.S. Social Security and live a rich life.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I mean, they were - these people were great.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   I said, "I want to go there.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Let's go on a bus for five hours.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   I don't speak any Spanish.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I don't know where I am.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Let's just go."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   She's adventurous, so she said, "Okay, let's do that."
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   So we get on this bus.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   We go to Guadalajara, and then we get an Uber up to Ajijic.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   I got out of the car, and I saw this beautiful little town.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   These people were - everyone was old.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Now, old is the subjective term, but the average age of people in Ajijic is 65.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   What I saw with my own eyes, and I noticed this in the first 15 minutes of being
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   there, was that everybody was skinny, and I say skinny as in svelte.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   They were not overweight.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   There was no obesity at all.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Everybody was happy.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Everybody was healthy.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Everybody was social.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   It was like, "Oh, I want to live here."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   This is utopia, right?
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   I remember we went up to the town square, and there were these people sitting on the -
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   and nobody's afraid to talk to anybody, right?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   So there's this couple of guys sitting on a park bench, and I walked past them,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   and I just sparked up a conversation.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I said to the guy, "You know what?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   You look really happy.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Tell me about what your life's like."
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   This guy, who was about 70, tells me he used to live in Wisconsin,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   and he couldn't afford to retire in America, and he couldn't afford the healthcare,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   and he came here, and his life has been fulfilled, and he's been there for 10 years.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I thought, "Wow, that's a really interesting story."
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   He says, "Yeah, because the medical is so affordable."
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I'm like, "What do you mean?"
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   He goes, "Well, you can get private health coverage in Mexico for less than the cost
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   of your deductible in America."
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   I'm like, "Nah, come on.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   That might be for the citizens here, but it wouldn't be for us, you know, for expats."
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   He goes, "No, no, no.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   You can get it."
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   He says, "Yeah, there's a public system as well, and if you get a permanent residency,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   the easier you get access to that," but he said, "I don't need it.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   I can afford to go to my doctor three times a week because, you know,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I'm paying, I don't know, a couple hundred pesos, which is like 20 bucks,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   and he's getting all the best care proactively, and that's why they're healthy."
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   This resonated with me.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   I heard this message.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   We go back to Arizona, and we're back for about a year, and last March,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I woke up in enormous pain from my shoulder, and I couldn't work out why,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   but it was really, really sore.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I ended up…it dissipated after about three weeks, but it was the sort
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   of pain that was really…and to be honest with you, I got scared because here
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I am going, "Well, you know, this operation was 20 years ago.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Maybe it's got like an expiration date on it.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Maybe I have to get it done again," right?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Maybe the pins are rusting out inside your arm.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Exactly, yeah, exactly, and it's scary because you don't know,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   and I thought, "Oh, I've got a problem here because I don't have health coverage
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   in the U.S.," and Australia says, "Well, once you became a nonresident
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   for tax purposes, you don't get any health care from us either, buddy."
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   So I'm like, "Okay, well, what do I do?"
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And that's when I remembered HAHEEC.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   So I got on the internet, and I went to some of these expat forums
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   of the people who live down there, and I said, "Look, does anybody down there
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   know a good orthopod, a good orthopedic surgeon?"
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   And everybody on the forums, and these people are getting hip replacements
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   and knee replacements and the whole bit, and I told them what I needed,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   and three people gave me the same guy's name, and I thought,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   "That's interesting."
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   So we ended up in June.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   We're back in Mexico, and we went to Guadalajara where this doctor practices,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   and I went and saw him, and he speaks perfect English,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   and we sat down, and the nicest guy, you could never imagine a guy
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   as nice as this, and he said, "Well, first thing we're going to do
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   is send you for some x-rays."
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So okay, so he sends me.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   He's in a very rich medical area, kind of like Beverly Hills almost.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   It's beautiful, tree-lined streets, expensive cars, the whole bit,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   and he says, "Go over there, two doors down.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   There's an x-ray clinic.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Go get me some x-rays."
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   So they took 15 x-rays, and the first thing I noticed was it cost me $15.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   I thought, "What?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Fifteen x-rays for $15.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Okay, that's great."
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   So we go back into his consulting rooms, and he puts them up on the wall,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   and he goes, "Mm-hmm, okay, well," he said, "Look, I can probably fix this.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   I'd have to do a complete shoulder.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   I'm going to have to do a total prosthetic, complete new shoulder for you,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   but what I can do is I can't give you any guarantees, and surgery has risks,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   and all the normal stuff doctors say, but I can guarantee that I can get you
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   better motion than you've got right now.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   You won't be limited in movement like you have been."
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And I said, "Well, okay, how much?"
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And so he gets the calculator out, and he runs all these numbers,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and he gives you some massive number, but it's in pesos.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Well, I said, "Well, you know, what's that in U.S. dollars?"
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   And he goes, "About 9,000 bucks."
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I'm like, "Are you kidding me?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Of course I'm going to take that deal," right?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   And my wife, who's a nurse, is looking at me going, "You better take this deal."
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   So, okay, we go ahead and say, "Sign me up, doc, when you want me,"
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   and then he puts a date on the calendar of somewhere in September and says,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   "Come back and see me then, and we'll get this done."
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   He says, "Since you've decided you want to get it done,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   and since you're here right now, I'm going to send you three doors
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   down the other way to this another imaging place,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   but they're going to do a full MRI on you."
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I'm like, "Okay, I've never actually had an MRI done
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   because no one could afford it."
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   They go down there.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I pay for it, $270 U.S. dollars for an MRI, which is pretty good.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I'm in there for about 20 minutes.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   They took image after image after image.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I go back to the doctor's office.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   He gets the MRI images up because now he's got the detail, and he goes,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   "Oh, we better get this done."
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   I'm like, "What do you mean?"
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   He goes, "You see that?"
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   I said, "Yeah, what's that?"
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   "That's a tumor."
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   "Okay."
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   He goes, "It's benign, so you're okay, but you've got to get this thing done.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   By the way, the reason why you've been in so much pain is there's all these
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   bone spurs on this deformed shoulder you've got that are just cutting
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   into what's left of your muscle.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   If you don't get it done, you won't have any chance of getting
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   this done properly at all."
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   "Okay, doc, sign me up."
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   That's where it all started.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Wow.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Do you have a sense--let's go ahead and just continue it.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Then in September when the date came, you and your wife went back to Mexico.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Tell us about the process and your experience because you don't speak
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Spanish, you're not Mexican, you come from Western, white Australia
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   and the United States, so it's not that you're spending all your time
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   in Latin America.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   What was your experience as a patient crossing that cultural divide
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   and what was your experience?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Well, the one thing that was really interesting was a different motivation
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   that was in the spirit of what was being offered to me.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   You see this really quickly.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   There's a sense of--I guess the Mexicans would call it--the Hispanic
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   or the Latin community would use the phrase "la familia," the family.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   The one thing that's really noticeable to me is that when you go
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   into a doctor's office or you enter a hospital or a nurse comes
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   into your room, you have been welcomed into their family.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   You're like Uncle Miles who's in the family, and they're going
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   to treat you like they were treating their uncle.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   They're going to give you the best focus, the best attention,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   the best care, and they don't leave any stone unturned with this.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   And I've never experienced that before.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Now, in Australia--and a lot of people have very good experiences
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   of health care in Australia, even though it's kind
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   of the socialized medical system and it's free.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Well, it's not free.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   It's taxed, but it's freely available, shall we call it.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   The problem is that it's rationed.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   And what that means is that even when you come out of a motor vehicle,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   horrific motor vehicle accident like I do, you don't get a private room.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   You're put into a ward with six other people.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And, you know, you don't get that premier level of care.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   If I could pay for it, I would have.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   But when you're, you know, lying on a stretch and no one's asking you
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   what sort of insurance you've got, you just get shoved into the system.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   And, you know, don't get me wrong.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I have so many friends who are doctors, and I think doctors have the most--
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   they're the most admirable people.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   They represent, to me, the pinnacle of what we as humans can be in the world.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   I mean, they save other people's lives.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   I mean, you know, I'm a software engineer by trade.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   I don't save people's lives.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   I mean, I'm not important.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   The guy who saves somebody's life, he's important.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   And so I raise them on high.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   I look at them as, you know, important people and valued people.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   And yet everybody I spoke to in Australia who are doctors would complain about the
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   limited resources they were given to be able to do proper patient care.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And then in the U.S., I mean, I even was having a conversation with my
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   physiotherapist this morning about this, and he's telling me, yeah, he says,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   "Yeah, I hate the medical system here.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   I have to do 20 hours a week of coding just to be able to put my stuff through
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   for insurance and for, you know, all these things."
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   He says, "I want to be helping patients.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I didn't go to medical school to become a coder."
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And I get that.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Now, down in Mexico, they don't have to deal with that stuff.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I mean, maybe they do to some degree, but it seems like patient care is the first
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   and foremost focus, and they--
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   if you're willing to go in there with money and you avail yourself to the private
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   system there, you get a hospital environment where there's no stress,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   there's no one running around.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   When I was in hospital after the surgery, I could press a button because maybe my IV
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   was running low, and a nurse was in my room within 30 seconds.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   I mean, I don't get that sort of treatment at the, you know, at the Western.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   I mean, this is crazy good.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Five-star first-class treatment.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   The hospital room, I was in a single room all to myself.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   It had a balcony with beautiful, you know, like tropical outdoor area.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   I could go out and sit in the sunshine if I wanted, like a private terrace.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   They treated my wife so well while she was there.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   They gave her the-- we had the best food, the best coffee, the best anything you want.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   And it's not-- maybe that was part of the bill, but I don't think it was.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   I thought it was cultural.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   They see somebody who needs help, and they give help, and they're not motivated
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   with their handout asking for money every five minutes or limited by some insurance
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   company saying, "No, we're not going to-- we're going to deny that claim,"
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   or, "This is not medically necessary," or whatever.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   They just do it.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Yeah, it's certainly-- there's so many ways that you can think about that,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   but I like Mexicans.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   I've always had good experiences in the Mexican culture, and there is certainly,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   as you say, in the Latin cultures, there is a greater appreciation of family
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   and of relationship, and that does have ongoing effects in other areas of life.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   And then I think also one of the challenges or one of the things I've observed--
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I've never figured out why this is, but it just seems like, to me,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   from personal experience, it seems like you just simply get better customer
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   service in some cultures than you do in others.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I don't think the United States is the worst place in the world,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   but I'll tell you, if I have the choice ever to fly on either a Latin airline
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   or an Asian airline, I always choose that instead of an American carrier
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   just because the experience that you get with the customer service,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   from the flight attendants, the way that you're treated is night and day different.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   And I've heard-- I haven't really traveled in the regions of the world where they
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   say the customer service is legendarily worse than the U.S.,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   but it is refreshing to go into other cultures where you get much more of a sense
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   of warmth and caring than you often do in the United States.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   I would also add to that that, I mean, I've noticed this coming from Australia
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   to the U.S. is that, you know, you go to a restaurant and the table service you get
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   from the waiter or the waitress is outstanding, I mean,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   way better than we would ever get back in Australia.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   I mean, it's absolutely over the top amazing.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   But then the motivation is they want the tip.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And that's okay.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   I don't mind paying for quality because, at the end of the day,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   we all work hard.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   And so if we get to keep our money, we can choose where we want to spend it,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   and we're going to reward quality service.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   That's just the free market at work.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And I'm a huge free market advocate.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   So that, to me, is core to success here.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   The problem is when you don't have a free market, when it's being controlled
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   by like a corporatized environment or it's artificially manipulated
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   by government policy like it is, say, in medicine,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   and that's where things break down.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   And for that reason, I came up with this sort of methodology when it comes
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   to healthcare for myself, and I've been using it for a while,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   and that is to not try to think of healthcare as a one-size-fits-all system
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   but to break it up into three segments, which I call preventative,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   and that's the stuff that we all have responsible for our own biology,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   our own bodies.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   So you eat right, you go to the gym, you don't smoke,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   all the stuff that's good for you that we know is going to extend your life
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   and is going to keep a high quality of life.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And that stuff, look, I can go to 15 gyms within a 10-mile radius
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   of my house, and I can choose price and quality individually.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   So they all have to compete with each other,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   and consequently my monthly gym membership fee is fairly affordable.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   I can find -- you know, I can go to the country club gym if I want
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   to spend that money, or I can go to, you know, 24-hour fitness.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   It doesn't matter.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   I have the choice.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   So that's great for preventative.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   The second section I would call elective, and that's surgery that I'm going
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   to choose to have on my schedule, which is what the case was
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   with my shoulder.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   But it might be somebody, say, a hip, or it might be a knee arthroscopy,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   or it might be some other, you know, maybe cataract surgery, maybe dental.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   They can choose to get that done on their schedule,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   and they're in control of when to get it done.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And this is where I think there's a problem because 90% of the people
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   that I've spoken to in the U.S., when it comes to elective surgery,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   the first thing they do is they go to their health insurance provider
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   and find out, well, who's going to cover me for my hip replacement?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Well, firstly, here's the interesting dynamic,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   and I've done the math on this.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   An average cost of a hip replacement in the United States,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   and I've done research across about 10 different cases in hospitals
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   and so on, the average cost works out to about a $50,000 cost.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   If you go to Mexico in Guadalajara and you go into an orthopedic surgeon's
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   office, he will give you a menu, much like going to McDonald's, you know,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   you want the number two burger or whatever it is.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   He will give you a menu, and he will tell you a hip replacement
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   is $4,400 U.S. cash, and that's his fee.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   And if it takes longer, he eats it.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   You don't eat it.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And when you look at that price differential, it's less than a tenth
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   of the cost of the U.S., and all of a sudden it's like that guy,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   what's your business?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And the reason is you can go into that market and you can compare him
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   against the guy next door, against the guy in the hospital over there,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   against the guy over here, and you can choose based on price
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and quality and outcomes.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   You can even look at Yelp reviews on surgeons down there and find out
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   who's got the best review.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And that's important to me.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Again, it's a free market which keeps competitive pricing down
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   and quality up when it comes to elective.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And insurance, who cares when it's $4,400?
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   My deductible's $10,000.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   My entire shoulder replacement was less than my deductible here.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   So at that point, the power's back in you.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Now, God forbid you end up in an accident much like I had or you have
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   some chronic condition, you were born with a condition, you get cancer,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   you have a heart attack, all those things that none of us want anybody
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   to ever have to go through.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   But it's life.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   We're biological entities.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   We have a shelf life.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   We are going to go through those things to some degree.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   And at that point, what I would say is that's the choice when you don't
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   get to shop around for your physician or your hospital.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   It's like just take me somewhere and patch me up, please.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   And that's going to be when you need to lean on insurance.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And if we can somehow create a situation where we take control of our own
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   preventive responsibilities and we live a good life that way,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   and we take control of when we need elective surgery and we're willing
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   to pay for it ourself and we save money up to cover ourselves
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   and we only need an insurance for adverse events, well,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   if you count the number of times in your life that you've had an adverse event,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   then all of a sudden our insurance would drop down dramatically
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   if it only needed to cover that.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Do you label that as acute care?
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   What do you use for category number three in terms of your labeling?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I've been calling it adverse or chronic.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Okay.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Adverse or chronic, preventive, elective and adverse or chronic.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Yeah, I think, and interestingly,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   I think that is one of the areas where the U.S.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   American healthcare system really shines.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   I don't know this from data.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   This is just an impression.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   But it seems to me that if I'm in a car accident,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   I'd like to be in the U.S., right?
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   The surgeons and the life support and systems and whatnot are world class.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   It seems to me that they're really world class.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   And that seems to be where I think the -- where I have tremendous admiration
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   for the medical systems, the ER surgeons,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   the people who are involved in that kind of high-level acute care.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And the other areas seem to be -- the preventive certainly seems to be where
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   we don't do very well as a culture, and then the elective is kind of in and of itself.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   I don't know enough to categorize it on that.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   It is very frustrating being an advocate of free markets myself.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   It is often so difficult and frustrating to talk about the medical system
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   because it's not any one thing, right, especially in the U.S.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   It's not a government-run, taxpayer-run system with all of the associated problems
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   but advantages, but neither is it a free market system
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   with all of the associated advantages.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   It's like this monstrous hybrid that has a few good things
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   and a whole lot of bad things all mixed up together.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   So finding solutions to that is very daunting.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Well, I've always found in life that when I lose choice as a consumer
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   or as a purchaser of something, that that's when pricing is out of control,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and that's when I have really no say in the matter.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   So, you know, it might be, say, my internet service provider.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   If I only have one to choose from, they can charge me whatever they want,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   and I've got no choice in the matter.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   I have to pay it.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   And it's the same with most sole source markets.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   They're kind of things that if you can, you want to avoid them.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   You want to go to places where there's choice and price competitiveness
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   and quality competition and all of that.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And medical has so much of that except for adverse.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   And I think it's fair to say that adverse is not likely to be a good fit
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   for the free market economy.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   And for that reason, I do see a role of government
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   or some third party, insurance, whatever it might be,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   playing a role in provision of that care as long as it's never rationed
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   and it's not the – but there has to be conditions on this.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   You cannot use an emergency room as your entry into a healthcare procedure
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   unless you need to be there because it's an emergency.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   And that's where we've lost it because people who don't have insurance,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   who don't have, you know, money, well, they don't go to their urgent care
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   or their local GP or their, you know, family practitioner.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   They go to the ER room and they end up getting between a $5,000
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   and $2,000 bill for walking in because they've got, you know,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   bronchitis that could just need some antibiotics or something.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   I mean this is a drain on an industry that shouldn't be used that way.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   I agree.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   I don't know how to solve it, but what I do think is that as individuals –
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   so I don't know how to solve the whole economy, right?
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   But I do believe, I do trust that individuals can make intelligent decisions
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   for themselves in the midst of it.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   And so two comments.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   One, if I could – I was shopping health insurance prices
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   with a health insurance broker recently, and we were talking about it
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   just to see because I've grown rusty over the last few years
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   on the health insurance marketplace.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   But I was able to work out and get one quote on a policy with one broker
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   for something like a $100,000 deductible.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   And I've forgotten this now because it's been a few months
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   because I can't quote the prices.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   But I looked in and said, you know, how high could we get the deductibles?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Is there anything available in the marketplace?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And the best thing that I would like to see, especially for people
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   who have money, have savings, et cetera, is you just take on preventive
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   and elective care yourself and you self-insure through all of the
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   even major stuff, right?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Most wealthy people, you can self-insure a $10,000, a $20,000, a $30,000,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   a $40,000 risk.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   But if you can just have that coverage from $50,000 to $5 million, right?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   That's the coverage that you need.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   And that's where insurance is the perfect fit.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   It's the perfect solution.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   That's where insurance really shines is protecting from catastrophic,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   very unlikely, very--well, things that only affect a few people
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   but are catastrophes, that's where insurance is the perfect design.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   And then everything else can just be out of pocket.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   But I think that that's only accessible to people, especially in the U.S.,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   if they understand that there are other options.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   You can go to Mexico for your elective surgery.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   You can go to Costa Rica for your dental work.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   You can go to Brazil for your plastic surgery.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   You can go to Malaysia for your heart treatment.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And by the time that you factor in, even with all the other costs,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   with a lot of these things, you factor in airplane flights,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   you factor in hotel and lodging, there's still such a dramatic
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   price differential that if you're paying for yourself,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   you definitely should consider it and price it out.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   And I think this will be--it is a growing industry in my understanding,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   and I think it'll be a growing industry in the future.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   How much did you estimate your surgery would have cost you
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   if you had just bought it in the United States?
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Yeah, that was a very interesting bit of research because I had no--
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   and this brings up a very good point about insurance versus cash.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   And I think--I know in past programs you've talked about this,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   but it's absolutely true.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   In the case of medicine, being a cash customer is not an advantage at all.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Right.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   The problem is you don't have any negotiating power on contract pricing
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   because you're just a guy with some money in their pocket,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   and the medical industry sees you as a good extortion target.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   They want that money and everything else you got.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   I mean, that's just the way it works.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   So in that regard, when I went shopping to try to price this surgery out--
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   and, look, my surgery required a total shoulder replacement.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   It required removal of previous work that was done, the pins.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   It required a lot of cleanup work.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   So all of those factors were in there.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   I shopped around and I went online.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   I said, "What's the cost of a total shoulder?"
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   And the insurance companies who negotiate down the prices will tell you,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   "Ah, $25,000 to $30,000, somewhere around there."
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   That's if you've got insurance.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Well, I don't because it's preexisting.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   They're not going to touch it.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   They won't even give me access to contract pricing.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   I can't do anything like that.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   So I went back to a friend of mine who's a doctor in Southern California,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   and I said to him, "Look, you're on the inside.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Can you tell me what you think this procedure would cost me?"
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   And so a day or so later, he got back to me and he said, "Yeah."
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   I called around.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   I spoke to a friend of mine who's an orthopedic surgeon,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   and we looked at what you were doing, and we think looking at the hospital cost,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   the anesthesiologist, the surgical team, probably $125,000, and I was floored.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Wow.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   I'm like, "Are you serious?"
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   He goes, "Yeah, that would be a normal charge for something along those lines."
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   And so I said, "But I'm paying $10,000," and then the phone went, like, dead.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Wow.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   He had to kind of pick himself off the floor and go, "Are you kidding?"
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   I'm like, "No, that's what they're charging me."
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   And this was before I had the surgery.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   So the funny thing is after I'd finished the surgery and I was being discharged,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   they wheel you out of the hospital and they take you straight to the finance
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   department, right, because you've got to pay the bill.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   And here I am with my visa card in hand, and the lady, she spoke perfect English,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   and she was telling me she must have lived in California for, like, 10 years
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   and then went back to Mexico, and she was telling me about all this sort of stuff.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And so she's working on the computer and punching all these buttons,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   and the next thing you know she presses the button to print,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   and I see the laser printer spitting out, like, 10 pages of bill, everything,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   just 10 pages of every single thing they ever did in the hospital.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   And she comes up and she gives me some huge number, and, of course,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   it's in pesos.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Well, U.S. dollar, how much are we talking about?
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Now, I'd already paid $1,200 as a deposit to go in there,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   and the balance left over was $3850 or something like that.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   So let's say $5,000 for the hospital.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   And I thought, "Wow, that's incredible."
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And I was in hospital for two nights, so three days,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   and all the surgical stuff and whatever.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   And then so I paid that, and then I got back to the doctor's office
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   a day or so later, and he was checking on the stitches
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   and all the stuff they did.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   And I said, "Listen, I need to settle up with you.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   I mean, how much do I owe?"
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   And he goes, "Well, the prosthetic, we had to buy that separately.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   It was all custom built, and the surgical team need to be paid.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   So on your way out, go see the lady at the desk,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   and she'll give you the bill."
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   And here I am with my Visa card in hand again.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   I go to her, and I say, "All right, how much?"
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   She rattles off this massive number in pesos, and we worked out.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   The whole thing was like, I don't know, about another five grand or something,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   a little bit less than that.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   So I paid it gladly.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   What's scary about doing business in Mexico is they use the dollar sign
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   exactly the same as they do in the United States.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   So it doesn't say 5,000 Mexican pesos.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   It says $5,000.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   So you look at the pricing, and a lot of times there's no indication.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   It doesn't say USD or MEX.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   It just says a dollar sign and 5,000.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Then you have to go and pull out your app and say, "Oh, okay, good.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   This is Mexican dollars instead of U.S. dollars."
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   I remember the first time I was in Mexico, just everywhere I'm thinking,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   "They use the same dollar sign.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   How do I know the difference?"
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   I know.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   You know what's really funny?
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   This is kind of not related specifically to the medical side of things,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   but you know how I paid for this?
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   How's that?
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   I paid for it with Bitcoin.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Really?
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   Wow.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   I had done really well.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   I had some Bitcoin investments for a long, long time ago,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   and I bought a bunch of real estate when I sold it all in 2017.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   I had a few bits of leftover change from this sitting on a hardware wallet
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   somewhere, and it just so happens that, I don't know,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   somebody blessed me with a Bitcoin and went to $12,000 again.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   I said, "Well, let me see what sort of loose change I've got lying around
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   the couch."
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   I had enough money in Bitcoin to pay for the whole procedure.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   That's great.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   The funny thing is I said to the surgeon after the surgery, I said,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   "You're going to get a laugh out of this,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   but I'm paying for the whole thing in Bitcoin."
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   His ears pricked up, and he wanted to hear the whole thing about it.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   He says, "We need to start taking Bitcoin down here."
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   I'm thinking, "Yeah, you do, buddy."
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   That'd be great.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   That'd be great.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   I'd like to make good use of our time and kind of change here.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   The net summary, my net summary, you can say yes or no.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   My net summary is so far you've had a great experience.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   You were able to get a quality surgery that you needed.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   You were able to get a great price, and things are better,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   and you'd do it again if you had to.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Is that a good summary?
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Yes, sir.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Absolutely.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   All right.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   That's valuable to share, and I think that there are many people
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   who have family members and who are listeners
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   who probably have things that they could have done.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   They'd like to have that surgery.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   They'd like to have plastic surgery,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   or they'd like to have a certain procedure,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   like you said, a hip replacement or something done,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   and yet they've not thought of doing it.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   They know they don't have the money for it.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Well, look around the world, because in today's world,
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   you can get on an airplane, and within 24 hours,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   you can be on just about any corner of the globe.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   It's pretty incredible.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   What that means is that now you have the opportunity
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   to access these markets.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   What I think people are often underappreciative of is they think
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   that they're somehow falling behind in medical knowledge
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   in other places.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   In reality, sometimes it's the opposite.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Sometimes you'll have great doctors and poor doctors
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   anywhere in the world, just like with anything else,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   but my experience being just simply a layperson
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   who's not really qualified to address competence has been--
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   I've been impressed by doctors I've met all over the world.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   If you trust yourself a little bit to go with your feelings,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   go with whatever external data you can gather,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   do the reviews, et cetera, but we're in a world
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   of increasing competition, and you can use that
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   to have some solutions to your medical problems,
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   especially--and you may be able to afford it
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   if you're traveling around the world.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   I remember years ago I read on Bumfuzzle,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   on the Bumfuzzle blog, Patrick and Ali Schulte.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   They were out traveling around the world for years,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   and they came back to the United States,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   and they were going to have a baby,
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   and they didn't have any insurance,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   and so they went to Mexico to have the baby.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   The benefits of that--and I think in her case
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   she had a C-section--their C-section bill was,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   I think, $3,000.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Those of us who've had babies in the United States know
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   that if you have a C-section, you're in the tens of thousands
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   of dollars very quickly, $20,000 to $30,000.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   That's just too big of a risk,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   especially if you're uninsured.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   Obviously, I try to be a prudent person,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   but there have been times in my life where I'm uninsured.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   I've been uninsured from a health insurance perspective,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   and I don't think it's as big of a risk
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   as it's often laid out to be.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Certainly it's a risk, but in life we take risks.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   So if you find yourself in a situation where you're uninsured
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   or uninsurable, look around the world.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   If you're going to have a baby, go have the baby in Mexico.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   Get some immigration benefits out of it.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   You have a nice Mexican baby instead of just an American baby,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   and also it can help you to cover you.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   It is really nice, especially if you're coming from a wealthy country
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   or you're earning in American dollars in the United States
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   or other places in the world.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   It's really nice to go to a place where you can have work done
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   and not worry about what the bill is that's going to show up,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   because it's within your comfort level.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   You can be in the hospital for days,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   and you're not worried about it.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Now, I can't solve why that is the case in the United States,
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   but I know I can solve it for you in some circumstances
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   if you'll expand your ideas around the globe.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Anything else that you'd like to add on medical tourism
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   before we switch to fire, Myles?
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   Well, it's interesting that there are some overlaps with medical tourism
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   and financial independence, because I would not have been able
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   to have the opportunity to go to Mexico and do the research
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   if I had to report for work every day at 9 o'clock.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   We give up so much of our freedom with this kind of social mantra of work
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   that we lose the opportunities.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   And if you only get a couple of weeks' vacation a year
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   and you're going to spend a week of it travelling to Malaysia
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   to get research medical procedures or something along those lines,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   it's very difficult to be able to achieve that.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   You almost feel like you're stuck in the system,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   kind of like a prisoner that can never get out.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   And when they get out, they get drawn back in or something.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   It's a very, very tough world.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   You need to have life freedom to be able to get life in this case.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   It's just part of it.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Otherwise, you're just going to fall back on your local hospital,
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   your local insurance, and you won't get a choice.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Yeah, there's no question.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   That absolutely is one of the many costs of working,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   being forced to a limited constraint when you go on vacation.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Everyone else is on vacation too, because especially if you have children,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   you're doing things on school calendars and you're limited vacation.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   You wind up--that's the thing about travel.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   I don't know how it's extremely difficult when you're stuck
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   in a very short vacation window to travel effectively
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   because you wind up spending lots and lots of money
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   to do things at certain specific times,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   and you've got to do everything fast, and so you wind up spending tons of money,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   whereas those who have built time flexibility into their life--
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   it can be through financial independence,
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   it can be through self-employment, it can be through seasonal work, etc.--
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   you can make the money stretch much farther.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   So certainly it's a good point.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   Miles, you call your blog Be Unconstrained,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   and you've got this liberty-oriented bent.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   I think that's why we have some things in common.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   How do you look at the world when it comes to your own personal liberty,
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   and what choices are you making to expand your liberty?
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   Well, I'm a firm believer that the buck stops on my desk
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   with anything I choose and decide on,
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   so that kind of is my starting point.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   I also believe that--I don't know.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   I mean, it's very easy for people who have--
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   I come from a country with 25 million people living in it.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   It's not a very big place, and in that sort of country,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   you kind of make the rules up as you go along.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   I haven't lived there for a long time,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   but when I grew up in the '70s and the '80s in Australia,
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   there was no internet.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   There was no world travelers so much.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   Everybody just sort of worked it out,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   and we were an island isolated unto ourselves,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   and we had to--there were rules.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   I mean, you know, there were government-imposed rules.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   There were social, cultural rules or whatever,
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   but for the most part, everything was a pragmatic decision
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   based on what's going to fix a problem right now
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   or what's going to avoid one for the future.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   We didn't predispose anybody's future based on education or work or whatever,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   and I kind of embraced that.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   The other thing which affected my thinking in regards to that,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   and particularly regarding liberty, was what I saw my father go through,
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   and it's not a story I tell all that often, but I'll share it here.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   My father worked for the same company for 40-odd years before he retired,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   and I remember the day he retired, he got himself, you know,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   the traditional gold watch and what they call a superannuation plan down there,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   which is like a pension, I guess, or like a 401(k) thing,
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   and my mother and him managed to go to Europe for six weeks
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   and had a great time traveling, as you probably would do at the end of retirement,
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   but two years later, he died, and I had to be the guy to identify the body
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   and bury him, and I went through that whole process,
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   and I'm an only child, so it all ended up on my shoulders.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   So, I walked through that whole process, and then, you know,
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   you go through the scientific, pragmatic, well, what killed him?
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   What did he die of?
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   And the doctor said we had a heart attack and he died.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Well, what we find out is that many years before that,
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   he always had problems with his lungs.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   He was always coughing, and I never really realized what it was.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   I just thought the guy had, you know, he was at a very young age.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   He was like most people in the, I guess, in the 30s and 40s.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   He was a smoker like everybody was back then,
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   and I thought maybe that was something to do with it.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   Well, it wasn't.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   He worked for a very large corporation that was nationwide in Australia
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   that made building products, and one of the key products
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   that they were experts in was roofing,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   and the particular product he was exposed to was asbestos.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   And so, for most of his working career in the 40-odd years he worked
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   in this corporation, and he subscribed to the, you know,
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   the company will always look after me and I'm a company man, and, you know,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   he was a very loyal employee to that.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   The company screwed him over.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   I mean, they killed him.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   They didn't know they were doing it for a lot of the time, but they knew,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   just like, you know, how Philip Morris and all of the tobacco companies
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   got caught out, they knew for the last, say,
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   10 years that they were selling that product, that it wasn't good,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   that it was carcinogenic, that it shouldn't have been on the market,
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   and they eventually pulled it, and he just got the raw deal
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   and died of asbestosis of the lung, of cancer.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   And I kind of watched that, and I guess maybe I was about 20 years old
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   when I had to, you know, put him to rest and everything,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   and I realized I don't want to go down that path.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   I don't want that to be my life.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   I don't want to be --
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   it's not about financial independence.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   It's about independence.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   I don't want to be relying on any third party for anything.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   I don't want to rely on government.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   I don't want to rely on banks.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   I don't want to rely on the Federal Reserve.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   I don't want to rely on corporations.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   I sure do not want to rely on a boss who I have less respect for, you know,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   who's holding my paycheck above my head saying, "You better do this
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   or you're not getting it."
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   I mean, I don't want that life.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   I want freedom.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   And then having made that decision, I looked at this whole social mantra,
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   this cultural social norm that we've sold ourselves and our kids,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   and I realized it just didn't fit me, this go to school until you're, I don't know,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   18 years old and then choose whether you want to go into the trades
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   or you want to go back into college and then go and do another four or six
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   or eight years more of tertiary education.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   And I thought, well, that's admirable if I want to be an architect or a lawyer
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   or an accountant or a doctor or something like that.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Yeah, that works really, really well for that.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   But what if I just want to be me?
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   I just want to be a human being and have a good life and look after a family.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   And I'm not afraid to work hard and I'm not afraid to be smart and learn
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   and read and study because life and education doesn't end at the age of 22.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   My daughter just graduated this year, and part of the reason I did my blog was more
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   of a service to her.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   I realized, you know what, I'm 54 years old.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   She ain't going to listen to me.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   She's not going to listen to my life stories and what I've learned because I'm just dad.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   You know, I'm not important.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   But what she might do is one day, maybe if I could tell everybody else this story,
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   she might look at it then and go, hey, maybe he wasn't such a dumbass in the end anyway.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   Maybe he did have something to say.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   Maybe the fact that he lived a life without having to work for a boss and, you know,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   he has his freedom.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   I kind of grew up with that and thought that was normal.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   But now I'm working for American Express every day and I'm stuck in a cubicle somewhere.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   I start realizing how it's not normal.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   I wanted her to realize that although I put her through college and paid for her education
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   and everything, that 85% of all of her peers walked out of that college degree
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   with student loan debt and won't be able to participate with real estate market speculation
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   and buy gold or, you know, invest in Japanese corporations or whatever they want to do that might be their form
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   of risk management and asset acquisition or whatever.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   They can't participate in that because they've got this albatross on their back that they can't get rid of.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   And that's not right because half of the degrees those kids came out with,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   they're never going to work in that field or they're going to come out like half
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   of her class, graduating class of 20,000 at the University of Arizona this year,
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   that I watched them all come out, a bunch of them got, you know, picked up by Goldman Sachs.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   She did a business major.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   And so they're going to go to Wall Street and work for Goldman Sachs and they're going to be,
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   "Whoa, look at me.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   I've, you know, got this great job."
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   Yeah, and you've got an $8,000 a month apartment and you can't afford this and you can't afford that,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   but you've got this great job.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   And then three or four years they're going to go, "You know, I'm miserable working on Wall Street.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   I want to get out of Wall Street.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   What am I doing this?"
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   "Well, because I got student loan debt."
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   "Well, because I got" -- you know, it's like at what point is this not stupid?
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   It's just insane to not question this and say, you know, who's responsible for you?
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   Who makes your life choices?
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   Is it you or is it social culture and social norms?
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   Are your parents telling you to do these things because they really don't have the answer themselves
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   and that they went through that process and therefore they're just trying to do the same thing for you,
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   stay in school, get a degree, get a good job, work hard.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   You know, you'll be fine.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   At the age of 65, you'll retire and you'll get your pension and let's God forbid hope you don't die in two years.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   Now, I know I'm an outlier.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   I know I'm really odd.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   But when I see people coming out of the financial independence or the FIRE movement
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   and I understand that they're sensing something's not right
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   and they're trying to do something atypical to break the mold, I applaud them.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   I absolutely applaud them.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   But I also am so cautious that they don't go into the process of welcoming themselves into a cult-based,
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   faith-oriented movement that says you too can retire at the age of 38.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   Because I can tell you right now, at the age of 38, you don't want to be retiring
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   because you shouldn't be working for money.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   You know, there's so many better reasons for you to work and so many better reasons for you to be a better person
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   and to really extend yourself and it shouldn't be all about money.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   So if they say, "I don't want to retire early, but I want to be financially independent
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   so I can go out there and pursue the world and be Ernest Hemingway and be Marco Polo
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   and be these great people who travel and embrace the world and be, as I say, unconstrained
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   and not shackled down by anything, they can have a life worth living and that's all I want
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   and that's all I wanted for my daughter and one day maybe she'll listen.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   You're in that, if you just graduated from college, you're in that time where you don't get a lot of feedback,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   you just got to wait.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   And then I think in general, at least if our experience with our parents is any indication,
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   you start to recognize that your parents get smarter as the years go by.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   So it will return.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   And I realize that everybody, you know, me sitting here on your podcast talking about all these things
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   and proliferating my views on what the world is and all these sort of things,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   they're not going to resonate with everybody.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   People are going to question me and think, oh, he's an idiot, he's crazy.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   Who would do those sorts of things?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   But I just ask somebody to look in their own backyard and question whether they're living in a house
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   with a garage full of stuff they never should have bought in the first place
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   or they're living a life they're not happy with.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   They're going to work and they're stuck in traffic, they're stuck in a gridlock
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   and they can't seem to escape it.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   So I say don't question me, question that and find out what the answer to solve that is
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   and then you'll have your own answers and you won't have to worry about my position and stuff.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   It does seem obvious that on – I see examples on every hand that it's more unusual for me today
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   to find somebody who – most people that I meet question.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   Everyone feels like something's wrong, right?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   Something's wrong with the way that our modern society is fracturing people up,
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   is pushing people into certain lifestyles that are just fundamentally in some ways unhealthy for humanity.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   And so everybody's looking for solutions to some of these problems
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   and some people find financial solutions, some people find religious solutions,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   some people find familial solutions, but many people seem to be looking for solutions.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   I'm optimistic. I think that with the ability that we have to proliferate information and ideas,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   from your wacky ideas to my wacky ideas, then more people are trying new things
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   and there's never before been a time where you could be exposed to more interesting, innovative ideas,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   whether that's to live in the city, live in a van, make half a million dollars and retire,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   or that's move to the country, live in a self-built hut and retire that way
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   or in almost any permutation thereof.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   So I am excited that I do see a major groundswell of interest in these topics and looking for solutions.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   But I just want to close this out here by simply saying,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   being a man who retired at 32, went from zero to hero, then back to zero,
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   then over the years building up another portfolio, as you said, 54 now,
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   your daughter's graduated from college, that puts you in a new phase of life.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   Where do you think you'll go from here and why?
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   Well, I don't really have, I'm very lucky.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   I learned this trick many years ago, which I call financial sustainability.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   And it's the ability for you to earn money when you're asleep and to make sure that the amount of money that you're earning,
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   and people call that passive income, but I do it through real estate or I do it through vending machines
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   or other forms of investments which generate income on their own.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   I don't rely on Wall Street or stock markets or anything like that.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   I do everything under my own control.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   But I've created a situation where the amount of income that I bring in every month is equal to my burn rate,
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   what my cost of living is.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   So I live neutral.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   I don't have any costs.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   I don't need to work.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   I choose to because there are certain projects in the world that I really want to embrace.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   As I get older, I notice my assets grow and they've grown to the point now where I could just sell everything up and go
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   and live on an island somewhere, I guess, but that would be very boring.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   What I'm starting to see is that there's a role for me that isn't about choosing something to do that has a dollar sign attached to it.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   It's about an ability to give back.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   And my wife is very much of the same belief.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   We both were raised as Christians and we're both of the belief that you give when you can.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   And in our particular case, we find ourselves in a place where we're lucky.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   We've paid our house off.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   We've got some rental properties.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   We've got income.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   Our daughter's already finished college.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   We don't need to work, but we still have that yearning need to be of service.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   And so one of the things we discovered in our recent trips, we were down in San Miguel in Mexico and meeting up with a bunch of other expats,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   which I absolutely enjoyed.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   It was fantastic down there.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   But we found places where they were providing service back to the community.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   There's a long tradition of that down in that town.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   And we sort of thought, you know what, there's a role for us here.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   My wife is a wonderful clothing designer, and she wants to be able to do work with the local communities of artisans and to encourage people who may not have financial wherewithal.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   Or she wants to go and volunteer at an orphanage down there and work.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   What I discovered was that with my work in the computer industry, I do a lot of work with school districts, and they turf out thousands of two-year-old laptops onto the auction market, and I happen to have an inroad to that.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   So my goal is to buy pallet loads of these computers and ship them down there and start a little operation where I can refurbish these machines and give them out to kids and teach them how to use technology.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   I want to give back.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   I don't want money.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   I don't need money.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   But I need something that is more -- I have to transcend that.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   I have to -- I'm like Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   I want to get to the top here.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   And the best thing I can do is I have to give back.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   It's my turn to give back now.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   Yeah, as it should be.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   Absolutely.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   Miles, thank you for coming on.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   I've enjoyed your writing.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   I thank you for reaching out to me and interacting with me online.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   That was how we developed a relationship.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   And I'll just point out to you that the way that Miles wound up on Radical Personal Finance today, I get -- just so you know -- I mean, I would imagine -- I don't know if you know or not, Miles, but I get lots and lots of requests every single day from people who are asking me to be on Radical Personal Finance.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   I just ignore them all.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   I ignore them all.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   But what I don't ignore is when people actually engage with something.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   And so the way that you ended up here today having this conversation was that you started reaching out to me.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   We started chatting back and forth on Twitter, copied me on some of your articles, started reading your articles, enjoyed it, and enjoyed your story.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   And then over time, that led to you wrote me an email and said, "Hey, would you like me to come on and tell the story?
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   It's a story that fits the audience."
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   And that's why I had you on.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   So you're doing a masterful job with your marketing there.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   Tell my audience.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   Beunconstrained.com.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   You also have a podcast.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   The podcast is a blog, and feel free to share anything else that you think my audience would be interested in, please.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   Yeah, I'm cursed by the -- I talk too much.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   So I thought, "Hey, why not turn that into a podcast?"
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   So, yeah, I created a podcast about probably three or four months ago called The Unconstrained Podcast.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   And my goal was to talk about the methods and techniques that I've used that have got me to where I am and to try to create a sense of community where others that are on the same path can tell their stories and can tell their wins and their failures because I think community is what it's all about.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   I'm a big believer in decentralization and to make everything a local experience, and podcasts gives you that opportunity.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   So, yeah, The Unconstrained Podcast and all the links to it are at beunconstrained.com.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   They're on iTunes and Google Podcasts and Stitcher and all that stuff.
