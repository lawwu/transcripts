[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.760]   - All right, Jesse, that's what we got for sponsors.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.960]   I think we have time for one more caller.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.680]   Who do we have here for our final caller?
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.640]   - All right, final call.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.960]   We have Walker.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.240]   It's basically about your tagline,
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.800]   do better, do less, know why.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.480]   And he's also has a question about the journey
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.640]   of his medical student career.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.480]   - Okay.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.120]   - Hi, Cal, my name's Walker.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.320]   And I've actually had the privilege of you answering
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.880]   a few of my questions on the podcast before.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.840]   They were extremely helpful, so thanks for that.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.040]   My questions today arise as a bit of a related
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.640]   set of questions to that.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.920]   Namely that philosophically, how do you square the maximum
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.640]   of doing better, doing less, and knowing why
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.080]   with the journey of a pre-medical student?
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.560]   I ask this because if you ask any pre-med students,
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.840]   traditional or not, they can attest to the slew
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.800]   of expectations proposed by admissions committees,
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.640]   advisors, et cetera, that require you to excel
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.960]   in the classroom and work, research,
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.560]   clinical and non-clinical volunteering,
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200]   and perhaps curing cancer and winning
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.640]   an Olympic gold medal on the side.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.400]   How does that square with your maximum?
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.160]   Is it a contradiction?
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.480]   Does it hold up as an exception to the rule?
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.160]   Curious to your thoughts on this.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.000]   And then specifically, how might you advise someone
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.480]   in my situation working full-time and trying to fit in
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.720]   all of these goals and accomplish them and achieve them?
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.560]   Thanks.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.600]   - Well, Walker, it's a good question.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.360]   We're talking about admissions here.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.120]   We're talking about academic admissions
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.720]   and how that fits with the old motto of my website,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.400]   and I would say sort of the new motto
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.880]   of the deep life writ large, which is to do less,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.240]   do better, know why.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.600]   Two points about pre-med.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.280]   Number one, in the vast majority of cases,
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.320]   the thing that is vastly most important
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.560]   is your grades and MCATs.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   Get good grades, get good MCATs.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.400]   That's what's gonna matter for almost any medical school,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.240]   especially for you.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.360]   You're working full-time and you wanna go back to med school.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.680]   That's basically what you have, the knobs you have to turn.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.520]   Yeah, your grades, those are probably already set.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.840]   You wanna get good MCAT scores,
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.520]   and you get good MCAT scores by practicing on actual tests,
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.880]   deliberately improving your skills
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.880]   until you can get the score you want under time conditions.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.080]   There's no shortcut for actually practice, get better,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.920]   practice, get better,
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.680]   until you can consistently hit the score you want.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.280]   So that's probably what you need to do.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.440]   Does that take a small number of med schools
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.280]   off the table?
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.520]   Probably.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.960]   There are a small number of med schools
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.640]   where there is such selective admissions
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.160]   that everyone might be,
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.600]   you could fill a whole class with people
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.800]   who have pegged their grades and MCATs,
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.560]   so they have to use other factors to differentiate.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.320]   Well, that's probably not gonna be the med school
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.400]   where you're gonna go.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   That's fine.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.280]   Go to a good med school, pick up the skills,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.200]   create a good career as a doctor.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.240]   Now let's step back and say you're in a situation
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.160]   where you wanna try to get into one of those top med schools
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.560]   and you think stuff beyond just your grades and MCATs
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.400]   are gonna matter.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.200]   Well, I wrote a whole book about this for college admissions
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.720]   but the same ideas apply to,
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.360]   let's say, medical school admissions.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.200]   Now that book was called
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.720]   "How to Become a High School Superstar"
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.080]   or "How to Be a High School Superstar."
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.560]   I forgot which verb it was.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.960]   And it got into what makes people impressive.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.640]   And it was looking at it
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.040]   from the standpoint of college admissions,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.400]   but again, I think this is similar
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.640]   to these type of highly competitive med school admissions.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.480]   And it said, again, put aside grades and test scores
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.120]   are 99% of the battle, so that's destiny.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.880]   But beyond that, what can you do?
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.400]   And the answer came down to, guess what?
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.860]   Do less, do better, know why.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.840]   This idea, we write these storylines
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.440]   that somehow the quantity of things we do is impressive
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.240]   because, wow, it's so hard to do a lot of things,
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.760]   but that does not correctly characterize
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.080]   how we assess impressiveness.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.200]   You're gonna be assessed more on the thing you do best
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.560]   and how interesting or unexplainable it is.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.400]   Do less things, do the things you do at a really high level
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.160]   and have a really good reason for doing it
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.480]   is what's gonna play.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.760]   That's what's going to impress people.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.440]   Not that I did seven different things.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   And so there's a lot of ideas in that book
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.520]   about how to do this.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.640]   First of all, it tells you to become interesting.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.480]   You have to be an actual interesting person,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.400]   which means you probably have to do less
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.800]   'cause you need time to read and explore
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.000]   and go to talks and have thoughts
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.680]   and develop interests that are non-artificial.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.800]   And that's hard for a lot of people,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.200]   but doing less is the foundation
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.400]   for becoming more interesting,
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.680]   which allows you to get some attention.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.080]   And when it comes time to do better,
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.840]   the book talks about when you have an interest,
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.040]   you follow that particular interest to interesting places.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.640]   And you can't plan it all out in advance,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.200]   but you do it really well, that opens up opportunities.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.840]   You take one of those opportunities,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.920]   you do that really well, that opens up new opportunities.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.560]   And what you really wanna try to do,
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.440]   according to that book,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.080]   is trigger what is called the failed simulation effect.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.040]   Eventually get to a place where people say,
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.200]   I can't even understand how Walker did this.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.600]   Like I wouldn't even know how to go about doing that.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   And that triggers a much more bigger burst
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.560]   of impressiveness than instead trying to go
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.320]   into a direction with an incredibly well-defined
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.040]   competitive structure, like being an athlete,
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.000]   and saying, okay, my goal is to win that structure
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.240]   and be an Olympic athlete.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.960]   Yeah, one person succeeds at that, so good luck.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.080]   It's much better to go this failed simulation route,
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.680]   where instead you say, yeah, you know, I wrote a book,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.400]   and like have this podcast and wrote a book.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   Like, I don't even know how a young guy writes a book.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.320]   That's really impressive,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.840]   even if it was actually in terms of net effort,
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.520]   way easier than becoming an Olympic athlete.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.000]   So that book gets into a lot of these type of ideas.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.320]   So don't just assume you know really
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.800]   what makes people impressive beyond their test scores
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.880]   and grades in these contexts.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.320]   Usually people construct these stories
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.600]   as a self-defense mechanism.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.320]   I mean, Walker, what you were saying there,
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.080]   the way you listed what you have to do to med school,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.800]   to me just felt a little bit like self-defense.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.360]   Let me just list things I know like it would be implausible
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.720]   for me to do, so there's some protection there.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.040]   Impressiveness is a squirrelly subject, my friend,
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.000]   it's not as cut and dry as in clearly defined
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.200]   competitive structures, how high are you?
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   Or in terms of sheer difficulty of number of things you did,
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.760]   how many did you do?
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.360]   There's room there for creativity and unusual and uniqueness
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.720]   and that's the path that most people need to go.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.000]   So get your grades and test scores,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.520]   that'll determine your score.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.720]   If you're one of the few number of people
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.560]   where you actually have to add activities,
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.440]   it's better to be an interesting person who did less,
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.880]   but did the things they did really well
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.040]   and took them to interesting places.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.000]   It's a more interesting life and it's more refreshing
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and interesting to those admissions officers.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.680]   So a lot of thoughts to say about those types
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680]   of admission processes,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.160]   but we have a lot of learning to do on it.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.840]   So that book is a good place to start,
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.440]   but for you Walker, if you're working full time,
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.640]   don't worry about it, get your MCAT scores good,
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   go to a good school, try not to take on too much debt,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.360]   you know, do very well in that med school
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.960]   so you get matched into a good residency.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.800]   Good things will happen from there.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.400]   (upbeat music)
