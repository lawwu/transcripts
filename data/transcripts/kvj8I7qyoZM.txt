[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Does Cal still think that productivity is overrated?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.880]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.680]   the show about living and working deeply
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.520]   in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.520]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.680]   I'm joined, as always, by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.520]   How's it going?
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.800]   You know, Jesse, there's something we did,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200]   actually something we failed to do last week
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.040]   that sent me down a rabbit hole in the days that followed.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.360]   So I don't know if you remember this,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.520]   but we had a website,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.260]   I think it was like an archived version of my website
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.760]   we were gonna bring up onto the screen
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.480]   because I wanted to show how I used to have
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.120]   affiliate links on my website.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.680]   And it didn't work because it was using
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.320]   the Wayback Machine, which has frames,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.640]   and somehow it puts the old version within frames.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.200]   It didn't really work with our tablets.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.840]   We moved past it.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.920]   Setting up for that, though,
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.680]   got me thinking about the old days of calnewport.com.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.640]   You know, I started that website in 2007.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.600]   It was a blog early on for a while.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.480]   Now it's a blog/email newsletter
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.160]   that is still going on strong today.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.720]   But I was going back through the archives,
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.480]   and it was kind of nice, actually,
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.160]   to re-encounter some of the early things I wrote
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.200]   that at the time hit a chord.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.800]   So back in 2007 or 2008 hit a chord.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.000]   And so here's one I came across.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.840]   I'm gonna load it up.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.760]   We'll go down memory lane here.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.600]   Here's an article.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   For those who are watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.320]   this is episode 235.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.640]   So if you're watching, you'll see this.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.760]   If you're not, I'll narrate what's going on.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.480]   I have an article on the screen from calnewport.com
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.160]   from August 31st, 2007.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.440]   This is early calnewport.com.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.420]   I started it, I think, early that summer.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.040]   The title of this piece was
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.040]   dangerous ideas colon productivity is overrated.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.520]   Now I wanna actually just touch on a few points
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.160]   from this article because it's gonna lead us
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.200]   to the question I wanna dive deeply into in today's episode.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.040]   But let me just touch on a few of these points.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.800]   First of all, I just wanna say right off the bat,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.960]   I say I should be careful here.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.480]   Much of my livelihood as a writer
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.840]   depends on my good-natured efforts
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.640]   to help fellow students be more productive.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.720]   So let's put ourselves in the context of 2007 Cal.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.780]   I'm writing for students, I'm giving advice to students.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.060]   It was much more narrow back then.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.220]   All right, so here's the argument I make.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.300]   Productivity is important for being successful,
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.220]   but its role in this endeavor
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.800]   is often blown out of proportion.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.500]   Some of the most accomplished people I know
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.460]   are incredibly disorganized.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.840]   They work at the last minute, they stay up all night,
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.780]   they constantly scramble to find what they're looking for,
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.780]   but they still get it done.
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.620]   Other accomplished people
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.480]   are incredibly organized what gives.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.740]   Now I have to say, looking back at the time period
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.020]   in which I'm writing this, 2007,
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.660]   early in my academic career,
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.460]   I had just finished the course portion
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.860]   of my doctoral work at MIT.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.880]   I was done with my courses and doing research full-time.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.880]   I'm sure I was being influenced by the professors around me.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.500]   MIT, Computer Science Artificial Intelligence Lab,
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.180]   in the theory group within that lab where I worked,
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.260]   had some straight up capital B brilliant professors,
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.380]   and they were all really disorganized.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.980]   And so I'm sure that was influencing me
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.540]   'cause I was looking around.
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.700]   My definition of accomplishment in 2007
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.300]   was these MacArthur Genius Grant
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.800]   Turing Award winning professors
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.060]   who were killing it in the research literature,
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.680]   whose desk looked as if there had been
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.300]   some sort of disaster at a paper factory,
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.480]   and the rescue crews were on the way to dig through it
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.460]   to try to find survivors in the rubble.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.340]   And yet they were still winning all these major awards.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.220]   So I was being surrounded by this idea
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.020]   that organization has very little to do
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.300]   with whether or not you end up being successful.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.460]   So in this article, I said,
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.460]   "Let me distill this into two underlying truths.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.420]   Number one, being productive does not make you accomplished,
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.860]   but number two, it does, however,
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.340]   make being accomplished less stressful."
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.620]   That was my best read on the quest
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.460]   to pursue productivity advice
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.860]   and put more productive habits into your professional life.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.140]   My best read in 2007 is this is about
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.600]   making your work less stressful, organizing your efforts.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.300]   It is, however, orthogonal to whether or not
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.000]   you end up accomplishing important things.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.680]   As I go on to clarify, or let's say elaborate,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.860]   is what you need to be successful
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.360]   is a drive to keep working with a laser-like intensity
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.160]   on something even after you've lost immediate interest,
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.980]   tenacity, a grating thirst to get it done.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.340]   These are the precursors of accomplishments.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.540]   Having good productivity habits
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.520]   complement this crucial skill.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.200]   They take this intensity and place it in a schedule.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.980]   They keep small things from crowding your mind.
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.620]   They eliminate the stress of what appointment
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.900]   you might be forgetting or what vital errand has to be done,
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.900]   but productivity is not a substitute for this work.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.180]   I thought that was an interesting article.
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.220]   I mean, first of all, let me just say,
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.700]   and Jesse, if you'll allow a moment of me
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.460]   bragging on myself, I mean, I think even in 2007,
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.900]   I was throwing some fastballs, right?
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.020]   - Yeah, it's pretty good.
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.180]   - I mean, I remember being frustrated back then
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.220]   because there was a lot of big productivity blogs.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.180]   I felt like I was delivering to goods.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.660]   - That's like good info.
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.500]   - And no one knew it.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.420]   I was just lost in the woods.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.380]   And you know why I think that was?
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.100]   Is because students were my focus.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.340]   That was probably why, because I would be so frustrated.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.340]   I would remember very specifically when lifehacker.com,
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.340]   which was like the big productivity website in 2007,
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.360]   when they would feature someone else's student advice,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.320]   I'd be like, guys, I am killing it in this topic.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.700]   Like I'm throwing 103
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.540]   and you're covering the softball players.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.860]   Come on, I'd be so frustrated.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.260]   Like, don't you know what I'm doing over here?
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.020]   But I think it's because no one cared
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.540]   about student centric advice.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.420]   And so I wasn't really on the radar.
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.040]   So anyways, self-bragging done.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.060]   So let's step back and ask the question,
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.060]   do these ideas about productivity being unrelated from 2007,
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.680]   do they hold up today?
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.140]   Or has my thinking or perhaps the culture
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.420]   surrounding these issues shifted?
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260]   I figured it was worth doing a nuanced update
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.980]   on this old take of mine,
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.280]   because these are still general ideas
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.720]   that people very much care about.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.820]   So this is the deep question I wanna look at today.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.620]   Does Cal still think that productivity is overrated?
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.120]   Now here's our plan of action.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.900]   We will start with a deep dive.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.940]   I'll go, we're gonna revisit this article.
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.160]   We're gonna pick it apart and talk about its relevance today.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.580]   After the deep dive, we're then gonna go into questions.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.140]   I have five questions from you.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.460]   My listeners that are all relevant to this general theme
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.000]   of productivity, is it overrated?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.720]   Productivity versus accomplishment.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.560]   What's the difference?
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.380]   How do they compliment each other?
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.260]   We have five questions that's gonna get into that.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.380]   And then for the final segment,
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.060]   we'll switch to do something interesting.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.020]   A little word of hype for what's to come.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.540]   The interesting thing I've chosen
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.740]   is relevant to this as well.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.040]   So we have full unification today
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.480]   in the episode on this question of,
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.780]   is productivity overrated?
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.540]   All right, so let's deep dive into that.
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.460]   Here's what I thought would be a useful frame
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.220]   for this discussion.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.340]   I went through the article the other day
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.820]   and I pulled out what I thought four of the main ideas were.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.060]   And I wanna go through those one by one
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.060]   and answer the question, is this idea still right in 2023?
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.400]   So again, if you're watching this,
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.940]   episode 235 at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.980]   you'll see I actually have these ideas on the screen
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.380]   and we'll go through them one by one.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.220]   But I'll also obviously say them as well
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.580]   if you're just listening.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.380]   So the first idea I extracted from this article
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.960]   was the notion that productivity equals organization.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.580]   In 2007, I think that was certainly true.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.620]   In common usage, especially online,
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.780]   productivity was most associated with the word advice.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.980]   So if you're talking about productivity,
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.460]   you were typically talking about productivity advice.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.060]   That's what people meant by it.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.620]   And it was advice that was focused on
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.420]   how do you make sense of, keep up with,
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.000]   and prevent yourself from drowning
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.500]   in what seemed to be an increasingly intense deluge
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.980]   of tasks and communication and work.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.100]   I've later written quite a lot about this topic
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.700]   in my last book, "World Without Email"
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.780]   and a lot of my New Yorker writing.
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.940]   I've gone deeper into this.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.180]   What happened, of course,
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.660]   was the front office IT revolution
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.300]   when we brought personal computers
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.020]   to the desk of knowledge workers,
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.660]   when we connected those computers with networks,
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.060]   when we introduced, haphazardly speaking,
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.780]   email and then later tools like Instant Messenger,
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.020]   it created way more work than we were used to before,
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.620]   a faster velocity of work,
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.420]   way more interruptions and context shifting.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.180]   So there was this explosion of interest
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.860]   in the first decade of the 2000s
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.080]   in what do we do about this?
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.740]   And that's what productivity meant.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.500]   And so that comes through very clearly in my article.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.140]   When I'm talking about productivity,
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.500]   I'm talking about productivity advice.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.980]   And when I'm talking about productivity advice,
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.900]   I'm talking about keeping up with and organizing
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.500]   everything that's on your plate.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.420]   In 2023, I think the culture around this term has shifted,
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.180]   especially in online or elite discourses.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.860]   I would say productivity is now much more associated
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.980]   with culture today,
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.360]   whereas in 2007, it was much more associated with advice.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.800]   So when people discuss productivity
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.500]   or refer to productivity today,
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.760]   they're talking more,
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.020]   or they're more likely to be talking about
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.300]   a culture of productivity,
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   a value framework around what produces worth,
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.020]   what defines you as a worthwhile person,
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.780]   what is the meaning of work.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.860]   So it's a much more philosophical, cultural discussion,
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.020]   much less a pragmatic, technical discussion.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.340]   Interestingly, the connection between productivity
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.900]   and accomplishments, like accomplishment in general,
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.320]   is not discussed that much anymore.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.480]   I think it gets in the way of the current
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.400]   in-fashion critiques of productivity.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.880]   So if we wanna think about productivity as a culture
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.280]   or a mood that we can attack
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.600]   or destabilize with criticality,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.160]   we don't wanna really focus too much on,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160]   could this be leading to real accomplishment?
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.380]   Are you doing things that's useful?
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.040]   Because humans are wired for that.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.720]   We still admire people who accomplish things.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.480]   So we've really disconnected discussions of productivity
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.540]   from accomplishment and see it more as a culture
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.260]   that we should discuss or critique.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.160]   So on my checklist here for productivity equals organization
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.900]   I'm gonna give that a red X.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.760]   I don't think that idea still holds up the same in 2023.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.700]   All right, second big idea I extracted
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.540]   from my 2007 article,
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.340]   productivity is unrelated to accomplishment.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.340]   This I think was one of the big ideas
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.180]   from that piece.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.740]   And what I meant, if you'll remember my quotes there,
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.900]   is that you could be organized or not organized.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.360]   It didn't really specify
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.140]   whether you were going to be accomplished,
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.460]   whether you're going to accomplish something noteworthy.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.400]   If you were organized, you might be less stressed,
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.620]   but it wasn't going to,
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.220]   being organized doesn't make you more likely
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.740]   to do a big accomplishment.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.620]   Being disorganized doesn't reduce your probability
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.780]   of having a big accomplish.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.780]   So that was one of the core ideas from my 2007 article.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.220]   But the other related piece here of course,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.300]   is that productivity,
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.140]   at least when seen through this organizational frame,
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.560]   its main role is stress reduction,
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.020]   keep control of things,
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.320]   keep control of the obligations on your plate.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.120]   I would say, yes, that's still true today.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.360]   There is not a very strong correlation
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.560]   between the organizational notion of productivity
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.640]   and significant accomplishment.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.460]   It still remains today, like it did in 2007,
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.320]   that some of the most accomplished people
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.680]   in all sorts of different fields are a mess
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.820]   when it comes to other aspects of their life,
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.700]   their organization, how they keep up with things,
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.900]   how they plan their time.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.400]   So I'm going to give a green check for that idea.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.180]   However, maybe I'll put a little star next to it.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.300]   I have additional thoughts on that.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.580]   So something I missed in 2007,
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.140]   which I think was true that I missed,
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.540]   is what those disorganized professors
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.300]   with the Turing Awards and MacArthur Genius Grants
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.460]   were doing, it wasn't just drive.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.340]   What they were doing is that they were very good
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.360]   at workload management.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.260]   They were very good at saying no,
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.020]   or in the case of these MIT professors,
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.540]   they would implicitly say no by just ignoring the request.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.340]   I write about that in my book, "Deep Work."
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.420]   That was their way of dealing with email
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.180]   in the early 2000s was, I don't want to deal with this.
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.220]   This is a stupid request.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.580]   You didn't specify it clearly enough.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.060]   I'm just going to ignore you, try again.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.460]   And maybe if you write it better
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.660]   or give me more information, then maybe I'll answer.
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.660]   They were very good at workload management.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.420]   I think that's actually relatively universally true.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.780]   People who do really large accomplishments,
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.380]   not people who are reliable at work
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.820]   and get good promotions,
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.860]   the people who do the things that turn heads
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.620]   are very good at workload management.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.020]   The athlete that becomes a superstar is very good
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.680]   at blocking out everything in their life,
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.900]   but practicing that skills.
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.540]   The professors that win the Turing Award are very good
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.260]   at saying no or ignoring the other things coming in
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.860]   so they can work on solving that proof.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.100]   The inventor that invents the light bulb is very good
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.100]   at saying, this is what I'm working on right now.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.860]   All of my resources are going towards
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.460]   trying different filament materials,
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.380]   and no, I'm not going to go speak on your trade commission
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.000]   or something like this.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.980]   Now, I think I missed that in 2007,
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.840]   but it was true then and it's true today,
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.740]   that that is a unifying skill of people
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.580]   who do go on to big accomplishments.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.860]   It's yes, they're disorganized,
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.340]   but they really have their act together
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.180]   when it comes to workload management.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.140]   As a graduate student in 2007,
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.180]   I didn't get that because my life was too easy.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.100]   Here's how it works at a tier one doctoral program
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.780]   like MIT, it's all about research, right?
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.100]   I mean, it's all about producing the best possible work
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.740]   that turns heads in the world of ideas, right?
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.940]   You're here because of your brain, put your brain to use.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:56.820]   It's all about research.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.920]   Because of that, they get out of your way.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.460]   So if you are getting a PhD at MIT in computer science,
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.980]   courses are not at all important.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.020]   You take the courses in your first couple of years,
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.940]   you take, I don't know, six or seven courses,
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.460]   it's not that important.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.660]   You get them out of the way.
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.260]   I think I got A, my memory is I got A's in all my courses,
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.420]   but it didn't really matter.
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.820]   You just couldn't get, I forgot exactly how it worked.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.460]   I guess if you got two B's, it was a problem.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.220]   I don't know, but I think they just gave everyone A's.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.060]   It didn't really matter.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.620]   After those two years, it's like, now do your work,
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.420]   publish something good.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.760]   And so our workloads as grad students
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.540]   was as low as any job anywhere in the world.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.500]   It was basically work on a paper,
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.980]   six months from now, publish it.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.300]   So I don't think it was on my mind.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.880]   Workload management as being a critical component
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.380]   of accomplishment was not on 2007 CAL's mind.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.300]   2023 tenured professor, father CAL, oh my, it's on my mind.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.700]   So I put a little star here
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.300]   for those who are watching online
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.140]   because that idea is right, the one I had in 2007,
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.900]   but it's also, we need to expand it
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.180]   if we really want to capture the full picture here.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.020]   All right, let's go to the third of four ideas
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.140]   from the original article.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.660]   Number three, drive is underrated.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.460]   So this came through in that piece, right?
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.660]   In the quote I read you, I said,
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.640]   here's the thing that really seems to matter.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.080]   This weird, I don't know where it comes from,
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.760]   this weird, mysteriously sourced, tenacious drive
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.960]   of like, I want to do this well,
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.040]   and I'm going to keep shooting basketballs
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.980]   until my hands bleed.
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.320]   Like Jesse, you would like this article.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.140]   I have to find it.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.200]   Someone sent it to the interesting,
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.920]   at calnewport.com address, it was about Steph Curry,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.680]   two of the basketball players.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.500]   And it was saying a big part of understanding his success
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.180]   was he innovated practicing.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.880]   Like he figured out how to not just practice more,
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.280]   but like make his practicing much more focused
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.920]   like a laser on exactly the skills
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.480]   that had the highest value.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.480]   That type of drive, I don't know where that comes from,
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.220]   but every time you see a major accomplishment,
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.800]   that's very important.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.100]   You don't see like, oh, what really mattered for Steph Curry
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:08.100]   was his inbox was clean, and his desk was clear.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.440]   He had a tickler file.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.740]   You better believe his tickler file was reviewed every month
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.500]   and he would move the scraps of papers.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.380]   You know, it doesn't matter.
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.820]   What matters is he's obsessing about,
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.540]   how can I get more out of a four-hour practice session?
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.900]   And I saw that back then, right?
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.700]   I mean, these professors I was around were super focused.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.220]   So I'm going to go ahead and give this one a green check.
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.220]   Drive is underrated because, you know,
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.560]   I don't think we understand it enough.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.700]   What are the different forces that go into it?
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.860]   What are the social forces, what you're around,
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.660]   how you're raised, genetics.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.060]   I have this pet theory that often a major source of drive
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.420]   is there's typically some sort of event that happens
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.180]   that puts a chip on your shoulder in some sense.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.620]   You know, I certainly had this where you're like,
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.460]   I'm going to show them, I'm going to do this.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.500]   Like there's some sort of thing that happens
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   maybe early in life.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.220]   So there's some sort of historical,
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.820]   personal historical event that occurs.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.500]   We don't know enough about it,
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.860]   but it is at the absolute core
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.260]   of people doing really important things.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.140]   And I noticed that back in 2007,
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.080]   why is this person different than that?
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.820]   We don't really know.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.640]   And I think we still don't really know today.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.480]   So it was interesting,
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.780]   like around the time this article came out,
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.660]   this is when Malcolm Gladwell's "Outliers" came out
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.660]   right around this same period.
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.900]   And he was trying to answer that question.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.420]   But I think his question,
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.460]   he answered it more from the perspective
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.140]   of the what than the why.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.220]   So he answered it from the perspective
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.240]   of getting really good in these big accomplishments
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.180]   takes a huge amount of very hard practice.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.560]   And so if you don't have the circumstances
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.900]   to be able to do this practice,
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.980]   you're sort of out of luck.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.460]   The Beatles went to Hamburg
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.500]   and were able to work in these clubs,
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.140]   three or four shows a night,
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.200]   and in this melting pot of different musical styles
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.780]   and really figure out their style.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.020]   And they could deliberate practice hundreds of hours a week
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.700]   and really emerge as a very tight group.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.460]   That's like a classic Gladwellian analysis.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.460]   But what was left out of it was the why.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.620]   Why did they go to Hamburg?
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.980]   Why were they willing to play that much?
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.260]   Why were they so much more driven
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.480]   than all of these other bands
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.020]   that were coming out of Liverpool at the time?
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.780]   And I still don't think we really understand that.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.580]   So I think that's a good point.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.320]   However, I'm going to,
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.660]   I don't know, I'll draw a dotted little arrow
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.380]   for my star from before the disc one,
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.260]   because "Drive" is underrated,
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.820]   but that point we talked about with the last idea,
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.780]   that point we talked about
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.420]   workload management really mattering,
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.760]   that's also relevant here.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.780]   So "Drive" is the secret sauce,
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.860]   but "Drive" coupled with workload management,
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.600]   because all the drive in the world
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.620]   is still going to get your metaphorical car stuck
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.120]   if it's overloaded.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.820]   So I could be super driven,
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.460]   but say yes to too many things
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.020]   and not going to be able to actually live up to my potential.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.500]   So again, there's some sort of weird interchange now
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.180]   that I didn't articulate super well back then.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.380]   Maybe I can articulate it better today,
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.460]   but this weird interplay between "Drive"
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.440]   and developing this ability to say no
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.460]   and manage your workload,
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.980]   and these two things orbit each other,
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.680]   they orbit accomplishment somehow.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.620]   All right, final idea from that 2007 article
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.980]   that I want to point out here is,
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.940]   "Cal is hungry to make a mark."
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.900]   I think that permeated that 2007 article.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.300]   I think that permeated a lot of my writing early on
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.900]   is I was hungry for accomplishment.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:31.060]   I felt potential, I felt I had ability,
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.960]   and I was frustrated that things took time.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.240]   I just wanted, you know, man,
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.460]   and even though exactly what it was,
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.480]   in writing and research,
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.360]   I wasn't quite sure was I gonna start a business,
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.140]   but I just knew I wanted to do something.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.020]   And I think that focus on like,
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.020]   what matters for this accomplishment,
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.820]   you can see it in there.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.820]   Productivity is important
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.180]   because I don't want to be stressed,
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.020]   but man, it's these driven, messy professors
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.380]   who are winning these major awards,
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.140]   that's where it's at, and that's what matters.
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.180]   And that permeates a lot of my writing in 2007,
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.340]   I think it comes through clearly.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:08.340]   I would say 2023 Cal is still hungry, but also tired.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.340]   You know, I mean, this is the difference.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.500]   Now I have a bunch of jobs and a bunch of kids.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.780]   I've done some things,
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.940]   so maybe I don't have that same sense of urgency,
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.540]   but that accomplishment above all else mentality
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.900]   that I had then, I think is not there nearly as much
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.980]   in my writing today, I'm gonna give that a red X.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.340]   Those who follow the show, for example,
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:37.340]   now see the slower philosophy I have about accomplishment
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.180]   that within the craft bucket of the deep life,
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.940]   you should be honing your craft,
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.500]   working on something important,
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.780]   what the Buddha would call right livelihood.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.060]   Do that as much as possible
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.980]   with a good deep to shallow work ratio,
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.420]   that's personally important to me,
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.420]   working on something important with craft,
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.460]   keeping the deep to shallow work ratio really good,
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.180]   I don't react well to large amounts of shallow work,
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.340]   but that is then just one bucket among four.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.140]   So when you're working, that's how you're working,
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.580]   but then you also have community,
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.480]   and then you also have contemplation,
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.260]   then you also have constitution,
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.860]   and this slows things down more,
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.940]   but this is my philosophy of slow productivity, that's okay.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.340]   Because when you look back at the end,
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.780]   what did I do in the last 30 years?
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.740]   You wanna point to some really important things,
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.860]   that's more important that in the scale of this month,
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.100]   am I rock and rolling every single day?
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.060]   So, I mean, I'm still hungry,
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.920]   but I'm not as hungry as 2007 Cal,
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.640]   my philosophies of the deep life and slow productivity,
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.380]   I think have evolved and we're not there,
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.980]   we're not there yet in 2007.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.940]   So that's my look back at that piece,
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.700]   so yes, do I agree today that productivity
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.340]   is still overrated, productivity in the 2007 sense
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.100]   of being organized on top of your work?
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.000]   And I would say, yes, we've changed what we mean
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.900]   by that term over time,
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.240]   but we still end up at the same place,
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.740]   which is the deep life, however you define that,
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.660]   is about much more than just how organized
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.060]   you are in your efforts.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.460]   However, being organized in your efforts
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.140]   makes that life notably less stressful.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.980]   So I think I was onto something back then,
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.020]   even if my ideas have changed.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.340]   - Did you come across any other articles in your research?
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.860]   - Yeah, there's a bunch of interesting ones, yeah.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.780]   I'm thinking I should maybe revisit some more
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.380]   in some future episodes.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.220]   - Yeah.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.200]   - It's interesting to see, it's a real mix.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.080]   My memory was for like at least a year,
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.400]   that blog was straight up student tactics.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.260]   Like here is how you should take notes
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.780]   on a multiple choice exam,
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.000]   here is how you should deal with choosing your courses
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.840]   for a semester.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.380]   And there is a lot of that stuff.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.220]   But what I forgot is I was writing three posts a week.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.060]   - Wow.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:50.980]   - Yeah, because I was hungry, right?
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.500]   And bored because I was like grad students,
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.780]   you know, there's not enough to do.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.040]   It's an easy, easy job.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.140]   So I didn't have much to do because I was a theoretician.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.060]   So I didn't have any labs to go to or experiments to run.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.260]   It just was solve proofs.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.460]   So I was writing three posts a week.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.380]   So yes, every Monday I was writing student advice.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.880]   I called it Monday masterclass.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.380]   I forgot about that.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.900]   I called it Monday masterclass
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.280]   and it was hardcore tactical student advice.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.520]   But then I had Wednesday and Thursday and Friday.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.460]   I think that's the other days I would post.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.060]   And man, I was doing this type of stuff a lot more.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.860]   I was like thinking about accomplishment
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.920]   and productivity and philosophy.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.800]   And it was a more interesting blog back then
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.720]   that I remember.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.560]   - Yeah.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.920]   - Yeah, also just a lot of ideas that are still here today.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.080]   They're just, I've just evolved them,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.160]   but they're still more or less there.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.840]   I don't know, a lot of seeds were being planted back then.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.640]   So basically everything you hear me talk about
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.940]   is like an outgrowth of the first decade, 2000s,
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.100]   like online productivity culture.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.440]   - Your walks along the Charles with your dog.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.160]   - Yeah, well that came later.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.320]   We didn't get the dog until I was a postdoc.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.120]   It's our apartment when I was in grad school
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.400]   didn't allow dogs.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.240]   - Yeah.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.300]   - Yeah, so that came later.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.480]   Anyways, so what we're gonna do then
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.840]   is we'll do five questions that are real people,
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.680]   real listeners with issues around this tension
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.180]   of productivity versus organization.
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.520]   Is productivity overrated?
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.920]   First though, I wanna mention briefly
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.620]   one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.640]   That is our friends at Blinkist.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.880]   Let me tell you what Blinkist is
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.680]   and then I'll tell you why I think you should subscribe.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.240]   So Blinkist is a subscription service
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.120]   that gives you access to short summaries
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.300]   of over 5,500 nonfiction books.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.840]   These short summaries are called Blinks.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.280]   You can either read them or you can listen to them.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.680]   About 15 minutes to read them,
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   about 15 minutes to listen to.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.420]   It gets you the core ideas
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.400]   of all of these important nonfiction books
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.980]   that are coming out ever more each week and each month.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.120]   The reason why they've been a longtime sponsor of the show
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.220]   is because I think reading is critical
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.340]   to living a life of ideas.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.760]   A life of ideas is critical to stand out or succeed
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.860]   in our current knowledge economy.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.240]   There are too many books, however,
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.780]   for you to successfully keep up
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.680]   with which ones you should buy and which ones you shouldn't.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.960]   So you use Blinkist to help you make that determination.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.720]   You come across a book, you say, "That could be interesting."
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.600]   You listen to the Blink, you read the Blink,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.280]   15 minutes later, you have the big idea.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.400]   So now you know, either this is all I need,
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.620]   I can talk about this big idea, I'm not gonna buy the book,
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.600]   or you say, "Wow, I can't wait to buy it."
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.000]   So if you are someone who has books integrated
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.720]   into your life and you absolutely should,
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.760]   Blinkist should be your companion.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.980]   Blinkist is a critical tool
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.540]   for anyone who embraces the reading life.
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.760]   Now they have this nice new feature I wanna mention.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.200]   I think it's called Connect, Blinkist Connect.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.960]   And it allows you to essentially give a Blinkist account
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.980]   to a friend for free.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.060]   It's a two for the price of one promotion
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.720]   that I wanted to mention so that you can share with a friend
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   that you also want to support their reading life.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.580]   So just until February 28th, coming up,
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.600]   just until February 28th,
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.340]   Blinkist has a very special offer for our audience.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.080]   If you go to blinkist.com/deep
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.440]   to start your seven-day free trial,
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.600]   you will get 40% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.680]   So if you're gonna sign up anyways,
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.860]   do it now while that deal is still there.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.040]   That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.720]   blinkist.com/deep to get 40% off and a seven-day free trial,
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.400]   blinkist.com/deep.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.560]   That offer is good only through February 28th.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.780]   And for a limited time,
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.320]   we have that Blinkist Connect promotion as well
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.960]   that allows you to share your premium account.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.560]   So you can get two premium subscriptions
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.100]   for the price of one.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.940]   I also want to mention,
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.940]   these guys have known for a long time, 80,000 hours.
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.980]   Let me tell you what it is,
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.480]   and then I'll tell you why you should check them out.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.040]   80,000 hours, where's that number come from?
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.520]   How many hours you will work in your life.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.600]   40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year,
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.280]   times 40 years gets you to 80,000 hours.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.840]   The idea behind this organization is recognizing
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.100]   that the time you spend working is your biggest resource.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.740]   It's your biggest opportunity
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.360]   to make a difference in the world.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.220]   What career path you follow
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.280]   might be the most important decision you ever make,
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.540]   especially if you care about leaving this world
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.140]   better than how you came before.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.820]   So 80,000 hours is an organization
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.320]   that has spent the last 10 years
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.880]   working alongside academics at Oxford University
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.320]   to conduct research on how to make the most
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.720]   out of your working life.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.160]   They have three different things.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.020]   If you go to 80,000hours.org,
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.520]   there's three different things you can find there.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.200]   One is their website.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.840]   The website has profiles answering,
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.280]   profiles of some of the biggest problems
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.900]   that you can face with your,
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.020]   you can try to help with your career.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.320]   They have career reviews.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.920]   There's even an eight week career planning course.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.280]   Articles on there are really good too.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.000]   There's one I read recently,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.500]   how many lives does a doctor save?
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.600]   They did the math.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.400]   If you become a doctor of a certain type,
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.000]   how many lives will you expect to save
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.200]   throughout your career?
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.960]   They're a kind of quantitative nerdy over there.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   That's why I love them.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.260]   And so you get that type of stuff.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.460]   They also have a podcast that has in-depth conversations
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.740]   with experts on the world's most pressing problems,
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.580]   the 80,000 hours podcast.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.440]   Check out their somewhat recent episode
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.960]   with David Chalmers, the Australian philosopher
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.080]   who's a leading thinker on machine consciousness
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:31.960]   and intelligence.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.560]   I actually just read a lot of David Chalmers
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.600]   for an article I'm writing,
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.020]   and that interview was a useful resource.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.920]   Finally, 80,000 hours offers a job board
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.040]   where they have a curated and constantly updated list
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.200]   of hundreds of active job openings
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.680]   that they think might help you make an impact.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.060]   All right, so I've known these guys for a long time
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.760]   because I was writing about careers
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.040]   and what to do with your careers
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.760]   around the same time they were starting up
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.120]   80,000 hours at Oxford.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.440]   So I've been in touch with these guys.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.200]   We've been talking back and forth for over a decade now.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.800]   So it's really top-notch.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.640]   If you wanna make a difference with your career,
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.720]   you gotta check out 80,000hours.org.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.440]   Now, if you're gonna go over there,
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.160]   go over to 80,000hours.org/deep.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.420]   The slash deep lets you know that you came from here.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.760]   So head over to 80,000hours.org/deep.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.520]   Check out their articles, their podcast, their job board,
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.400]   sign up for their newsletter, 80,000hours.org/deep.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.240]   Find out how you can make all those hours
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   you'll be working your life make a difference in the world.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.600]   All right, the time has come to do some questions
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.080]   sent in from you, my listeners.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.280]   All in this episode will all be about our general question
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.920]   of productivity being overrated.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.080]   Jesse, what do we got as our first question of the episode?
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.760]   - All right, first question's from Andy,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.160]   a 39-year-old IT director.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.880]   "Sometimes it takes me a couple hours
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.480]   "to feel my way into a task
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.160]   "before I start to make some proper progress.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.000]   "At this point, I abandon the rest of my time block schedule
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.240]   "and just go with it.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.420]   "Is this okay?"
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.640]   - Andy, it's a common question.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.520]   Deep endeavors can be hard to start.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.720]   Deep endeavors can get their grips on your mind
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.820]   once they get going and blow up your schedule.
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.960]   I have been there before.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.040]   Anyone else who does deep work on a regular basis
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.800]   has been there as well.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.400]   I have a small and big answer.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.160]   So sort of a small tactical answer
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.340]   and a bigger picture strategic answer to this question.
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.880]   So the small tactical answer is,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.440]   well, let's not make your deep work
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.680]   so hard to get started, right?
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.880]   I noticed that in your question.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.240]   You said you have to feel your way into a task
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.680]   for a couple hours before you start to make proper progress.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.200]   You can make that much smaller.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   That lead up time to you really getting on a roll,
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.360]   you can make that much smaller.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.800]   And I think that's gonna help prevent deep work
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.760]   from blowing up your schedule as consistently.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.120]   I've talked about this a lot on the show.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.520]   You need better rituals.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.880]   So when you do the work and where you do the work,
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.340]   have rituals, consistency.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.640]   These are the times each week I do deep work.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.060]   These are the locations I go to do the deep work.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.460]   I have the location set up in an over the top way.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.940]   All of this is about signaling to your brain,
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.340]   we are shifting modes.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.400]   And once it's learned to trust that signal,
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.620]   it's gonna shift your mode faster
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.840]   than if you're just at your crowded desk,
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.880]   working on email and then just changing nothing else,
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.680]   attempt to wrench your attention away from Slack
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.920]   and over to Microsoft Word and say,
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.440]   I will now write brilliantly.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.240]   That's really hard.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.400]   But if you instead, no, no,
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.920]   I always do first thing in the morning,
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.000]   Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.520]   And I hike through the woods
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.600]   and I go to this outbuilding behind my house
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.840]   and it's a deep work chamber.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.180]   And that's when I do my writing.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.080]   You're gonna get started much faster.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.300]   All right, so rituals will help you get that prefix
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.740]   of wind up time much shorter.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.100]   The big picture answer though,
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.140]   comes back to the theme of today's episode,
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.180]   which is separating productivity
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.780]   in the let me be really organized
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.260]   and make sure I get through things efficiently,
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.100]   definition of the word and accomplishment
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.300]   that you actually care about.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.780]   As we established in the deep dive,
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.900]   these are not the same thing.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.480]   Making steady work on something important
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.840]   so that over time you produce important things
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.700]   that you care about.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.340]   This is basically orthogonal from,
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.460]   I have a time block plan where I'm filling every minute
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.260]   with various things.
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.740]   Once you have that in mind,
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.380]   what you can do is give yourself more breathing room
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.060]   in your schedule.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.420]   So for example, maybe what you do is you say,
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.680]   I don't know, I handle some small things in the morning
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.060]   and then switch over to deep work.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.340]   And it takes what it takes.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.700]   And if I'm done early, I'll go for a walk.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.060]   And if it takes until dinner time,
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.060]   then it takes till dinner time,
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.540]   but I'm not blowing up a schedule.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.100]   Like that would give you plenty of breathing room.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.940]   You wouldn't worry about deep work exploding in time or not.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.860]   It would require that you're doing less
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.880]   because now you are spending less work on shallow work.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.180]   Your schedule has to have a lot more breathing room in it.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.020]   But you know what?
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.720]   A lot of people are in a situation where that would be fine,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.940]   but they're just used to thinking,
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.740]   I have to be productively feeling every minute
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:17.340]   or I'm somehow subverting my chances
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.620]   of actually being accomplished.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.260]   Those are two different things.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.260]   So if you are reducing what's on your plate by 20 to 30%,
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.540]   so that you have much more flexibility on your deep work,
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.400]   I don't think the outside world will even notice.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.700]   I don't think your income's really gonna make a difference.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.380]   But you psychologically will feel a great advantage
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.460]   if you just have breathing room.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.460]   If this takes long, it takes long.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.740]   I'll do this shallow work first,
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.140]   switch over to the deep work, go to my shed
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.780]   so that it doesn't take me two hours to get started.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.820]   And I'll just see what it takes.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.460]   If I'm not feeling it, I'll move the yard.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.340]   If I am, I'll get more work done.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.240]   So we're gonna see this come up,
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.440]   I think, in several answers today.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.540]   Separating highly efficient organization
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.520]   from accomplishment now allows us to play
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.780]   with things like workload.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.540]   Now allows us to imagine a life with accomplishment
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.300]   being something that really impresses us
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.840]   and impresses others and makes us feel fulfilled.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.740]   And separating that from a vision of a life
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.380]   where if I don't get every minute
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.260]   of this time block plan done and every minute dedicated
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.260]   that I'm somehow going to,
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.860]   that there's gonna be a real problem.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.380]   It allows, there's possible to be accomplished
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.740]   without being completely overwhelmed with work.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.420]   So I don't know, Andy, if that's what you're expecting
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.820]   to hear, but do less and give yourself
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.260]   more breathing room for the deep.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.420]   If you can pull that off,
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.620]   that's gonna be the most sustainable answer.
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.820]   All right, what do we got for question number two?
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.340]   All right, next question's from Avi.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.220]   Some weeks I'm very motivated to do work
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.380]   and I feel so good.
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.140]   On others, I just don't feel like it.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.620]   This leads to negative emotions
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.760]   and I completely lose the motivation to do work
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.180]   and indulge in pointless social media.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.300]   Do you have some advice on how I can keep doing
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.460]   the good work every day in slow but steady manner?
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.440]   - Well, this is another prime example
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.180]   of why just focusing on productivity
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.900]   is not in itself a sustainable strategy.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.100]   So if all you're working on is,
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.540]   I'm doing the right organizational things.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.540]   I have my multi-scale plan, I'm time blocking every day,
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.700]   strategic to weekly to daily.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.640]   You could be doing all the things.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.640]   Have all the tools, have all the rules.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.420]   That alone is not gonna make you fulfilled
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.680]   and feel like you're accomplishing things
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.180]   and being excited about work every day.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.300]   And that's what's happening with Avi here.
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.980]   In his extended answer, or his extended version
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:34.820]   of the question, he talked about,
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.700]   hey, I do all your things.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.820]   All your productivity things.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.660]   But he still will just like fall out of like,
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.860]   I don't really wanna work on this
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.020]   and lose whole weeks in the spirals of self-valid
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.700]   as he spends more and more time on social media, et cetera.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.340]   So again, this is the sort of necessary
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.740]   but not sufficient precondition type situation.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.700]   Productivity, these tactics are gonna really be
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.660]   a nice precondition for a sustainable,
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.700]   accomplished deep life,
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.380]   but they're not sufficient on their own.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.300]   So Avi, let's fix, let's try to go forward
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.740]   and fix your problem here.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.420]   I think the issue is either your mind
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.620]   doesn't trust your plan or your mind doesn't like your plan.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.540]   I mean, this is what causes people to just stop working
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.660]   and get lost for three days on social media.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.860]   Either the thing you're working on,
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.420]   your mind says, this is not gonna work.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.420]   We're spending all this time on whatever,
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.780]   like our influencer YouTube channel, and it's not good.
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.020]   We're not gonna become famous
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.100]   and it's not gonna pay our bill.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.200]   Or we're writing this novel or this business ideas.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.100]   I don't even know what this is.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.060]   We're just jumping on calls all the time
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:39.540]   and it's like a simulacrum of business.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.180]   We're not actually like doing something
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.020]   or producing something.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.820]   So your mind might say, I just, this work,
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.260]   I'm not gonna do it.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.340]   This isn't gonna lead us anywhere.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.020]   You know that, you're just spinning your wheels
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.340]   in a highly performative way.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.220]   Or your mind says, okay, maybe this will work.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.540]   I just don't like the plan.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.820]   What we're working on, what this job is,
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.420]   is grinding and boring or against my values.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.900]   I just don't wanna do it.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.060]   So it is your mind against whatever plan
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.760]   your productivity system is saying it should be doing.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.780]   So if we're gonna fix that, there's two things we can do.
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.260]   The first thing we wanna do, of course,
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.580]   is focus on the craft portion,
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:20.320]   the craft bucket and your overall deep life buckets.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.260]   That requires some work here.
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.140]   It requires some work to sort of think through
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.820]   what am I working on and why?
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.280]   What are the projects I'm taking on?
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.500]   What is my workload?
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.060]   Is there something in here I just really hate?
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.700]   How do I re-engineer around that?
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.500]   Is there something in here I think is really important?
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.380]   All right, so how am I gonna do that work?
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.700]   Like, let's start thinking that through.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.300]   Let's not be so haphazard
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.740]   and just see if we're in the mood for it
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.560]   and what our mind says.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.300]   Let's take that a little bit out of the picture
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.020]   like we talked about with Andy in the first question.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.820]   Maybe we'll set up a location for this work
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.300]   and it's different than what we do that.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.700]   Maybe my workload is out of whack.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.240]   I need to take things off of my plate.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.180]   Maybe I need to more radically shift what I'm doing,
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.620]   but we wanna get the craft bucket in order.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.020]   So you gotta know what you're working on,
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.740]   why you're working on, how you're working on it.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.860]   You want all of those pieces to come together.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.700]   And that might take you about six weeks
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.100]   of really thinking and tinkering
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.260]   and trying to optimize that part of your life.
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.980]   The second key then, maybe a little bit more surprising,
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.940]   is looking at the other buckets of your life
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.780]   after that as well,
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.500]   the other areas that make a deep life deep
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.840]   and start systematically getting your house in order
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.700]   in each of those other areas as well.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.780]   Constitution, your health, community,
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.780]   how you're serving or leading on behalf of others
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.980]   that are important to you.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.380]   Contemplation, how you're making ethical, philosophical,
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.560]   and theological concerns,
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.220]   something that you're engaged with and at the core
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.540]   about how you structure and live your life.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.580]   You get these houses in order,
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:44.120]   and even then when you're in a hard part
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.160]   or a hard phase in work,
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.540]   you're much less likely to fall into,
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.040]   let's go on YouTube all day.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.380]   Let's go on TikTok all day.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.540]   That spiral of activity, the self-recrimination
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.580]   that comes out of the spiral of self-recrimination
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.220]   that comes out of you falling deeper into activities
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.140]   that you know are ultimately shallow
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.700]   and not useful to you or your vision on earth.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.940]   When you have the other buckets tuned up,
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:10.060]   even when work is hard, they're gonna support you.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.220]   Even when, okay, I have this whatever,
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.860]   I'm in year four of med school, my residency,
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.380]   and I think this is important,
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.460]   but it's just so hard and it's exhausting,
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.940]   they support you.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.000]   And you say, I wanna lead other people.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.080]   I wanna be, I'm exercising, I'm outside,
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.340]   I have the celebration bucket, I have this hobby,
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.380]   I'm really into film, or I have these other things
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.820]   that are more meaningful and quality,
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.220]   and they're there to fill my time.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.380]   And even if I have to take a break from work for a few days,
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.020]   what I'm going into is something else that's important,
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.540]   something else that I think is useful.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.620]   So these are the two aspects
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.820]   of what's pushing to the spiral.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.620]   One is that your relationship to work itself
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.820]   needs some work, the craft bucket has to be overhauled.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.140]   But the second piece is you don't have other options
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.840]   for when work is getting you down.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.620]   So it's, I'm being pushed towards, I need a break,
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.540]   and I have nothing else quality to do with that break.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:07.540]   So I end up on TikTok looking at ASMR videos,
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:12.220]   which I think is what people do on TikTok.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.900]   So those are your two options, okay?
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.040]   So you gotta get the whole deep life in order,
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.340]   and it's not gonna get rid of hard things,
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.020]   it's not gonna make your job feel good every day,
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.280]   it's not gonna solve all your problems,
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.060]   but I think that's what's gonna be your best bet
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.580]   for getting out of this cycle of self-doubt
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.060]   and self-recrimination.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:33.580]   All right, Andy and Avi, oh, look at this.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.940]   So what we need now is someone whose name starts with a B,
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.460]   it's exactly what we have.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.420]   - Ben. - Yes.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.700]   - 24 year old software engineer.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.500]   - I alphabetize all of my questions now.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.220]   I think that's very important.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.060]   I think people have high expectations.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.700]   All right, what we got from Ben here?
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.780]   - All right, as a sophomore developer,
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.580]   I sometimes have to wait up to 30 minutes
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.580]   to merge a new bug fix or feature
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.900]   into the main branch of a program.
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.940]   These durations are unpredictable.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.980]   What should I do to be productive in this time?
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.080]   - Ben, you have to figure out
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.780]   in these 10 to 30 minute breaks
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.180]   how you can both be exercising, reading,
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.660]   and cleaning out your inbox at the same time,
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.480]   because not a single moment can be wasted.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.060]   Now, I picked this question because again,
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.340]   I think it gets to the distinction
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.580]   between productivity and accomplishment.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.060]   It's good to be organized to take stress off your plate,
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.340]   but that doesn't mean that you need to deploy
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.980]   those skills of organization to fill every minute with work.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.340]   So one solution here, Ben, is to just chill.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.220]   And this is nice.
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.040]   Like there's periods during my day
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.740]   where I submit a merge of my program branch
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.860]   and I have to wait for my manager to approve it.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.660]   And I'm just gonna like go see what people are up to,
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.220]   you know, or kick back a little bit.
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.100]   It's nice outside.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.620]   I'm gonna go sit outside and go for a walk
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.540]   while I wait to hear back from them.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.900]   Like, I don't know, I don't have to have something planned.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.220]   And this is something I both appreciate
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.620]   and have to work on.
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.140]   Because I do too many roles in my life,
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.580]   in my professional life I have too many roles,
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.260]   and especially since I have my nine to five job,
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.820]   you know, my nine to five framework where I work nine to five
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.740]   so like my work has to fit in there.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.500]   I often enter these areas or these spans
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.140]   where I have to use every minute of the time
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.380]   because, you know, three different jobs need things.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:18.840]   And because I have these 2007 style productivity skills,
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.380]   I can do that.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.940]   I can control everything and interleave
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:22.900]   and make it all work.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.860]   But I don't wanna do that all the time.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.380]   And this is the situation, Ben,
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.940]   is you should have the ability to do that, sure,
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:30.780]   but don't do it all the time.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.940]   And what I constantly seek and when I'm happiest
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.380]   is when I'm not in those modes.
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.380]   And what my productivity skills then gain me
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:39.420]   is that like I'm working four hours out of the day
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.880]   and I can end early and go do something else.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.840]   Go hang out with my kids or prepare a project for them
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.400]   for when they get home from school.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.900]   So this again, gets to this core distinction
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.620]   between productivity and accomplishment.
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.180]   You can be a very good programmer and produce great code
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.160]   and be respected for it and hone your craft
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.100]   and take breaks when you're waiting for, you know,
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.340]   compiles or features to be merged in.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.140]   And so I might suggest that, Ben.
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.060]   Like don't overplan that time.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.260]   Just like see what you're in the mood for.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.420]   Maybe you just need to like rest
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.780]   or you're reading something
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.460]   or you're doing something that's vitally important.
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.940]   Like trying to follow up on the last minute
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.740]   minor league signings with invites to spring training camp
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.620]   that the nationals are doing.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.820]   Like that's the type of thing
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:24.180]   you should probably be spending those breaks doing.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.740]   But you don't have to necessarily fill every minute
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.060]   of that time with what could I do that's productive?
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.300]   So I'm using you as an example, Ben,
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.820]   to try to make that distinction.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.460]   You can be honing your craft
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.580]   and doing things that are important
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.700]   and enjoy your accomplishments.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.420]   You can be organized and you can be productive.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.320]   All of that can be true
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.420]   and you don't have to be filling every minute with work.
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:45.620]   And Jesse, when I, because you know,
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.900]   these systems are useful.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.180]   I'm good at them 'cause I invented a lot of them.
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.420]   I can squeeze a lot into a day.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.860]   But it's exhausting.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.700]   It's not a sustainable way to live.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.420]   I mean, it's this weird balance.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:01.020]   If you don't have these 2007 style productivity skills,
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.780]   it's really stressful if you have anything
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.500]   but like the easiest job.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.700]   It's just, ugh, right?
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.540]   I'm behind, I'm stressed.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:09.940]   There's this meeting and I'm staying up late
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.860]   because I didn't even remember this until it's seven
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.260]   and it's due at seven the next morning.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.360]   Like it's no fun, no fun.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.980]   When you have these skills, you can avoid that.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.940]   But it's this temptation that once you have them
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:23.100]   is like, I could get another thing interleaved here.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:23.940]   - You get another job.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.260]   - I could add this project, get another job.
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.340]   Why not one more job?
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.740]   You know, because you can do it.
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.860]   It's possible, but you don't want
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.180]   to necessarily unlock that power.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.860]   So that's the way I, I'm getting better at that, I think.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.500]   But this is what I'm trying to gain towards
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.740]   is I've over-provisioned my productivity toolkit.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:47.120]   So when I get into temporary moments of overload,
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.400]   I can handle it, but the steady state,
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.840]   I have more time than I know what to do with.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.940]   To me, that's the sweet spot.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.180]   So we'll see.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.940]   - You pick up your books, that's when you read your books.
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.940]   - I do read a lot of books, yeah.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.380]   I just finished a monster, 450 pages
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.920]   on the history of the NFL.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.760]   - Really?
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.900]   - Yeah, for my sports book group.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.800]   - Wow.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.560]   - Yeah, I know a lot about the NFL now.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.800]   - A lot of Lombardi in there.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.160]   - A lot of Lombardi, yeah.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.160]   Lombardi, yeah, I'm not, you know what?
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.060]   I was just about to start going on a long tangent
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:19.320]   about the '60s and the NFL and the low-hanging fruit
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.960]   of these major innovations in the sport
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.220]   that were all still happening.
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.620]   So there was this period where if you were Paul Brown
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.560]   or Vince Lombardi, even as late as maybe Walsh in the '90s,
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.420]   there are still areas where you could figure out
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.480]   something new and your team would win for four years
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.120]   before like the rest of the league caught up
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.000]   and figured out how to do those same things.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.160]   But I'm not gonna go down that road.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.480]   I could, but I'm not, I choose not to.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.040]   Just like I could add another job, but I don't
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.200]   'cause I recognize the power.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.040]   All right, let's keep going.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:47.860]   What do we got here?
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:48.960]   - And this episode's gonna come out
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.540]   right after the Super Bowl.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.600]   - Yes, yes, we should edit in,
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.280]   like they did in the Simpsons,
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.720]   Cruddy Sunday was the name of the season 11 episode
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.080]   where they go to the Super Bowl.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.960]   But they obviously have to film,
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.480]   do the animation before the Super Bowl,
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.400]   even though it aired after it.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.280]   So they just edited in the names of the teams.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.480]   So I think we could do that.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.680]   - Yeah, we'll show you a bet slip.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.000]   - Yeah, Jesse, that was a very good game
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.640]   by the Philadelphia Eagles.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.040]   I really appreciated how they won by a score of 21-7.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:28.400]   I felt bad that Mahomes had to leave the field
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.360]   when his ankle broke off.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.960]   - All right, enough nonsense.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.040]   All right, next question from Michael,
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.720]   a 32-year-old marketer.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.720]   I run my own business.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.880]   Sometimes I can let deep work take center stage,
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.960]   which I love.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.340]   Other weeks, the most important thing requires
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.960]   that I sift through dozens of websites
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.780]   and send dozens of emails.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.760]   This leaves me feeling frustrated.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.960]   Now that I've learned to love deep work,
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.600]   how do I survive the shallow work?
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.280]   - So Michael, I'm gonna give you a more exaggerated version
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.680]   of the answer I gave to the original question
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.720]   we tackled in this segment.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.520]   Because you're self-employed,
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.960]   you have flexibility here.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.920]   Let's take advantage of it.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.360]   What I'm gonna suggest is consider this schedule.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.520]   Deep work every morning until lunchtime,
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.500]   followed by like an hour of core, like email,
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.400]   just keep the lights on business work.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.320]   On weeks where you have larger, shallow projects
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.400]   demanding your time, like you talked about in your question,
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.960]   where like I have to like send a dozen email
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.680]   and I have to go to a dozen websites,
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.880]   then you can do that work in the afternoons.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   Weeks where you don't have that,
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.320]   then you can go to the movies.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.640]   Now to make this possible,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.320]   you're gonna have to reduce to some degree,
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.400]   not as much as you might think,
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.720]   but you might have to reduce to some degree
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.140]   the amount of work, the number of projects on your plate.
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.760]   But if you're doing deep work every day,
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.400]   every week until lunchtime,
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.200]   you're gonna be able to produce a lot of really good stuff.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.800]   And then some weeks you have necessary,
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.240]   shallow, rich projects you have to work as well.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.320]   Working every afternoon on that,
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   you can be on point, use some of my organizational skills
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.160]   so that you're being pretty effective in those times.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160]   That'll work as well.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.280]   So I'm thinking maybe like a 20% reduction
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.320]   in the projects on your plate
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.240]   would make that schedule possible.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.160]   That is a schedule in which you are never gonna be
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.520]   so frustrated or disappointed
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.400]   because you're always doing deep work.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.760]   Also, it's gonna be a schedule
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.460]   where it's gonna be sustainable and quite enjoyable
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.920]   because you will often have weeks
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   where you're whatever, going to the movies.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.200]   I did my deep work, checked in on my email, it's two.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.840]   I don't have a big shallow project going on right now.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.120]   I'm gonna go, you know, train for my triathlon.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.000]   I'm gonna go work in my woodshed.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.900]   I'm gonna go watch a movie or whatever.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:38.920]   That's actually, I think,
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.660]   a really enjoyable, sustainable lifestyle.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:45.400]   It sounds shocking when you first say something like that,
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.280]   but I bet, Michael, if you did that right,
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.760]   the difference in your income as a business would be minor.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.960]   Like an amount of money that you would pay
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.520]   to be able to have a schedule like that.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.560]   But again, this comes back to
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.000]   what's really holding us back there
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.040]   is probably not a fear
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.040]   that your company is gonna go out of business.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.520]   It is, like we've been talking about,
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.280]   this intermingling between productivity and accomplishment.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.980]   This idea that if I have the ability with productivity tools
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.660]   to fill every minute of my day, and I'm not doing that,
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.320]   then I'm diminishing my accomplishment.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.000]   So that's the trade-off I'm making.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.120]   When we recognize they're relatively orthogonal,
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.200]   hey, if you do deep work every morning most weeks,
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.880]   you're gonna do really good projects
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:27.920]   and build stuff you're proud of.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.280]   Your business is gonna be fine.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.120]   That's what matters.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.280]   Oh, and then, you know, for the other stuff
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.120]   do it in the afternoons
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.320]   and some weeks will be busier than others,
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.560]   but have a workload such that that's always enough time.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.000]   So you have to cancel a couple of projects,
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.600]   cancel a couple of projects.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.080]   That is completely a reasonable approach
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.600]   if you believe that my accomplishment requires this,
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.420]   my productivity can serve that.
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.480]   So that's what I think, Mike.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.680]   I think you should try something like that.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.640]   It could be a different schedule,
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.880]   but I think you should try something like that
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.320]   where you're never far away from deep work
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.000]   and your shallow demands,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.320]   your provision so that like the worst shallow demands
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.600]   you can handle in a schedule that still has deep work,
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.440]   and on the good days,
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.680]   your schedule is something that like,
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.920]   you won't even tell people about
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:07.260]   because they'll be too jealous that three days in a row,
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:11.200]   you were able to just kick back and do something else.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.480]   So give that a try.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.680]   All right, let's do one more.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.520]   - All right, sounds good.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.440]   Next question's from Marie.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.880]   How do you balance the desire to optimize systems
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.240]   and maximize productivity
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.500]   with the value of making genuine human connections?
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.720]   - Yeah, again, this comes back to the same theme.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.680]   That's why I put this in here.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.560]   When I'm in super time block mode,
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.320]   because all three of my jobs are humming at the same time,
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.960]   it does hurt human connection.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.160]   I'm not on text threads.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.840]   I'm not, I don't know what my family's texting about.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.200]   I might not see email for a couple of days,
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.140]   on the inboxes that aren't directly related
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.860]   to what I'm working on.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.920]   I'm not having sort of long phone calls
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:55.800]   with people I know.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.240]   I become sort of hard to reach.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.600]   And that is a reality of very productive days.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.200]   We can put quotation marks around productive,
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.800]   but if you're gonna use my techniques to their full extent
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.560]   and time block every minute of your day,
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.860]   you're not gonna be chiming in on casual text threads.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.500]   In fact, I form an antagonistic relationship
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.340]   with text messaging, non-professional text messaging
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.020]   during my busy periods,
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.680]   because I'll just see out of the corner of my eyes,
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.760]   like various people are,
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.600]   hey, what about this and texting me things?
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.200]   And I'm thinking, A, I can't deal with this right now.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.480]   I'm in the middle of a 30 minute block
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.360]   and I know what it needs to be.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.120]   But B, now you put something in my head
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.320]   that I have to remember.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.080]   Now there's an open loop and I'm almost be antagonistic,
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.560]   which is not the relationship you want
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.640]   with your family and friends.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:42.300]   So what you're pointing out here, Marie, I think is true.
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:46.280]   And I think the solution to it is to work less.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.880]   So don't be in those super tightly timed,
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.880]   super tightly time block days all the time.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.000]   That have a steady state, a sort of normal state
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.800]   where you have breathing room in your schedule.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.240]   And you can actually put aside time.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.680]   I'm gonna take a whole hour for lunch
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.880]   and I might call someone and check in on some text messages.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.320]   I will unsolicited just send someone something,
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.300]   a friend of mine, like, hey, I read this
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:07.400]   and I thought about you.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:12.400]   Have the breathing room to actually proactively service
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.160]   your social connections.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.080]   I think that's the right way to do it.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.300]   The other thing that people do,
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.800]   which I think works just as bad
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.840]   as always having every minute time block, by the way,
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:27.000]   is saying, well, because I don't want to ignore people,
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.200]   because I want to be friendly,
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.340]   what I'll do is just do my work bad all the time.
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.680]   So I'll just always sort of have this here.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.480]   And if anyone texts, I will stop whatever I'm doing,
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.440]   I'll answer that text.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.080]   And I'll just sort of always be involved
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.320]   in back and forth throughout the day.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.800]   I think a lot of people fall back on that default.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.420]   They don't want to ignore people.
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.440]   And so that's what I'm gonna do.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.880]   But then all your work is bad.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.200]   You're constantly context shifting
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.080]   and you're reducing your ability throughout the entire day.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.800]   So that's why I think the right middle ground here
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.940]   is I will schedule time.
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.400]   I have enough breathing room in my schedule
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.680]   that I can schedule time to check in
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.600]   on these other things in my life that are important to me.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.000]   And when I'm doing that, I'm gonna do that.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.200]   I'm gonna do it well.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.880]   And when I'm not doing that, I'm doing something else.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.800]   I'm not gonna mix them.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:09.600]   So we don't want to completely mix work with socializing.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.740]   We don't completely want work to push socializing
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:13.200]   out of the way all the time.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.960]   So what we want to do is have a reasonable enough
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.540]   work schedule that there is time in it
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:23.320]   dedicated to social activity.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.620]   Now you couple that with a clear schedule shutdown,
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.720]   complete rituals that when you're not working,
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:28.560]   you're not working.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.720]   And of course you are open to people
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.360]   and you can be incredibly social.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:33.600]   I mean, the one thing,
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.800]   I don't know if this is where Marie is trying to get.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.120]   A lot of people try to get there with me where they say,
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.240]   I just want you to end up in a place where the answer
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.920]   is just, it's fine that I'm on my text all day.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.640]   And I'm not gonna end up there.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.980]   What's the point of having a job
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.040]   if you're just gonna do it poorly?
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.520]   Like you're putting yourself in a cognitive state
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.320]   that makes it very difficult to do whatever you do.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.160]   So that's what I think we should be aiming for
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.640]   is when you're working, you're working.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.840]   So put breaks during your work
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.640]   to actually connect to other people.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.720]   That's the sweet spot.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:00.680]   I gotta do more of that.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.240]   I mean, Jesse, when I'm time blocked up to the hilt,
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.760]   I'm just off the radar.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.560]   I am off the radar.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.860]   You know, people are saying, you've seen this.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.840]   Like if I'm in a reasonable day,
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.440]   I'll answer your text messages.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.280]   And if I'm not, you're just not gonna hear from me.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.120]   - Yeah.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.280]   - And it's not like I'm looking at my phone and saying,
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.200]   forget you, Jesse.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.240]   It's like, I haven't seen my phone in three hours.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.080]   - Yeah.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.320]   - I'm just like, I'm, you know, rock, rock, rock,
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.160]   rock and rolling.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.720]   You don't wanna live that way all the time.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.960]   I feel like that's the theme that's emerging
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.560]   from these questions is,
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.640]   you need to know how to organize yourself.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.400]   It's stressful if you're not.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.280]   You can still be very accomplished if you're disorganized,
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.060]   but why have the stress?
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:41.020]   But don't take those skills for granted.
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:42.520]   Don't push them to an extreme.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.920]   Don't use them to fill every minute,
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.600]   every minute of your day constantly working.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.280]   Because if you always are in that state,
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.520]   it's unsustainable and it creates
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.840]   all these other negative externalities.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.920]   I feel like all of my answers today have been about
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.640]   finding this smart balance.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.400]   How do I deploy these skills,
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.600]   but still have intention about what I want my day
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.160]   to be like.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.420]   - Back in 2007, when you wrote that article
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.760]   and you were talking about the drive,
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.120]   did you think about money a lot?
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:10.960]   Was that a factor?
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:14.200]   - No, because I had gone to grad school
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.880]   instead of industry.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.280]   So psychologically, I'd already walked away from money.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.800]   So I had a job offer on the table from Microsoft,
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.080]   which back then, so that was in 2004 when I had that offer.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.840]   So this was Google wasn't a thing yet.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.000]   Facebook wasn't a thing yet.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.120]   Microsoft was the, Amazon was small.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.160]   So I had this big offer from Microsoft.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.140]   They're gonna send me to business school.
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:37.140]   It was, what was his name?
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.120]   Not Bill Gates, but--
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:39.960]   - Ballmer?
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.360]   - Ballmer had this pet program where he's like,
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.760]   we're gonna hire engineers and we're gonna send them
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.360]   to graduate school at Northeastern,
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.400]   or Northwestern at Kellogg.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.680]   And we're gonna send them to graduate school.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.280]   It's easier to train talented engineers to be businessmen
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.360]   than it is to train business people to be engineers.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.000]   And we're gonna send them for free to business school
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.560]   to be project managers.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.240]   And there was this whole program.
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:06.800]   And I remember for the time, it felt like a lot of money.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.840]   And then I was, I'm gonna go to grad school instead.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.900]   So I'd already made that decision.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.920]   So psychologically, money was not on the table.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.960]   So what was on the table, why you go to grad school,
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.000]   what's on the table if you're at a school like MIT
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.800]   is citations, impact, publications.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.080]   That was what accomplishments was.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.740]   Was you produced, and this is why I'm so obsessed
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.080]   about ideas, 'cause this was the entire atmosphere
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:28.920]   I was in.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:32.340]   You produce an idea that was influential, it was smart.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.480]   Everyone's citing it.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.120]   Everyone's using that to do their own work.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.880]   You wrote this book that everyone's reading.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.980]   It was all an ideas economy.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.560]   And everyone just sort of had enough money.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.780]   Like, I don't know, I'm a professor, I'm bad with money,
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:47.880]   but I have, I live, I haven't thought much about it.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.280]   I live in Boston, it's fine.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.480]   It was like, everyone had enough money.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.200]   No one really cared about money.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.620]   It was all an idea economy.
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.260]   And everyone wanted to be rich at that economy.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.680]   So all that stuff is so influential
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.520]   to the way I think about things now.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.400]   Interesting times.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.080]   All right, so I wanna switch over to something interesting.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.520]   Before I do, I wanna mention another one of our sponsors,
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.800]   our friends at Henson Shaving.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.920]   That's a true story, Jesse, on my way over here today.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:19.380]   A lot of traffic, I was waiting to cross the road
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:23.060]   as someone from across the street caught my eye,
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:26.820]   busy street, Carroll Avenue in Tacoma Park.
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:31.820]   And they pushed a family out of their way
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:35.560]   into the traffic and the cars were all screeching
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.540]   and piling up as they sprinted past the opening that made,
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.140]   that corridor that made the cross the street
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:43.620]   as this family was on the ground
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.320]   and the cars were crashing into each other.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.720]   So they could make it across the street and say,
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:50.060]   I really like your shave.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.780]   That shave looks really good.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:54.340]   And you know who gave me that shave
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:57.860]   was my Henson Shaving experience.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.220]   Henson, I talk about them all the time now.
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.340]   It is the razor that I use
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:08.340]   because it is not a plastic thing that you throw away
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.340]   you know, every week.
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.260]   It's not one of these things you get
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.060]   behind all the security things at the pharmacy
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.940]   or have mailed to you every week in a box.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:21.300]   Instead it's this beautifully engineered piece of aluminum,
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:26.140]   precisely manufactured, beautiful old school capital T tool.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:31.140]   And then you take a standard 10 cent safety razor,
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:32.260]   little razor blade,
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.980]   and you put it onto this piece of aluminum
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.380]   and it screws into place.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.460]   And it's so precisely engineered
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:42.460]   that you only have 0.0013 inches of the razor blade
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:46.320]   extending past the aluminum beveled edge of the razor.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.140]   That allows you to get a very close shave
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:51.420]   without the diving board effect.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:52.840]   If you have too much blade sticking out,
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.900]   you get a diving board effect.
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.140]   So with one 10 cent razor,
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.900]   which you use this beautiful,
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.620]   beautifully engineered aluminum razor,
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.900]   you get a great shave that you would otherwise need
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.300]   with one of those plastic subscription bands.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.220]   And I might be exaggerating,
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.620]   but I think they have 17 blades in them now.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.460]   It's how it works.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:16.340]   So if you wanna get a good shave with a cheaper made razor,
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.740]   you just have to throw a lot of blades at it.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.020]   And I think now the subscription service,
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.380]   it's a wall of blades that you just,
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.540]   you have to kind of slide down the wall of blades.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:31.540]   With a Henson's, one 10 cent safety razor blade
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.460]   put into this beautifully engineered piece
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.480]   of aluminum razor,
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.420]   you get a shave that can literally cause traffic pileups.
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:39.260]   So I love them.
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.080]   I use them.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.580]   It is what I use every day.
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.120]   It makes me enjoy my shaving experience.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.560]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.540]   and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:52.180]   Visit hensonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you,
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.920]   and then use that code CAL when you check out
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.780]   to get two years worth of blades free with your razor.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.780]   So all you gotta do is just make sure
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.740]   you add the two years of blades to your cart,
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:05.480]   and then type in CAL as the promo code when you check out,
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.080]   and the price for the blades will go down to zero.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:14.080]   So that's 100 free blades when you head to hensonshaving.com/cal
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:20.180]   and use that code CAL.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:25.240]   And I also wanna talk about stamps.com.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:30.240]   The post office, as I pointed out, in Tacoma Park,
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.240]   is right down the street from our HQ.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.660]   So I often see the lines of people building up there.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.600]   I don't wanna spend my time waiting
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.060]   in line at the post office.
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.680]   You probably don't either.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.880]   This is where stamps.com enters the pictures.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.540]   For 25 years, stamps.com has been indispensable
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.080]   for over 1 million businesses.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.340]   It gives you access to USPS and UPS shipping services
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:58.340]   that you need right from your computer.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:03.300]   Anytime, day or night, no lines, no traffic, no waiting.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.160]   You print your postage, you stick it on,
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.140]   you schedule a pickup, and you are done.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:12.160]   So especially if you run any sort of small business
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.720]   that requires a non-trivial amount of shipping things
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.760]   or sending things through the mail,
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.200]   you need a stamps.com subscription.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.740]   So you should set your business up for success
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.880]   when you get started with stamps.com today.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.680]   When you sign up, use that promo code DEEP
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.500]   for a special offer that includes a four-week trial
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.300]   plus free postage and a free digital scale.
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.460]   No long-term commitments or contracts required.
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:35.400]   So you go to stamps.com,
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.520]   click the microphone at the top of the page,
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.960]   enter the code DEEP to get that special offer.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.720]   Stamps.com.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.020]   All right, so to wrap up the show,
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.500]   I like to pull at least one thing interesting
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.120]   that listeners have sent to Jesse and I
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.660]   at the interesting@calnewport.com email address.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.920]   This is where people send me things
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.680]   they think I might be interested about
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.560]   from the world of the internet.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.420]   And I like to feature some of these on the show.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.580]   So today, I'm gonna switch over to it now.
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.360]   Today I chose something someone sent me just the other day
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.460]   that was really relevant actually to our conversation.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.820]   So I thought it would be good to focus on.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:19.300]   So this is a, it was a article, I suppose.
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.660]   Let me see if they say where this is from.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.500]   I have it on the screen now.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.500]   So if you're watching again, episode 235,
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.920]   if you're watching on YouTube, Cal Newport Media,
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.480]   it's from a magazine called Change.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.920]   It's from their January, February, 2023 issue.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:37.840]   The title of the article is "The Productivity Trap,
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.520]   Why We Need a New Model of Faculty Writing Support."
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.600]   So I won't read the whole article,
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.720]   but there's a nice abstract.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.560]   So we can go over a couple of points from the abstract here
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.020]   because I think it's interesting and it gets to,
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.440]   gets exactly to the point of our episode today
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.800]   about thinking about the complicated relationship
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.220]   between productivity and meaningful accomplishment.
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:04.220]   So here's a couple bits of summary from this article.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.960]   One, productivity is so entrenched in our visions
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.740]   of good work and a successful academic career
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:13.740]   that has become normalized and thus very hard to question.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.860]   Valorizing exceptional productivity
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:17.940]   normalizes escalating standards.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.740]   It is hard to know how much is enough,
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.160]   especially when more always seems better.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.520]   The myopic focus on productivity feeds the illusion
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.980]   that we can and should live up to its demands.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.600]   So let's just stop there for now.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.980]   This is an interesting critique of academia,
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.580]   which at least based on my experience of computer science,
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.500]   that's my field, so I don't wanna speak for other fields,
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.700]   but at least based for my field,
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.240]   there is a lot of truth to this.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.600]   There is a notion of productivity that has taken hold
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.640]   a long time ago in my particular field
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.940]   that's based on quantity.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.320]   How many papers have you published?
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.120]   Papers in top venues.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.740]   What I learned coming up is more is better than less,
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.920]   and I got really good at that.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.420]   I was trained to do that.
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:07.420]   How do you publish five plus papers a year in good venues?
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.200]   And when I got to Georgetown,
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:12.040]   I had been trained up right at MIT,
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.200]   and I could fire up that engine,
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.440]   and because I was very organized,
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.440]   I could find a way to do it
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.760]   that it wasn't gonna completely dominate all my time,
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.360]   and I could go up and get tenure early.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.720]   But it does feel like a trap
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.160]   because if five, why not six?
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.120]   If six, why not seven?
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.520]   It really does push you towards quantity.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:32.360]   And everyone you talk to in my field would say,
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.760]   that doesn't seem that important.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.720]   It's kinda crazy that this is what we have to fixate on.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.840]   So what would be the alternative?
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.080]   Well, in computer science, the alternative is quality.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.840]   Have you produced something that's important
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.160]   that's really changed the field?
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.900]   Like that's actually, literally speaking,
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:45.800]   what's gonna matter.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.420]   I produced a new idea.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.840]   It took me a long time, but I produced a new idea
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.440]   that changed the way we solve things,
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.720]   it increased our understanding in a non-trivial way.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.800]   It's hard to have those breakthrough ideas
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.440]   when you're publishing five papers, six papers,
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.980]   seven papers a year.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.560]   So I think this point here is interesting.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.060]   Now, what do we do about it?
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.360]   Well, in computer science,
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.000]   there was an interesting proposal.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.480]   So there's a trade group called CRA,
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:15.380]   and they had a, I guess it was a task force
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.540]   to look into this question,
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.240]   and they came back with a recommendation,
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.200]   which I thought was simple, but brilliant.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.480]   And they said, here's what we should do.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:26.400]   We should say, when you are being hired for an academic job,
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.960]   you send us your three best papers
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.160]   you published as a grad student.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.840]   And that's all we'll look at.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.120]   How good are your three best papers?
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.700]   I don't care if you publish 50 others,
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.800]   how good are your three best papers?
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.860]   And when you later, so you get hired, go up for tenure,
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.600]   you send us five papers.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.560]   These are the five papers I think are my best work.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.200]   And we say, how good are these papers?
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.800]   What is the, what's your highest quality work?
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.120]   How quality was it?
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.000]   And everyone who hears this idea says, that would be great.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.940]   If I could spend two years trying to make an idea right,
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.360]   I would not feel like I was on this treadmill.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.800]   I would produce much more important work.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.560]   I think my accomplishments in the long run
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.280]   would be more meaningful.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.720]   But it's very difficult to shift over to a model like that
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.320]   because everyone has to shift over together
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.780]   or it doesn't work.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.360]   How do you get tenure, for example?
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.400]   It all comes down to, for the most part,
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:17.000]   letters from other academics in your particular field
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:17.960]   from around the world.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.400]   And they look at your resume,
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.640]   they look at your publications,
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.320]   they should know you at this point.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.160]   And they write letters
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.360]   for the university rank and tenure committee that says,
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.860]   here's how we think about this person.
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:29.380]   What is their reputation in the field?
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.480]   How good are they?
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.760]   Not a bad way to do it, right?
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.000]   Let's just get people who know the field to say,
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.460]   is this a serious researcher?
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:36.880]   Let's get rid of the games.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.300]   What's their reputation?
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:41.000]   The problem is, if everyone else out there
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.960]   is still thinking about quantity as being the main metric,
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.800]   when those letters come back in,
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.440]   if your institution says, oh no,
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.200]   we just care about your three best papers,
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.480]   and that's all we sent out,
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.720]   those letters are still judging you
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.000]   on whatever the cultural convention is.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.800]   Which is, Cal only published seven papers
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.440]   since he's been an assistant professor.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.040]   Like, that's not great.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.800]   So if we can't switch over everyone,
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.200]   it's hard to make changes incrementally.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.240]   So this is why I think trap is probably a good word.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.180]   It's hard to get away from that.
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:10.240]   So this article,
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.760]   I'm looking at a couple other points here.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.160]   They say, academia will not be inclusive
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.520]   as long as we fixate on productivity.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.760]   That is absolutely true as well.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.680]   I think when quantity is what matters,
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.360]   then you really begin to sort out
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.160]   who is gonna be able to really excel
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.140]   based in large part about available time they have for work.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:36.000]   The most successful grad student I know, for example,
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.840]   due to visa issues, could never travel,
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.640]   could never go home, was basically stuck here,
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.480]   and just worked 12 hours a day every day,
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.920]   except for three hours on the weekend,
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.560]   on Sundays for exercise, right?
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.960]   So it really makes a difference.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.400]   And then you begin to shift.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:53.040]   And now you're not shifting based on underlying brilliance,
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.280]   impact of ideas.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.920]   You're beginning to sort academic implicit ranking
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.400]   based on how much time do you have available to work,
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.320]   which is that really what we wanna do?
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.360]   You're probably leaving a lot of potential Einsteins
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.280]   on the table if you require anyone
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.080]   who wants to try to be the next Einstein
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.280]   to also have the ability to work as many hours as he does.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.000]   They also say, when we shift the primary goal of writing
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.480]   support to sustainability,
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.680]   we acknowledge that faculty writers
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:22.080]   are valuable resources worth protecting.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:22.920]   From this perspective,
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.840]   valorizing peak productivity is extractive and exploitative
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.560]   of individual writers, one another,
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.120]   and the larger scholarly ecosystem.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.120]   So, I think this is an interesting case study
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.160]   of the issues with completely melding
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.720]   more tactical quantitative notions of productivity
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.800]   with more subjective long-term impactful notions
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.080]   of accomplishment.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.480]   And there's some interesting ideas
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.480]   about what can we do to get away from that.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.200]   It's a hard problem,
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.120]   but I'm glad people are thinking about it.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.760]   I do have one bone to pick.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.800]   I've been picking this bone
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.480]   ever since I first started speaking
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.920]   on doctoral bootcamp committees as a young professor.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.480]   Writing is not the right verb.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.600]   This is my one complaint
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.480]   about people talking about academia.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.240]   Writing is not synonymous with productive,
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.520]   useful, accomplished academic work
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.800]   for mathematicians or computer scientists or physicists.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.920]   Most of the work we do is thinking and proof solving.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.440]   Writing is just what you do at the end
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.000]   to put it into a paper.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.400]   This is a big bugaboo of mine
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.800]   that literally no one else cares about.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.560]   But in a lot of other academic fields,
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.920]   they use the verb writing to mean research.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.800]   And in computer science, I'm on a whiteboard.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.040]   I'm in a notebook.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.760]   Writing is like when you put it all together
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.160]   at the end into a paper that you submit,
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.880]   that takes four days.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.280]   So, I used to terrorize doctoral bootcamps
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.560]   back when I still had time to talk at doctoral bootcamps.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.880]   And I would say, stop using the word writing.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.680]   It's thinking, it's reading, it's trying to solve things.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.640]   It's deep work.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.840]   Some of that actually involves putting words on paper,
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.680]   but not most of it.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.800]   So, that's my one bone to pick
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.040]   that no one else cares about.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.720]   But there's a few other mathematicians out there
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.560]   that are clapping right now.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.280]   They're clapping really loudly.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.320]   Yes, Cal's got it.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.400]   So, anyways, I thought that was interesting, Jesse.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.600]   Here is real world evidence of how other people
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.600]   are identifying and grappling with the same type of issues
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.520]   we talked about today.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.240]   All right, so I think that's all the time we have.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.840]   Thank you for whoever sent in
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.120]   this productivity trap article.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.280]   Thank you for whoever sent in their questions as well.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:30.280]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.280]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.880]   (upbeat music)
