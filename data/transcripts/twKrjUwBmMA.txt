[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   With the biggest wealth transfer in history underway, how people think about money has never
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.660]   mattered more. So today we'll break down what each generation gets right and wrong about saving,
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.140]   spending, and investing so you can learn from their wins and avoid their mistakes. You'll walk
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.900]   away with insights on everything from navigating home ownership and inheritance to knowing when to
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.580]   play it safe and when to take more risk. So whether you're navigating home buying, just starting to
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.440]   save, or figuring out your retirement, there is something here for every generation. And to do all
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.040]   this, I'm joined by Ben Carlson, a seasoned financial advisor and widely respected voice
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.880]   in the space to help you rethink how your financial mindset stacks up and what changes might get you

[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.220]   wealth transfer from boomers to millennials. And I want to get your take on whether it's really a big
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.820]   deal. Like does this even matter for our day to day finances?
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.080]   Probably not as much as most young people would like for now. And I've been we've been having a lot
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.040]   of conversations with clients about this recently, because there's a few things going on here. One of
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.180]   them is the fact that a lot of baby boomers are having a hard time spending the wealth that they've
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.560]   created. Right? So we're having these conversations where people will say, listen, I just want to keep my
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.700]   principal and don't touch it. And I want to spend the dividends and the interest income,
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.580]   everything else just like I don't I'm too nervous to touch it. And because they've been saving for 40
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.320]   years. And they're, you know, they did a really good job, stocking money away. But now having to like
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.020]   flip a switch and go the other way and then spend it down, psychologically really, really challenging for
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.180]   them. And so for a lot of people, it's, it's Oh, no, what if I you know, I have health problems,
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.460]   and I people are living longer, and I don't know what's going to happen with the economy. And I don't
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.100]   know how the markets are going to do going forward. And so that's a big part of it. The other part is
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.680]   that, you know, baby boomers are living longer than any generation that's come before them, right?
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.040]   That's going to be every generation going forward. And so the millennials who are potentially banking
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.520]   on a an inheritance might not get it until their 50s or 60s, right? Because their parents could live
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:22.740]   to their 80s or 90s. I think the stat is, if you're a married couple retiring today, at 65, there is like
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.480]   a 70% chance that one of you will live into your 90s, women live longer than men. So that means again,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.880]   that the younger cohort, the, you know, Gen X millennial are not going to receive that
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.880]   inheritance probably when they need it the most, right? When they're trying to buy a house when
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.480]   they're paying for daycare for their kids. And so a lot of the conversations we're having, you know,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.280]   is do you want to actually have that inheritance come earlier? And does it make sense to spend it now
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.020]   and you can watch your family actually enjoy it when they need it. But a lot of the baby boomer mindset
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.900]   is no, I pass an inheritance down when I die, because that's what my parents did.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.900]   And so there's all sorts of like psychological minefields that we're dealing with here when
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.160]   it comes to this, this money. And you're right, it is a lot of money that's going to be passed down in
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.640]   years ahead. Now, when you think out of the macro sense, it's a massive wealth transfer. Economically
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.680]   speaking, will this have an impact on people's lives who don't get an inheritance? Is it a broader
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.300]   impact on housing prices, the investment markets, that kind of thing? Or is it more a
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.340]   conceptual thing that doesn't really impact the rest of us?
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.620]   I've gotten that question a lot, like, hey, when baby boomers go to sell their stocks,
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.180]   they're going to crash the market, right? And my response to that is one, those sales are going to
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.340]   happen over the course of 20 to 30 years, not going to happen all at once, especially those who
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.680]   had very equity heavy portfolios. They're not just going from 100% stocks to 6040 right away,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.060]   they do it in pieces. And they've been doing this for a while. And a lot of them just hold more cash
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.480]   too. But the other thing is that, as you know, the top 10% own almost 90% of the stocks in this
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.500]   country. And so it's not like there's just this big group of people that's going to go to sell most of
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.400]   that money is going to be passed down, probably. A lot of them that own the most stocks are probably not
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.980]   going to be even touch the majority of it. So yeah, I don't think that it's going to cause this
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.740]   massive problem for the economy or the markets. It's going to be more of a slow drip than like
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.340]   this big tsunami that happens all at once. Now you mentioned, you know, that mindset of boomers is
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.540]   like, this is just what I've done. And it's really got me thinking a lot about the difference between
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.880]   how these different generations think about money and what impact that has on advice we get.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.920]   So I'm curious, like, what are the kind of fundamental differences in financial mindsets
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.760]   for generations from kind of boomers to millennials, and maybe what you see coming up in Gen Z and
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.600]   generations in between?
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.700]   One of the things that we're seeing in the wealth management space is if there is an inheritance
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.800]   and a pass down, it's listen, my parents had a guy that they worked with, and we don't trust this
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.420]   person. There's a lot of older gray haired advisors who aren't really talking to the next generation.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.200]   And that's something that we're trying to do a lot because you want to have everyone in at the
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.880]   table for the conversation. But the other thing is just, you know, I think part of the baby boomer
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.060]   mentality of not spending really has been handed down from their parents, right? Their parents were the
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.960]   the live through the Great Depression. And so a lot of them still have that mindset of,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.400]   I have to really have a backup plan for a backup plan. And I don't want to get caught stuck if
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.480]   something doesn't work out. And I think it's been supercharged this decade, really, because a lot of
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.820]   millennials were, you know, they felt some scars from the Great Recession, the 2008 crash, right?
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.220]   People, there was all these stories in the 2010s of millennials are shunning risk, and they're not
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.880]   investing in stocks very much. They saw their parents live through it, and they started to live
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.380]   through the stock market crashes. And it was kind of scary. And the 2020s, I think, has completely
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.120]   switched. And it's really fascinating to me to watch because I was of the opinion that,
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.620]   okay, this really was a pandemic phenomenon. Because remember at the beginning of the pandemic,
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.300]   when everyone started going crazy and day trading and open Robinhood accounts, and people said,
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.340]   well, that's just because a lot of people aren't working right now. And there's no professional
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.780]   sports on right now to gamble. And once that stuff opens back up, and people are going back into the
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.540]   offices, and they can gamble on sports again, it's just a fad, right? And then we got the meme stock
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.020]   craze. And it's like, okay, once this goes away, then people will get back to it. And it doesn't
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:38.440]   seem like it's going away. It's only strengthened. And there's millions of new investors now. The stat
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.300]   I keep coming back to, I talked to one of the head people from Robinhood a couple weeks ago on my
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.340]   podcast. And he said that they have 26 million customers, and 13 million of them, it's their first
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.760]   brokerage account they've ever opened. So these are brand new investors into the markets. And they are
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.560]   more comfortable with risk, because think about all the people who invested in crypto, it wasn't
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.300]   institutions, it was regular retail people, right? And they've lived through how many 75% drawdowns in the
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.940]   last 10 years. And so I think that the younger generation is just more comfortable with speculation,
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:17.260]   because they're doing it, they're betting on events now with Calci and Polymarket, right? They're day trading
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:23.260]   stocks, they're investing in crypto, they're also gambling on sports, that's in like taxable account with their
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:29.200]   other stuff that's tax deferred, they're investing in target date funds and index funds and ETFs. And so there's this
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.160]   dichotomy where they have this stuff where they're having fun in it, for them, it's part investing in part
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.540]   entertainment and part like lottery ticket, like I, I've seen people, you know, hit it big, and maybe I can do that too. And so I just
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:46.500]   think the acceptance of risk is this, this decade is something that really interests me, because people keep
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.560]   thinking that it's just going to go away. But what if this is a whole generation of people who are just
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.640]   more willing to take risk? And I don't know where that leads us like for the markets, it could be, do we have
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:02.440]   more booms and busts because of this mentality? I don't know, but it's interesting to contemplate.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:10.800]   Yeah. And what about kind of the outlooks, not just on investing, but where do major kind of personal investments
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:18.020]   like homes and the housing market fit into these generational mindsets? And kind of how do the macro events that are
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.900]   shaping these generations affect that?
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:26.420]   I think one of the reasons that so many people are comfortable, you know, saving and investing more is some people are just shut out of the
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:32.480]   housing market. Fidelity had a study recently that said the average savings rate is now like 14%, which, which I was
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.140]   kind of blown away by I never would have thought it would have been that high. And we're hearing from a lot of people that
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:42.680]   listen, I can't afford a house right now, or it would take me way too long to save for down payment. So instead, I'm
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:49.100]   saving and investing more, or I'm traveling more. Obviously, I think the whole American dream thing with the housing is still
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.100]   prevalent. Like there's still people who are buying houses. There's not a lot of activity going on right now, because
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:09:00.180]   mortgage rates are so high and housing prices are so high. But I think that is still something that people aspire to. It's just
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:06.660]   happening much later in life for people. I think they said the average age of first time homebuyers has gone from 31 to 38. And that
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:12.180]   happened pretty quickly. And so I think people are just having to put this stuff off until later in life when they start
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.220]   making more money. Now, one of the things I think about is if you look, if you are a millennial, and you remember what
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:23.340]   mortgage rates were, you know, in the last 1015 years, it feels like they're really high. But if you
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:29.600]   have lived decades, you know, is this the new normal? Like, do we just at some point have to get used to this
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.740]   world we live in? If you look historically, I think going back to like 1970s, the current mortgage rate is
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:41.540]   about average, which is which is hard to believe. The problem is, is that the readjustment period happens so
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:47.460]   fast, we've never had a period where we went from such low rates to high rates this quickly. And plus,
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:53.140]   you had the 50% spike in housing prices. So in that sense, I really do feel for the young people who
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:10:01.620]   mistimed it for no other reason than bad luck, right? If you bought a house pre 2021, you lucked out and
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.940]   you got 3% mortgage rates, you had the ability to refinance and you also are sitting on a ton of equity.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.660]   equity. And if you just happened to miss that, because life events are the fact of when you
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.820]   graduated school, or it just didn't work out for you, and you were going to buy later, and you just
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:21.460]   didn't do it. I really do feel for those people. If you asked people today, you know, could you afford
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.380]   your own house today at current mortgage rates, I wonder how many people would say probably not,
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.540]   or it would be a really big financial strain on us. Alternatively, the people who locked in those low
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.860]   rates and locked in lower housing prices, think about how much more disposable income they have,
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.540]   than if they're out there trying to buy today. So I think that's another piece of the risk pie.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:45.540]   This decade is just the consumer spending. If I mean, remember, travel was another one that people
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.260]   said, well, that's going to die down eventually. Doesn't it now seem like people assume two to three
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:56.500]   trips a year, and a lot of cases, like, that's their God given, right? Yeah, it's that mentality
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:02.980]   has gone from a luxury to a need, essentially, for a lot of people, I think their thing that attracted me
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:09.860]   most to the points miles travel hacking game is just that you could attack this huge part of
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.820]   discretionary spending. But I also had that same mentality. Like it, despite that, as a kid,
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:21.300]   it wasn't necessarily the thing. It now feels like, how could we spend the whole summer at home? I don't
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:26.420]   know how that's evolved, but I know that wasn't the case for my parents. When I was growing up,
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:32.100]   that was the same thing. Yeah, we didn't expect to go on these extravagant vacations and travel to
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:38.660]   Europe or go somewhere really nice every time for spring break. But that is sort of the mentality
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.140]   these days. And the hard part for people is trying to keep up with that, right? Am I saving and investing,
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:48.580]   but also spending and enjoying myself? And I think that piece is probably harder than ever. And you add in
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.900]   the social media element of I'm watching all my friends share the vacations they're going on,
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.380]   and I feel left out. Why aren't we doing this? I think for people at a certain age, you know,
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:05.140]   in your 30s and maybe early 40s, it's never been easier to really spend a lot of money and then think,
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.900]   like, how am I not getting ahead more than I am because of how much money I'm making?
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.980]   I will say, and you've probably seen the same because when I ran my financial planning firm,
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:18.580]   I was just surprised that there are a lot of people that are living that life and they're just not
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.460]   saving. When you look at what everyone else is doing, unless you have the full picture of,
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.500]   you know, where's money going? How much money is being saved? You might think, well, these people
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.380]   have a nice house. They're going on vacations. Why can't I do that? But I have seen multiple people's
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.740]   balance sheets and it's like, oh, they have no savings. So if you're building up your savings,
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:44.100]   and not able to keep up with those people, like the tables may turn in the future and you might
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.820]   be in a lot better position. And it's just, it's funny how no one ever posts like, here's my vacation
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:54.180]   photo alongside, here's my debt and income and my balance sheet. Back to the original point we made
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.700]   about inheritances. I think I have a handful of friends who have parents who are relatively well
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.580]   off who are assuming, well, that's my retirement nest egg, right? I'm going to spend it all because I
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.580]   have that coming. And that's a very risky game to play. Like I said, because you
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.460]   might not get it until much later in life. And if you're not developing those habits,
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.460]   and potentially if people are living longer, maybe the nest egg gets whittled down further
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:23.300]   than you thought. And so, yeah, you're right. I always wonder when I see someone driving one of
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.820]   these $90,000 trucks, and I have nothing against people who have trucks, but I always look at them
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.140]   and I say, man, that's got to be a $90,000, $95,000 truck. I wonder how much they have in their 529
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.900]   plan or their IRA or these types of things. And that's the other side of it, obviously.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.780]   This episode is brought to you by Superhuman. Now I've used Superhuman for years, and I think
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:47.700]   it's hands down the best way to do email, assuming you value your time, which I absolutely assume you

[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.260]   So if you look across generations, are there things that you would pick out if you could kind of
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:03.300]   define the personal financial mindset that's kind of ideal? What do boomers get right? What does Gen X get
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.300]   right? What does Gen Y get right?
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:11.380]   I'm generalizing here. There have been plenty of boomers who really did figure out the way to save
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:15.860]   and invest over a 30 to 40-year period. And I know everyone thinks that boomers had it easy,
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.660]   but they had these 70s to live through with inflation and high mortgage rates in the 80s and
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.620]   the dual crashes in the first decade of this century. They saved and invested from their 401k
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:30.100]   plan and their IRA over time. The market has done a lot of the heavy lifting for them. And we get a lot
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.580]   of those people who are DIY people coming to our wealth management practice who have just saved and
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.460]   you know, over time built wealth. So I think a lot of baby boomers did a really good job
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:44.500]   with that. And again, the hard part for them is then turning around and spending it and enjoying it.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.940]   I think millennials are kind of have a foot in each camp. We lived through the great recession. So we
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:57.300]   understand risk, you know, and so I think millennials have a more balanced view of this thing. And again,
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.740]   if you were able to buy a house as a millennial, I think you're probably sitting in a pretty good position
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.620]   these days. The thing that worries me about Gen Z, and I think they'll snap out of it, hopefully,
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:10.820]   is just the financial nihilism, just the nothing matters. So I'm just going to take these crazy risks
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:18.660]   and hope something works out because the old nine to five, put it in the 401k, build wealth slowly.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.660]   That's for a prior generation. And this isn't everyone there, obviously, but I think there is
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.540]   a little bit of that, you know, nothing matters. So let's just put it on red or black and see what
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.980]   happens. And I think people do graduate from that mindset eventually. But again, I think the fact that
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:39.060]   that generation has technology and a risk mindset, I think most of them will be okay. And I think a lot
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.300]   of them are starting to invest earlier and get experience. And so even if they
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:50.980]   blow themselves up trading triple levered ETFs or options, you know, date, you know, same day options,
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:56.100]   wherever it is, if they're doing it with less money before they start saving and putting stuff away,
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.660]   eventually those habits change and they realize like, okay, maybe I need more of a slow and steady
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.900]   approach. And I think that's what we're seeing is a lot of them get it out of their system after they
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.580]   really also hard it is to do those things. I know when I've looked at the housing market
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:15.380]   historically, like investments are a better return typically than, you know, a house. But is there
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:21.060]   any argument to be made that people who are out outside of the housing market right now because
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.980]   it's too expensive and are investing could end up being better in the long run?
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.740]   So I've actually written about this before. I've tried to come up with like,
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.580]   what is the actual return on housing? Because if you look at like Robert Schiller's historical
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:37.940]   housing market data, essentially, over the long run, it equals about the rate of inflation,
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.100]   which is not not a terrible thing. But then you have to put in the leverage there. And then you have
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.700]   to talk about well, you have to live somewhere. So there's like implied rent, because you're not
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.500]   renting somewhere else, you're you're you have to have a roof over your head.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.380]   And implied inflation is like three ish percent.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.980]   Yeah, it's like three, three to 4%, something like that. But then you also have all the ancillary
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.460]   costs, the the property taxes and insurance and all the stuff you buy for your home.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.740]   And so my stance is like no one ever really knows what their actual return is. I don't know,
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.620]   maybe you have the spreadsheet of all the costs that you've ever done in housing.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.100]   But I don't think there's anyone who has the actual return. And maybe that's okay,
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.980]   because I don't view a house as an investment as much as it's, it's kind of a form of consumption.
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.140]   And it's a valuable financial asset. But yeah, you're right. If you just did an apples to apples
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.780]   comparison of the return, you're probably doing better off. Yeah, investing in the stock market,
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:31.220]   even though housing has done so well this decade. And if you bought a house in 2020 with a 3%
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:37.940]   mortgage, and then you had 50% returns, and the leverage, you probably did pretty great. But that'll
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.340]   slowly but surely be whittled away as returns aren't as high going forward. But yeah, the people
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.620]   who are just investing in the stock market are probably in a better financial.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.340]   Like the stock market also did really well over the last decade.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:54.980]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's up 14% per year in the 2020s, and did just as well in the 2010.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:00.500]   And so for someone who, you know, didn't buy the house in 2020 didn't get the 3% mortgage rate.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.500]   But you know, whether it's the American dream, whether it's they just want to own a home,
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.980]   is there ever going to be a good time to get in?
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:13.220]   And so it's funny, because I had people reaching out to me in 2021, right after the housing prices
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:18.420]   started taking off. And they said, I can't do it, housing prices are up 20%. Remember, there was all
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.780]   these, there was bidding wars and non contingent sales, and we're not going to do an inspection.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.700]   And there was all these crazy lines out the door, because there was this housing boom. And I had a lot
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.500]   of people say, I'm going to sit this out and wait until the craziness subsides. And my stance is always,
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.260]   don't try to time the housing market. Because people who have said, I'm just going to wait for
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:41.940]   mortgage rates to fall. And we're still at 7% mortgage rates. And so my thing is, if you find
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.620]   a house that you like that you're going to willing to own for seven to 10 years at a minimum, that's a
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.980]   big key is you don't want to trade out trade around in houses, because the cost frictions are so high,
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.700]   and you pay most of your mortgage and interest for the first few years, it doesn't make sense to trade
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.980]   houses, I think you could probably skip the starter home these days, if you can and buy a house you're
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.220]   willing to stay in for 10 or 15 years. But I just think if you can afford to service the
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.980]   debt on it, and you find a house you like, don't worry about timing it and waiting for the perfect
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:14.100]   mortgage rate, or the perfect time, you just do it when you can afford it. I don't like the idea of
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.820]   trying to time the housing market like it's buying a stock or something.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.220]   I mean, I also don't like the idea of trying to time the market, you know, the stock market either.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.900]   But right, true.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.300]   If someone were to say, hey, I'm just going to wait till mortgage rates drop. And the answer is okay,
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.380]   well, if they don't drop, what are you going to do? It's like, well, if they don't drop,
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.220]   then I'll bite the bullet. You can refinance if they drop unless your answer is I will never buy
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.940]   a home unless mortgage rates drop. You know, you can kind of hedge by saying if I really think
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.540]   they're going to drop, as long as you can afford it now. I think that's the big thing. You don't want
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.700]   to get over your skis and make an investment that if mortgage rates don't drop, you can't continue to
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.260]   hold because it kind of reminds me of all the interest only mortgages that had these balloon
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.700]   payments and people were just kind of expecting my salary will be more in the future.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.260]   Uh, that's probably not great.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.900]   Well, and the hard part is when mortgage rates do drop. So let's say they go from seven to five.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.780]   My guess is that there's going to be a ton of demand coming off the sideline and then maybe it's harder
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.740]   to buy because you have more competition. So that that's why timing it is so difficult. Like I'll just
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.340]   wait for housing prices to fall 10% and mortgage rates to drop and getting that threading that needle
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.700]   is probably impossible these days. And again, yeah, just do it when you can afford.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.860]   We did so much market research talking to customers when I was working at Wealthfront and
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.500]   every single person felt every single year that the market was overpriced. And they were like,
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.460]   I want to get in the market. It's overpriced right now. Like I'm going to wait a couple years.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:38.740]   Well, it turns out that pandemic aside, the last 10 years, like you kind of didn't want to miss out.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:44.900]   Right? Yes. Yeah. It's, and I think a lot of people do have that mindset of
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.340]   I'm going to buy when it's my time to buy. I think it's more the spreadsheet warriors who
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.260]   try to time it and overthink things and the people who don't overthink it and just realize like,
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.780]   Hey, I just got married or I'm having kids. It's time to buy a house. The life event is more
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.860]   apps to make sense than, than the financial decision, even though you still have to run
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.980]   the numbers, obviously. Yeah. And I think past 2008, skip the pandemic. Cause that was kind of a,
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:15.460]   an anomaly event in a way we haven't had a major market correction, right? Like anything really,
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:20.020]   really significant that didn't recover quickly. I've looked at this in the past. The housing market
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:25.220]   does not fall that often nationwide in certain markets, obviously in their markets right now,
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.980]   in like Texas and Florida, that just got so overheated that the prices are coming in and the supply is,
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:36.420]   is, is rising. But on a nationwide basis, even during recessions, I looked at this, I think
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.380]   in something like seven out of the past nine recessions, housing prices have risen.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:47.940]   So people think that the housing crisis in 2008 is the norm, but that is an outlier. It doesn't happen
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:53.860]   all that often. And so if you're waiting for this big fat pitch, it just might not come. And, and again,
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:58.420]   it's because housing houses don't trade like stocks, right? You don't see the prices every
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.580]   day. People aren't able to panic because it's an illiquid asset. When you've talked to people or
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:08.500]   looked at historically, has everyone for the history of time always felt like everything's expensive
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.220]   right now and everything's overpriced. Like I haven't been in the market per se for, you know,
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:20.340]   five, 10 decades, but it seems like my experience the last 20 years is that everyone always thinks
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.220]   everything's expensive unless a recession has just hit.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:27.380]   Yeah. So there's a guy, uh, John Reckenfeller, one of my favorite personal finance columnists at
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.740]   Morningstar retired, uh, a couple months ago. And he wrote this piece. His last piece was all about
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:37.380]   the stock market. And he said he'd been investing since 1987. Every year since then, people have
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:42.260]   thought the stock market was overvalued. What if this is it? And I missed the boat. And he said,
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.580]   every time they've been wrong. And think about how many people have tried to call the next crash ever
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.300]   since 2008 that, you know, look at the Cape ratio and look at this and the stock market is overvalued.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:57.780]   And what happens when Apple hits a trillion dollars and that's the sign. And yes, I think that trying
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.620]   to play that game is just better left for professionals. And even they can't do it.
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:06.020]   I know you wrote this piece a while back about financial advice that doesn't work anymore. And
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:10.820]   I'm wondering if there are any other lessons that we've maybe picked up from our parents' generation
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:16.420]   that maybe for a younger generation right now, or even for that older generation living right now,
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:20.340]   you know, maybe those are things that they should kind of leave by the wayside.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.220]   Well, I think one of them I wrote in there, since we're talking about the housing market,
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:27.300]   is that you need to have a 20% down payment to buy a house. And I think for people,
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.300]   for most people, that's almost impossible these days, especially living, think about where you
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:36.580]   live in California, how long would it take people to save up that money unless they have some stock
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:41.460]   options from a company they work at or something. And so I think it's okay to, you know,
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.860]   put five to 10% down on your first house. I think our first house, we put 5% down. And
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:51.700]   it seems imprudent for some reason. But again, as long as you can afford that monthly payment and
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.420]   all the ancillary costs, I don't think that's a big deal. Now, I feel like a lot of the personal
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.260]   finance experts might've shunned me for this one. But I say, especially early on, the whole idea that
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:05.460]   you need to have 12 months of savings and emergency fund, I think that's almost impossible for people
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:12.180]   just starting out. It's a goal that is something that you can work for. But again, I think if that's your
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.660]   only goal, you're going to probably have other financial goals that fall by the wayside. And so
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:21.700]   I think it's okay to like, put a toe in the water and slowly but surely build these things up over time.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.980]   Building up your savings rate, like slowly increase it every time you get a raise or every year,
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:31.540]   right? And, and start out with one month of emergency fund savings, and then work up to two,
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:37.460]   three and four and slowly but surely get there and not try to just do everything all at once. I think
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.620]   people in the personal finance world often kind of look down on that stuff.
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:46.980]   And just the other one that I've completely changed my mind on, I've always been the spreadsheet
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.980]   warrior. For whatever reason, I think part of it was, I think a lot of people get their financial
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.980]   habits, it's half your personality and half your upbringing, some combination thereof.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:01.540]   And my parents did a really good job instilling in me the savings habits. And my dad always talked
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.740]   about just don't have credit card debt. Like that was the one thing that was drilled into me from an
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.500]   early age. Don't have credit card debt, it's one of the worst decisions you can make. And I still
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.980]   believe that. But I think especially since I've had kids, the idea of just spending money and enjoying
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:18.100]   some of it now, that has been a big mindset shift for me that if you would have told me that in my 20s and
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:23.300]   early 30s, I would have said, you're nuts. No, you think about how much you're giving up on compounding
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:28.740]   interest over time and all these things. And I do think that's one of the areas where the younger
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:34.020]   generation has learned to enjoy themselves more. Now, older generations may look at them and say,
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:40.340]   well, they're overdoing it. They're spending way too much money. But I think that that mindset shift
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:45.700]   is way different now of just things like paying for convenience and, and again, traveling and,
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.420]   and paying for experiences. I think that's something that a younger generation gets right,
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.220]   that the older generation probably didn't spend enough time thinking.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.980]   How did you make that transition? I know there are a lot of people listening who kind of
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:03.700]   fall in the frugal, heavy saving mindset. And so it's hard to like actually recalibrate to say,
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.060]   let's spend some money. You know, like I can look back to moments where I was like,
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:12.660]   I'd love an appetizer, but like, do I really want to pay an extra $7? It's just hard for me
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:18.260]   to learn to spend and I've had to get better. But I feel like when I hear you on your show talking,
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.740]   it's actually, you've kind of changed your habits without a gigantic windfall.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:29.140]   So a couple of things, I think I did baby steps at first. So when I first got out of college and I'm
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:34.900]   trying to learn about markets, this is pre podcasting and pre YouTube. And I had to go to the library and
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.500]   start reading books because I was so far behind and I didn't have a lot of knowledge.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.140]   I realized that in my first job, like, Oh my gosh, I have textbook knowledge,
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.580]   but I don't really understand how the markets work and how behavioral psychology works.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.060]   And so I would go to the library. And if there was a book I really wanted,
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.180]   and it wasn't there, I would just have to wait for it. And this is my frugal mindset going,
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.860]   okay, I'll just wait till it's ready. And six months later, I'm still waiting in line.
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:58.740]   And at a certain point, I just said to myself, why am I not just spending $9.99 on Amazon to buy this book?
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.980]   And so I gave myself permission that anytime you want to buy a book, just buy it.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.300]   Right. It's good. This is going to help your career. It's going to help your knowledge. Like
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.780]   it's going to be a good thing for you. So in categories like that, give yourself permission
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.540]   to just spend on those certain categories. Right. That's not everything. It's just,
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:21.060]   that's one or two things. And the other thing I did is I started just making it part of my savings
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:26.900]   budget. Right. So I, I turned the dial up on my vacation fund. And so every month,
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.300]   a certain amount goes into my high yield savings account. And it's just bucketed for taking a
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:36.100]   vacation because my wife and I had to talk about this. And I just said, what, what is important to
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.340]   you in terms of spending? And this is when we had kids, she said, I want to go on more trips because
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.140]   the first couple of years of having twins, we could not go on vacations because it was just too hard.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:51.380]   The strollers and the double car seats and all the stuff that they need. It was impossible. So
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.460]   after, after we got through that period, my wife just said, I want to make this a priority in our
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.900]   finances. And so we dialed up that savings. And even if it meant not money, not going into our
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:06.580]   retirement accounts or whatever, it, it, it's something that we, we created as a monthly part of
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:11.380]   our budget. I track, you know, how much we'd save every year, obviously, as a personal finance guy,
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.620]   I showed my wife, here's our savings by year. And I plotted it out in a, in a bar chart.
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:21.300]   And we had this outlier year in 2021. And I think it's probably partly pandemic related.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.180]   We just saved way more money than we'd ever saved before. And I think part of it is we weren't quite
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:32.340]   traveling yet. And I said, what are we doing here? Why, why did we all of a sudden ramp this up so
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:37.140]   quickly? Cause I like slowly, but surely saving more money. And my wife said, maybe we need to just
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:41.220]   increase the spending a little more too, then, and not have the savings jump that high.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:45.060]   And so in recent years, since 2021, that's like a high watermark for me.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:50.260]   And we've made a conscious decision to, Hey, we're still hitting our savings goal, but we don't need
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:56.020]   to like overdo it so much. It's something that was a multi-year thing for me where I had to slowly,
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:01.700]   but surely ease into it. I say that there, you should save enough money where sometimes it's
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:07.220]   painful where you go, geez, I could be taking a vacation to Hawaii with how much money I put into
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:12.500]   my 401k or IRA this year. Right. And you kind of think that, but on the other end, you're spending
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.660]   enough money where you go, geez, in 30 years, can you imagine how much money this would be worth?
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:21.060]   And I think you have to kind of go back and forth between these two camps. That's like the balance
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:21.780]   you're trying to strike.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:27.380]   Now, maybe it's a complicated model, but is there something that gives you the confidence
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:31.300]   that the amount you're saving, which might be less because you've, you know, dialed up some of your
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.940]   spending is still enough. The idea of coast fire, right? You save a lot of money and then you let
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:43.540]   it compound. I think because my wife and I started saving early, seeing the compounding over time and
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:48.340]   then doing some calculations of in 20 years, here's what this is going to be when we decide to retire,
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:53.140]   whatever it is. Saving early was a big thing that's given me confidence where I don't have
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:58.580]   to keep, you know, plowing in and not in delaying the gratification. And so I think that's part of it,
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:04.340]   too, that we did so well saving in our twenties and we weren't making a ton of money and we weren't saving
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.780]   it a lot, but we did so on a regular basis and we slowly but surely increase. And so I think having that
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:15.700]   piece where I think of the compounding benefits and you never know how the future is going to turn out,
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:20.340]   but that gives me some sort of peace of mind that, okay, we've been saving for 20 years
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:26.260]   and it's going to keep compounding, even if it's at a lower rate than it has for the past 20. I think
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.980]   we're still in a pretty good place. So that's given me some peace of mind, too.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:34.100]   Yeah. And I think sometimes it comes across like coast fire is not a is not a spectrum, but
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.820]   you know, it's like, oh, well, I have enough money that I don't have to save or I don't have
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.460]   enough money. So I have to save everything. And there's obviously spectrum in there. Like
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.380]   you and I probably might feel like we have a good amount of savings. That doesn't mean we never put
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:52.660]   more money in savings. Like I'm putting money in retirement accounts and 529s and I'm still saving.
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:58.420]   But similarly, I've realized what we've been saving so much. Are we going to be okay if we just save a
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:04.100]   little less for a few years when we think that's the right time? And I will say it's tough to model
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.500]   that out. Like there are, I'm going to do a whole episode on these like net worth modeling tools. And
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.780]   sometimes it's just hard to know if that's going to be enough because who knows how long it's going to
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.700]   be, who knows what's going to happen with the markets. And even these tools, if you dial the
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:23.140]   assumption for your rate of return up by one or 2%, it's like you're going to retire with millions of
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:28.500]   dollars or you're going to run out of money. So I guess at some point, the thing that gives me
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:34.260]   confidence is, well, you know what? If the markets don't stop returning like they have the last 10
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:40.180]   years, your spending is a knob you can change, right? If you go buy a house, you could sell it,
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:45.060]   but that's a harder thing. But if you spend a little more on vacations in years when the market's good,
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:49.940]   and then all of a sudden we're in a really big problem, you could stop going to vacation.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.740]   If you were spending it on private school, you could put your kids in public school.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:58.900]   Like the nice thing about flexing on, on kind of variable spending is that you can change it.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.820]   If the underlying assumptions change, you lose your job, you know, you get a windfall,
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.220]   you could dial it up. You know, there's, there's that flexibility.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.740]   And that's the conversation that we have with wealth management clients.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.580]   You know, the, the 4% rule for retirement withdrawals, it's a rule that maybe 1% of the
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:17.860]   population actually does in, you know, in reality, because most people spend more money in their
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.020]   sixties than they do in their seventies and their eighties, right?
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.100]   Because their health slows down. They don't travel as much.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.900]   But also when things are going good, people tend to spend more.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.580]   And when things are going bad, they tend to reign it in.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.860]   And I think that's actually okay to have some variability there.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:34.020]   And we tell that with clients, like we're going to use a baseline for a percentage of spending,
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.380]   but it's more based on your budget. And then we're going to have conversations.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.140]   Okay. Here's what the market actually did.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.500]   Maybe you can turn the knob up a little bit, or, Hey, things are worse.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.260]   If you're a little worried, maybe dial it back this year. Don't take that fourth vacation or
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:51.220]   whatever it is. And so I think that having some flexibility, that's the whole point of financial
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.340]   planning and why we always tell people that it's a process and not an event.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.580]   It's not something that you lay out on day one and say, this is exactly how it's going to go.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:04.100]   Because I look at my own life and think through all the different changes and career paths and savings
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.660]   and investment vehicles that have happened and how the market has turned out.
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.820]   I don't think I could have possibly ever thought the market would have done
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.820]   this well coming out of the great financial crisis.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.740]   We're looking at like a 15 year bull market, depending on how you define these things.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:23.540]   We've had setbacks along the way, but I think back to the way people were talking in 2010, 11, 12,
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.460]   and people were still so worried about the state of the world and the market is,
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:33.060]   what if it just takes so long to come back? And so I think trying to predict these things is just
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.580]   so difficult to do. So yeah, to your point, if you're just a little more flexible with it,
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:41.620]   that's the key. This episode is brought to you by Notion. Now I'm always juggling everything from
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:46.580]   goal setting for the business, to outlining big projects, to planning travel. And I do it all in

[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:58.500]   just thinking about things like Social Security? I know a lot of my peers look at their parents like
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:03.300]   that's subsidizing their cost of living, you know, depending on where they live in the country,
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:08.100]   like significantly to somewhat. I feel like we've been talking for 20 years about the future of this
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:13.620]   program. And do you factor that in when you think about your future or clients' futures?
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:18.340]   Okay, so I feel very strongly about this and I've written about this a lot. The fact that millennials,
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:24.020]   some of them think, well, Social Security is not going to be there for me. And I think it would be
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:29.940]   crazy if it wasn't. So there's this thing where in 2034, right, the amount of money coming in, it's going
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:35.780]   to be exceeded by the money that's coming out to make payments. People think, oh, that means it's insolvent.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:40.900]   All that it means is that that money is going to have to come from somewhere else. And I can't imagine
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:48.100]   that any politician in their right mind would cut Social Security. Maybe I'm wrong. All it means is that,
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:53.940]   you know, if they really did, you'd receive 90 or 80 cents in the dollar. So I still think you can factor
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:58.260]   it in. And Social Security is another psychological versus spreadsheet one that we deal with because
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:04.660]   the numbers are, if you wait to get it until you're 70, it's something like an 8% per year return.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:08.740]   It's almost like the stock market and your amount you're going to get on a monthly basis is that much
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:16.180]   higher. So it's like 70% higher at 70 versus 62 when you take it. But we see most people still
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:21.540]   decide to take it at 62 or 65, right? They take it earlier. And I've been having conversations with
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:26.740]   people about this. And they kind of do some, you know, break even if I just took the money and invested
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:31.300]   it or whatever would be fine, or it would take me until I'm 85 to break even or whatever the number is.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.140]   And most people just say, I would just prefer to take it now for peace of mind.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.860]   Even though the spreadsheet answer tells me, if I just wait a little longer, it's going to be much
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:44.900]   higher when I'm 70. Most people just feel more comfortable and just want to spend it now. It's
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:49.540]   kind of like, it's my money. Why wouldn't I get it earlier at 62 or 65 or something like that? I want
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:54.340]   to have to wait until I'm 70 to do it. So it's one of those ones where people say, I know this doesn't
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.260]   make sense on the spreadsheet, but I don't care. I'm going to take it now anyway, because it just,
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.780]   it makes me feel safer.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:05.780]   Yeah. I similarly believe that it would be wild if everyone contributed to this program and there's
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.380]   statements showing how much money you've put into this program. And then they're like, all right,
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:14.980]   it's gone. Like that seems crazy. Do they push back ages because we're living longer? I don't know.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.340]   That seems somewhat reasonable.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:20.180]   This is one of the easier programs to fix if people ever decide to do it. Yeah. If they say
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:25.220]   over the age of 45, your grandfather in or 50, but under that, now your retirement date is this
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:29.060]   because you're living longer that. So social security to me is an easy one to much easier
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.580]   to fix in some of the other programs.
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:35.860]   Yeah. Okay. Well, we won't go down a list of programs right now, but we, we talked about kind
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:40.740]   of you thought in the wake of the great financial crisis, there's lots of volatility. What's going to
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:46.020]   happen. I feel like in the last two or three months, like with tariffs and whatnot, it just feels
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:52.580]   like we live in a world where we can have swings that used to be like an annual return in a week.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:58.180]   How are you thinking about the way you invest or is anything changing
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.300]   other than giving lots of good fodder for conversation?
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:06.900]   I definitely think markets are happening faster. Cycles happen faster. The market prices things in
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.300]   way faster. And that's why we're seeing these bear markets happen quicker, but then the recoveries
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.700]   happen quicker. And so part of me thinks that these boom bust cycles are
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.140]   just going to happen more often. Like we've had three bear markets this decade already,
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:23.620]   right? In the, in the course of six years. And obviously sometimes it's not going to snap back
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:28.180]   so quickly, the information age and the speed of information, the amount of algorithms that are
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.420]   operating in the market, where it's like act first, think later. The hard part is,
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:38.340]   is that it's, it's giving more opportunities for people to panic. And I, I talked to a lot of
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:43.940]   people who, when the liberation day stuff happened and the tariffs kicked in, they sold some of their
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:47.780]   stocks. And these are people who held through a lot of other bear markets in the past. And they
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.540]   said, I know what the impact of tariffs are going to be. And so I think the problem with that is it,
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:56.500]   is it does give you more opportunity to mess up and make a market timing mistake.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.220]   Now on the other side of that, I've been pounding the drum on this for a while. It's interesting to
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:06.900]   see how many people look at volatility as an opportunity now. And it's not a panic situation.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:12.340]   It's no, I'm going to dive into the fire and I'm going to buy. And you saw record amounts of retail
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.860]   buying in April when the stock market fell. And it's interesting to live in a world where
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:24.020]   investor behavior, I think has actually improved for the better, right? That's not everyone. There's still
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:29.060]   people who are speculating and taking on too much leverage and day trading and market timing and all
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:36.180]   these things. But I think a majority of people now have actually learned because it's been beaten to
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:42.100]   their head for the past 10, 20, 30 years. Listen, when the stock market falls, you don't run out of the
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.660]   store because stocks are on sale. You run into the burning building and you buy. And more people have
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:53.460]   done that, I think, than ever before. And I think that's a great thing, but you do wonder if it makes it
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.260]   so these cycles just play out differently if they didn't pass.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.540]   Yeah. And people are like, well, I don't want to invest because I could just wait for the next
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:05.140]   crash because they're happening so fast. Whereas I think earlier in my investing career, sure, when
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:10.340]   2008 happened, I didn't have money to invest. So it wasn't a buying opportunity for me, but I didn't
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:16.340]   have this belief that there would be another one so soon. So I just slowly kept putting whatever I could
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:21.380]   in. And now a part of me is like, gosh, if these swings are so great, should I just be keeping
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:27.460]   every amount of savings on the sideline in cash and just constantly time the short crashes, which
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:33.300]   just both feels like a good idea and also feels like a terrible idea at the same time.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:39.860]   Yes. I've just realized that I've seen enough professional investors over the years try to do
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:45.460]   this and just fail. And I think almost everyone is just better off putting it in on a regular basis,
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:50.180]   a weekly, a monthly, a bi-monthly, whatever it is. I think that's just so much easier. And you
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:55.300]   mentioned the 2008 crash. That's when I really first started investing. And I still remember I had a
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.620]   colleague who was older. He was in his 50s and it looked like the world was falling apart. And we had
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:05.620]   a hedge fund manager in September tell us, listen, this is a Friday. He said, go to the ATM, take as
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.460]   much cash out as you can now, because on Monday, you might not be able to get any cash out of the bank.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:14.180]   Like it was, it was a scary situation. And this guy in his 50s is telling me, listen, Ben,
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:20.900]   take all of your 401k contributions and put them in the stable value fund, because this, this is looking
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.060]   really bad. And my thinking at the time, I'm, you know, I'm reading all these Warren Buffett books
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:30.500]   about the fat pitches and, you know, being greedy when others are fearful. And I just thought to
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:34.980]   myself, the stock market is down almost 60%. I'm never in my lifetime going to be able to buy
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:41.620]   at this, these low prices again, right? Even if they go lower from here. And I think that's the
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:45.380]   mindset. And I do think people have learned that because there was enough people who got out of the
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:50.020]   stock market for whatever reason, some of it was because they panicked. Some people just had to have
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.540]   money because they needed it for other things because they were losing their house or whatever.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:58.100]   But I think enough people saw people panic during the great depression and have kind of learned from
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:02.580]   that behavior. And it's interesting to see. And I think that's part of the reason that the market
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:08.580]   snaps back so quickly. You have all these automatic contributions going in to 401ks and IRAs. Unlike ever
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.580]   we've ever seen before, people are putting money into their brokerage account on a regular basis.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:18.500]   The barriers to entry have been taken down because it's so easy to invest in Robinhood. Think about how hard it
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:23.140]   was to invest in the 1980s. You had to go to a brick and mortar building for Merrill Lynch or
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:28.980]   something, write a checkout, fill out all this paperwork. It would take a few days. Then the
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:33.700]   check would clear. Then you could invest. You open a Robinhood account, now link your bank account,
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.540]   and you can invest in five minutes.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:40.420]   It's so funny. You use Merrill Lynch as the example. I recently opened up a business brokerage
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:46.820]   account at Merrill Lynch, and it can only be opened up by ink signature, paper application. Business brokerage
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:51.300]   accounts live in like the 1980s version of opening a brokerage account. And I was like,
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:56.100]   this, it took eight tries and three weeks to open the account. And I was like, oh my gosh,
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.740]   like if that's what it was like for consumers, it was hard.
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:03.700]   A lot of people see this behavior and they worry about the downsides. Like what happens when people
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:08.180]   go in to buy the dip and the stock market keeps going down and we get an actual financial crisis
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:13.380]   situation? Then what's going to happen? That'll be interesting. But I do think the fact that so many
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.300]   people are more comfortable with the risk these days probably does open us up to the fact of we
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:23.860]   could just have more mini booms and busts and people might just have to get comfortable with this much
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:28.820]   faster volatility hitting the markets on a regular basis. We talked a lot about these mindset shifts.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:33.940]   You've written a lot about demographic changes and how much does that change the investment landscape
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:39.140]   going forward? We've never had a generation as large and as wealthy as the baby boomers that
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.020]   are going to live for as long as they do. So I think they're going to screw up a lot of
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.700]   historical relationships in the years ahead. I think that part of it is going to be
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:51.060]   going to be bizarre. But then they have the offsetting millennials, right, that are just as
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:57.220]   big as they are. We're getting into middle age these days, right? So that shift, I think,
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:02.900]   is interesting. I've just been having talked with people that I think the need for financial advice
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:07.860]   in the years ahead is going to be greater than anything we've ever seen. Because again, you have
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:12.180]   all these people who did the DIY thing and saved and invested and they did just fine on their own.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:18.660]   And then they realize in retirement, okay, now I'm really on my own. I'm in the water with no life raft.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:24.020]   I don't have any income coming in anymore. I'm just living on this portfolio. I have to think about taxes
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:28.900]   and withdrawal rates and what happens to my family in estate planning. And God forbid,
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.260]   something should happen to me. I'm the one who's been dealing with the finances.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.300]   What happens to my spouse or my kids if something should happen to me? And so
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.540]   I think the need for financial advice is going to be greater than ever in the years ahead.
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:44.340]   And I also wonder how much of that burden is going to fall on financial advisors and how much
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.620]   AI is going to pick up the slack. A lot of the conversations we've been having lately is
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:53.060]   are people going to trust these LLMs to be their financial advisor in the years ahead?
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:58.020]   I was just talking with a business coach. Like is the future of coaching? Is the future of therapy?
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:04.580]   These roles where it's a person with a lot of knowledge that can talk to you. And you know,
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:08.660]   I always told people that when I was doing financial planning, like a big component of it
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:14.100]   is about the conversation. It's not always just, you know, the numbers and the advice.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:19.620]   I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it will certainly be amazing for
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:25.620]   people who otherwise wouldn't have the assets to qualify for a human to spend time with them.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.900]   Like they now have the ability to have conversations about their money.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.060]   It's already starting, but it'll probably get so much better in a few years of like
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:37.700]   that knowledge also includes their portfolio, their savings rates, all those kinds of things.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:42.340]   It's going to be an interesting time for advice across all aspects of our life.
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:47.380]   Yes. My thinking is, especially if it just becomes a commodity where everyone has access to it,
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.740]   I think wealthy people are still going to go, well, I'm not going to do the same thing that
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.940]   everyone else is doing. There's certain wealthy people will be able to build their own model and
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:59.140]   have their personal, you know, AI financial advisor. But I think most wealthy people are going to go,
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.420]   I'm not going to trust a robot. I still need a person there with their hands in a steering wheel.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.740]   And again, like you said, someone with, with empathy and can, and I trust and I have faith in them.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:11.460]   But for the people on the lower end of the spectrum, who maybe didn't meet wealth management
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:15.460]   minimums in these things, and maybe you've gone to robo advisors and that sort of thing in the past,
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:19.620]   or just target date funds. I do think that the advice for them is going to open up is going to be
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:24.260]   wonderful. And I think that it's just going to help that behavior even more. And like you said,
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:28.260]   if you can upload your whole financial life into there and say like, what am I missing here?
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:33.540]   Because I get that question a lot from people like, Hey, I started saving. I got it all automated.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:38.020]   We're going to have a kid. Like, what's the next step? What should I be doing now? And I think if you
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:43.620]   have a, this LLM that can do that for you, I think it's going to be very helpful to a lot of people.
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:47.380]   Yeah. I mean, I've used it to walk through financial decisions and personal decisions now,
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:52.420]   even when it doesn't have all the data. But when you give it data, it's wild. We didn't talk at all
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:56.980]   about investment advice. At least my traditional strategy has always been low cost, passive,
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:02.580]   diversified index funds for actually the portfolio construction. Do you think that kind of advice
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:08.260]   changes? Or is that still where you think most people probably should be investing?
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:15.060]   It's funny. When I first started blogging, this is back in 2013, I think. There was still kind of an
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:21.380]   active versus passive debate. And there was a lot of writing on it. And I almost think that that debate is
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:28.660]   just dead now. Because I think the numbers have gotten so bad that if you look at the historical
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:36.020]   10, 15, 20 years, it's like 95% of professional money managers lose out to an index fund. And
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:40.820]   part of that maybe is just the environment because we've had these really big tech stocks that have
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:46.260]   carried the day. And it's really hard to beat if you have seven to 10 stocks that are carrying the
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:50.900]   weight for almost the entire stock market performance. But you'd hear for years, just wait until it's an
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:56.660]   active stock picker game, stock pickers market again. And that never really seems to happen.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:03.540]   And so I think that's another big leap forward for people is just they have realized that I was a
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:06.580]   sucker at the poker table. I'm not going to sit at this table anymore. I'm going to go this other
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:11.780]   table that's much easier and it's much cheaper and it's more tax efficient. And they still may pick
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:17.300]   stocks in their Robinhood account and have this side pocket or sidecar, right? Where I'm going to
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:21.460]   take 10 or 15% of my portfolio and I'm going to go nuts and I'm going to trade crypto and I'm going to
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.420]   buy and sell individual stocks. But the other stuff is on autopilot. And I do think for the vast
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:32.420]   majority of people, that is still the best way to do it. And I think the individual investor has just
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:38.420]   never had it better than they have it today. As low as costs are and zero dollar commissions and
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:43.780]   automation and all these things. I was having a conversation recently with someone about health and
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:49.220]   wealth and how the personal finance analogy has always been health and wealth are kind of similar
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:52.900]   because you know what you're supposed to do, but it's hard to actually follow through with that
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:59.220]   advice. But with health, you have to choose your meal every day, right? And you have to actually
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:04.260]   force yourself to eat right. And you have to force yourself to go to the gym. With your finances,
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:09.140]   you can automate a lot of good decisions ahead of time and really take yourself out of the equation.
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:14.260]   The fact that if you're willing to do the heavy lifting upfront and create those decisions and make
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:19.940]   all that automation part of it, it's never been easier to take your bad self out of the equation.
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:24.820]   This episode is brought to you by delete me. And if you prefer not to have your identity stolen or have
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:29.300]   your phone number, home address, or email showing up all over the internet, you really need to check
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:34.260]   out delete me this year. Unfortunately, there's hundreds of data brokers online that are constantly
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:39.540]   sharing and selling your personal info and keeping track of all of them is like playing whack-a-mole.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:43.700]   But fortunately, if you go to them one by one, you can get them to remove your data.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:49.860]   However, that process can take hours and hours to do yourself. I know I tried it two years ago and
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:55.140]   after spending more than 10 hours and not even getting close to finishing, I gave up and started
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:53:00.420]   using delete me and I haven't looked back. Since then I've signed up my entire family because delete
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:05.060]   me will not just find and remove your personal info from hundreds of data broker websites.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:10.980]   They'll continuously scan for new data that shows up, which sadly happens all the time and get that
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:16.900]   removed as well. On average, they find and remove over 2000 pieces of personal info for a customer
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:22.340]   in their first two years. And to date, they've done over a hundred million data removals for customers.
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:28.820]   So if you want your personal information removed from the web, go to chrishutchins.com/deleteme and get
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:35.300]   20% off a plan for you or your entire family. Again, that's chrishutchins.com/deleteme or click
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:39.460]   the link in the description. And when you talk about automation, the things that come to mind for me are
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:44.580]   just kind of like automated recurring deposits, robo-advisors. Are there other types of automation
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:45.380]   you're thinking of?
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:50.100]   So now, you know, tax loss harvesting, I think is one in the last 10 years that I think didn't really
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:54.260]   exist for a lot of individuals before. I think the biggest ones for most people are just the
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:59.460]   contributions, the rebalancing, the asset allocation, and just setting it and forgetting it. There's other
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.300]   stuff on the margins, I guess. But as long as you have those ones, you're doing better than the majority of
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:10.420]   the investing population. Yeah. Amazing how much I find people that really like to think about money
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.660]   actually don't think about their portfolio that much. I might spend a lot of time in spreadsheets.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:19.140]   I know you do too. Like we've got our charts and models, but I'm usually not thinking like,
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:25.140]   do I need to tweak my allocation to something? I'm thinking more, am I contributing enough?
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:29.300]   Should I be spending a different amount? Where is that spending going? How are the returns going?
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:33.860]   How is my 529 looking? And all that kind of stuff. So I'm in the investment committee for our wealth
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:38.740]   management firm. And we don't make allocation decisions for our clients based on we think rates
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:43.380]   are going to go higher or inflation is going to go lower. We're basing it off of risk and reward, right?
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:48.260]   Are rates high enough where you're being compensated for the risk you're taking? Or are rates too low
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:51.860]   and you're not being compensated? So don't take any risk there. Most of the decisions that we have
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:56.100]   with clients is not based on the market itself and the market changes, although sometimes it is,
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.020]   but it's more on life events. And do you have something going on in your life that would
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:04.420]   necessitate a change? Has your risk profile changed because you're retiring or because
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:08.500]   you're receiving an inheritance or because your kids are going to college or you have a wedding coming
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:15.540]   up? And it tends to be those life events that make it for an allocation change or change your saving
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.940]   habits or spending habits than the market itself.
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:22.820]   I wanted to try this new thing and you brought this up. So this idea of advice swapping on topics
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:28.500]   that have nothing to do with the core topic at hand. And so the question I had for you is you're
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:33.300]   further along than me in the parenting journey. When I read what you write and hear what you talk
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:38.980]   about, I feel as a kindred spirit to your attitude towards money and life and enjoying things in the
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:45.540]   moment, any advice for me being, you know, five to 10 years behind you in the, in the parenting
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:52.660]   life game? Yeah. Our oldest is 11. Now we have twins that are eight. Um, good luck with travel sports.
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:57.380]   That's one of them. This is something I did was not totally unprepared for. I grew up playing on school
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:03.540]   teams and, and rec leagues. And I never realized how professionalized sports are from a very young age.
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:10.580]   Now, uh, we have two girls who are in travel soccer and I can't believe how, you know, their sponsors
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:15.540]   involved and there's all these jerseys that you have to buy and it's traveling and it's every weekend
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:22.340]   and, and it's not cheap. So, uh, travel sports is certainly one of them. The interesting thing is,
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:27.060]   is that I, you know, people always say like, how do you teach your kids about money? I think at an early
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:32.180]   age, especially I've tried to bring up conversations. I think most of it is really just the actions that you
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:36.260]   have and not really what you're telling your kids. I think they're going to, they don't want to hear
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:40.420]   from you yet. Obviously they're going to maybe want to hear from you when they're older, but I think
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:46.820]   it's just really setting the right examples is what I've realized for a lot of different things for
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:50.740]   them. I try to bring my kids. I mean, they're, they're three and four, right? Like I'm trying to
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:55.220]   bring them along the journey of like, Hey, we're going to go drop these cans off at recycling.
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:58.500]   And then we make a little bit of money and then we can use that money to go buy a book,
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:03.220]   you know, like little, little drops of like how the world works around money.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.500]   But I'm certainly not trying to teach them as much as show them.
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.380]   And we've still been, we've trying to teach them with cash. And it's interesting,
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:15.220]   they get a lot of cash gifts for birthdays and holidays and such. And because we're really
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:20.340]   moving towards this cashless society where it's everything you buy it online or you tap a credit card
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:26.180]   or you pay with your phone. And so money to them, isn't going to mean as much as it did to us.
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:30.900]   And so I think having cash be part of the deal where they're saving and all my kids have piggy banks
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:37.780]   and still work with cash. And we try to help them save that money. It's, it's harder to have those
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:42.980]   conversations because money in a lot of ways is just out of sight, out of mind now. And it's so much
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:48.500]   easier to spend than it was. And I think that's a really difficult part of it is just teaching them.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:52.980]   Because when you had a lot of cash back in the day and you spent, you could literally see
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:57.300]   it getting smaller and you really felt it. And it's hard to feel those spending decisions anymore.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.820]   I've had times where we bought something, was there ice cream? And my wife will be like,
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:05.140]   how much was that? And I'm like, I don't know. It's on the screen, you tap your phone, you hit the,
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:10.820]   you know, tip button, and then you walk away. And it's like, it's so simple that there have been
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:14.740]   moments where I was like, I couldn't tell you whether it was 12 or $15. Maybe that's,
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.180]   that's good that I'm not thinking about the pennies in the sense, you know, but also
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:23.620]   I, it's not even in front of you. Like it would be if I had to count out the cash and get the change
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:27.060]   and all that. And on the travel sports thing, it's funny. Cause I think I've gotten emails
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:32.260]   from so many people on different ones. Like the first time I got an email, someone said, Hey,
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:36.980]   if you've never taken your daughter's ice skating, don't do it because my daughter is now a competitive
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:41.460]   ice skater. We travel all around the country. Do not let her touch the ice. And then I was like,
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:45.060]   Oh, okay. So no ice skating. And then the next one's like travel soccer. Okay. Don't let them
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:50.180]   touch a soccer ball. It's like, turns out that every sport seems to have been created in a competitive
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:55.060]   way. Uh, more than I remember as a kid, this is the life we live now. And yeah, I complain about,
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:59.460]   but it's also very fun. Like, um, my wife and I always say, like, what else would we be doing on
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:03.780]   the weekends anyway? You know, we, we have our summers open. There's no travel sports in the summer.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:07.860]   They do some camps and stuff, but honestly, it's very fun. And that's how you get new friends with
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:12.660]   the parents. And, um, I know people complain about it and it's fun to, you know, joke about
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:16.580]   it, but it is really fun. Okay. What, what, what was yours?
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:20.660]   Okay. So I listened to your podcast with Tim Ferriss, where you went into, you went into some
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:27.300]   like your very deep Jedi point stuff. And, um, the, the gold bar one killed me. I can't believe you're
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:31.620]   going to Costco and buying gold bars and you're buying a million dollars worth of, of gift cards on
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:35.700]   Amazon. And so I listened to Patrick O'Shaughnessy and invest like the best. And he has like the world's
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:39.220]   greatest venture capital investor on there or a really good stock picker. And he'll be like,
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:43.140]   his whole thing is like, this is who you're up against. And that's you for me with when it comes
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:47.860]   to points. Um, so I wanted to give you my point strategy and I wanted you to critique me a little
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:54.580]   bit because I, I would, I'm what I would consider a dabbler. I, I like to use the point system to my
[00:59:54.580 --> 01:00:00.420]   advantage. I think that I'm being compensated in some way, but I don't go nearly as deep as you,
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:08.340]   right. I'm very surface level. And so I'd say every 24 months or so I will get a new card because
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:12.900]   I want to get the bonus for it. I know we're going to be spending money on a vacation or my wife wants
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:17.060]   new furniture and we're going to be spending enough to hit the limit. And so I'll just do it all in one
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:23.540]   fell swoop and we'll get the a hundred thousand point bonus or 60,000 point bonus. But I think that
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:29.940]   the inflation has been so high in these where you don't get as much bang for the buck that I used to
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:34.020]   save all my points. And I was interesting listening to Tim Ferriss talk about he's got like 15 million
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:38.420]   points. I was wondering how much has been inflated away by the value that he could have gotten if he
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:44.820]   would have just spent them along the way, because my strategy now is every month I get them, I take it out
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:51.060]   and I do it. I just get it in cash. I don't wait. I don't save it for anything else besides my airline
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:57.780]   miles for my main credit cards. I just take the cash every month because I feel like the points aren't
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:02.740]   worth what they used to be. If you had to back the envelope, what would the inflation rate be on points
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:07.220]   for the last 10 years? It's pretty high, right? I would say it's been pretty high. I remember one
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:12.980]   specific moment, which was my wife and I did our honeymoon to the Seychelles in business class.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:20.980]   And I seem to remember somewhere around like 120,000 points round trip. And now that trip would be like
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:25.460]   200,000 points or something like I'm going to get the numbers wrong. I could probably go back and look at
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:30.580]   them. But I would say there are a lot of things that in the last 10 years cost twice as much to do,
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:36.340]   which is a meaningful change. Now, how much has travel costs? Like, is that flight twice as much
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:44.820]   now? I haven't done that math either. Maybe I should. I think we're in an interesting place today in 2025,
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:50.340]   because I can't remember it was what branch of government investigated a couple airlines and said,
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:55.060]   hey, you guys are devaluing your points. We're going to do an investigation. So I think that probably for
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:02:02.180]   the next one to three years, you probably won't see point devaluation for US airlines, just because
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:07.140]   there's like an investigation into these airlines for this practice. And if they were going to do it,
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:12.180]   this would not be the ideal time to do it in the middle of this whole thing. Now, international airlines,
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:19.620]   different story. I think that the difference in value, there's kind of, let's put it at like three
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:25.060]   tiers. There's the like, I am only going to redeem my points at these like incredible values. But it
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:31.140]   means that I either have to travel in a way that maybe isn't how I want or wait a really long time.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:36.100]   And I'm like, I like doing that. Not everyone does. I wouldn't encourage anyone to do that.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:41.940]   I think the taking your points and using them for travel, right? Like if you have a chase FI reserve,
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.820]   you can use it to buy flights and hotels in the portal at one and a half cents. I think doing that
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:52.020]   is probably a good way to cash out your points. That's better than taking the statement credit at
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:57.140]   one cent or something like that. My thing that I think I told Tim was you've got these points.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:03.780]   Anytime you're traveling, I would go see there's so many tools that do this now award tool points.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.700]   Yeah. Is there a way I can get more than one and a half cents booking the trip that I want?
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:12.740]   No, let's use the one and a half cents. That's the like, I just want to get the easy solution
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:17.940]   that gives me good return. And if you're getting one and a half or more cents on a card, that's earning
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:22.660]   three X points on travel and dining. You know, you're getting four and a half percent back.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:30.260]   That's pretty competitive with cash back. That said, I think there's a good argument the other way,
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.220]   which is like out of sight, out of mind, get cash back.
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.540]   It's like the simple strategy. That's where I've landed. It's like the indexing of points.
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:42.180]   And so I would say if you don't want to play the signup bonus, welcome bonus game,
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.500]   Coinbase just announced this card. That's like, okay, if you hold some Bitcoin at Coinbase,
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:50.420]   and they didn't say how much, I don't think it's just another 4% card, right? The Smart League card
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:56.980]   was 4%. Before it got retired, the US bank altitude reserve was effectively like a four and a half
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:03.460]   percent on travel and mobile wallet, which is like a lot of our purchases. Now, if you can afford to move
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:10.180]   $100,000 into a brokerage or bank account at Bank of America, like you can get three and a half
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:17.140]   percent back on travel and dining and 2.6 to 5% back on everything. And if you use those points
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:23.700]   to book travel, you add 25% boost. So now you're looking at like, I think it's like 3.2 on everything,
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:31.140]   4.4 on travel and dining. It's a pretty compelling alternative to points. If you're not willing to
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:37.700]   dabble in this other thing, if you are right, like, then I'm typically having points be worth
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:43.300]   3 to 6 cents, and it blows everything out of the water. And so if my points are going to be worth
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:48.260]   three times more, right? If points are worth 5 cents, I'm getting 3x, that's 15% back. That's way,
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:53.220]   way better. And I think I've worked that muscle to a point that it doesn't feel like a lot of stress,
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:59.380]   because I know, hey, we're going to have something booked. It's going to all work out. I'm comfortable
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:02.820]   saying we were going to go to Europe in summer. We don't know which weeks, and I just know something
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:07.460]   will pop up and we'll make it work. I'm going to wait for my AI assistant to do this all for me,
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:12.020]   I think. You know, I have one more question for you. After listening to the Tim Ferriss podcast,
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:17.940]   how much of this is a game to you versus how much you care about the monetary benefits? Because a lot
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:22.980]   of it, I feel like, for me, like following the markets, I don't really buy and sell individual
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:26.580]   stocks that much. I just love following the markets because I think it's so interesting.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:31.460]   Is that the points game for you as well? Yeah. I get a lot of dopamine out of it. It's fun.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:38.340]   And I've created a content place to talk about that thing. And so I think the only two things I'll say
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:44.900]   that put a stronger push in both directions. So one, points are always on sale. And so if you have cash
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:51.300]   back, you can still go to those same tools and be like, "Hey, is there some world where I want a flight
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:55.780]   that's three grand, but I can book it for the points equivalent of $500?" And like,
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:01.940]   you could just maybe go buy that, those points for $700. Even if you bought them for $1,000,
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:07.380]   you know, it's such a good deal. So you can play the cashback game and get the arbitrage that you get
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:11.620]   from points being able to have outsized value, even without having them because you just go buy them.
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:18.100]   The other side is what you said. Every 24 months, you open up a card. The average return of a top 20
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:23.940]   signup bonus, meaning like pick the 20 best welcome offers right now is about 16.7%.
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:30.100]   So you are better off always working on your welcome bonus than doing anything else, cashback
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:37.140]   points. Even if you use those points in the worst way, I think that you would probably have no negative,
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:41.940]   if not a positive impact on your credit score of you and your partner or your wife or your husband,
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:46.020]   whoever's listening, opening up a card every quarter instead of every two years.
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:46.580]   And so like,
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:50.980]   people find that overhead really stressful. And I laugh because they're like, "Oh,
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:53.860]   it's so stressful to open up a card every quarter." And I'm like, "Okay."
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:59.780]   But if you actually look at the difference between getting 16% back in like four, like it's pretty
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:05.300]   meaningful. And that's what I do. And I just keep one or two automatic payments on those cards to keep
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:09.860]   them open because it, like you said, it's part of your credit. So that would be my advice is like,
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:15.460]   whenever you see a bonus, why not go for it? Otherwise, for your personality, it's like you can
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:21.220]   almost just shift all to a high cashback card. And maybe there's categories where you're like, "Well,
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:26.660]   I've got a 5X flights card, a 3X travel card." Great. Get the points. Like, great deal. But I would
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.660]   hang on to them. And if you're booking a family trip, use one of these easy tools and be like,
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:34.820]   "Is there an amazing way to get a great deal here?" Or maybe you're like, "We don't really
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:40.580]   care where we go. We want to go on a fun spring break." Great. Go to this pointy daydream explorer.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:46.340]   Where in the world can we go for an incredible experience?" But I don't know. That's my advice.
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:49.540]   I wasn't aware of those websites either. So I will be bookmarking those now too.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:53.860]   Yeah. They make it so easy. That's the joy of the points game for someone who doesn't
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:58.420]   want to go down the rabbit hole is it's never been easier to have something like Google Flights.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:04.900]   In fact, go download the PointsPath extension and it'll just layer on points deals to Google Flights.
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.780]   Oh, wow. Okay.
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.980]   It's like, I'm searching for a flight and it's like, "Aero, use your points."
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.980]   See, bring it all full circle. It's never been better to be an individual investor or a points person.
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.780]   Yeah. Yeah. It's never been better to be alive.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.060]   That's right.
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:22.420]   All right. This has been great. I really appreciate you joining. Until the next time.
