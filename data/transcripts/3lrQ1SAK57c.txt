[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.240]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 6, reading verses 10 to 13.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.120]   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.040]   Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.320]   devil.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.520]   For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.400]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   places.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.680]   Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.880]   evil day, and having done all, to stand."
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.560]   Now there, as we all realize, we've got two main exhortations.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.280]   The first is to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.080]   The second is to take unto us and to put on the whole armor of God.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.760]   Now we are at the moment looking at this first exhortation.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.720]   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might."
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.440]   We have considered why this is essential, absolutely essential, and how we are completely
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.520]   lost and defeated and undone without it.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.200]   And therefore, we've been spending some time in discovering exactly what it means to be
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.580]   strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, and we've taken it in this way.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.320]   We have been at pains to show that it doesn't teach or inculcate any kind of doctrine of
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.080]   passivity, that we do nothing, just hand it over to the Lord.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.280]   We've adduced many reasons for rejecting that teaching as being finally unscriptural.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.040]   And we have rather seen that what this means is that we are to exert ourselves with all
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.520]   our might and may, but realize even as we do so that that is totally insufficient, that
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:17.360]   we must be strengthened with his almighty power as we do everything we can in this way.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.400]   In other words, the doctrine is that in the rebirth we are given a new principle of life,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.600]   and in that life there is inherently and of necessity power and strength.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.160]   You can't have life without having power, without having strength.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.440]   At first, of course, it's very small, it's very incomplete.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.760]   The infant, the child, while it has strength, has very little strength.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.760]   So that needs to be developed and faster.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.360]   That's what the apostle is teaching here.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.240]   He's telling us to develop it, to do everything we can, to increase it.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.400]   And in addition to that, he has reminded us that there is ever always this great promise
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.680]   that the Lord himself will be with us.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.120]   All the strength we have comes from him.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.040]   We are united to him.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.820]   We are members of the body, he is the head, and all the nutriment and strength and power
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.000]   comes down from him.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.880]   Very well then, so that in addition to doing all we can to develop our own power, the power
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.320]   that is now given to us, it's only ours in the sense that it's now in us, it is the possession
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.920]   of the Christian.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.680]   It's not our own natural power, it is this new spiritual life and power.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.560]   In addition to remembering all that, we must, I say, remember the power of his name.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.400]   We must invoke it.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.760]   And then we went on last Sunday morning to show this.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.160]   That over and above all this, we are promised that in times of stress and unusual difficulty
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.840]   and strain, we shall also be made conscious of the fact that he is with us, that he is
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.040]   at hand, that he is helping us and strengthening us and enabling us and guarding us and shielding
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   us.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.040]   Therefore, we came to this conclusion, that relying on all this, we should immediately
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.240]   therefore proceed to enter the battle and the fight, to go on with the Christian life
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.400]   without fear and without any hesitation.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.960]   Now that's the point at which we've arrived.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.440]   And therefore we come this morning to the practical application of all this.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.960]   How does all this really work in practice?
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.360]   Now we've had it again in that hymn by John Newton which we've just been singing.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.440]   You notice how he puts it, "Though many foes beset your road and feeble is your arm, your
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.800]   life is hid with Christ in God beyond the reach of harm.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.200]   Weak as you are, you shall not faint, or fainting shall not die.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.000]   Jesus, the strength of every saint, will aid you from on high."
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.160]   Here it is, it's a perfect statement of the doctrine we've been elaborating.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:19.040]   He says, "Though unperceived by mortal sense, faith sees him ever near, a guide, a glory,
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.720]   a defence.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.840]   Then what have you to fear?"
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   That's it.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.520]   That's what I say, we should proceed without fear or hesitation.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.200]   And that's what John Newton is saying.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:38.120]   "As surely," he says, "as he overcame and triumphed once for you, so surely you that
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.480]   love his name shall in him triumph too."
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.120]   Now then, I say this is all right, here's the doctrine, here's the teaching.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.480]   We've seen it out of the scripture.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.600]   Here's a very good summary of it in this hymn by John Newton.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.080]   But someone may say, "Well now, how am I to know all this in practice?
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.640]   How am I to live in that kind of way?"
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.920]   Well now then, I want to try and sum it up this morning.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.480]   Let me try and put it in a very practical form to you.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.080]   The first thing we must bear in mind and keep on holding it in mind is the two elements
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.880]   that I've been emphasizing right through.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.360]   His strength, but our activity.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.760]   Now the two things are absolutely essential.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.280]   John Newton doesn't say here that he's going to do it all for us, that he'll triumph for
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.280]   us.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.440]   No, what he says is this, "As surely as he overcame and triumphed once for you."
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.800]   That's what he did in his death.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.900]   We can do nothing about our justification.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.720]   We take no part in justification or in regeneration.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   We can't.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.920]   We are dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.440]   We are altogether without strength.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.400]   That is entirely his work and it is done for us.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   And we but receive it.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.720]   Now but when you come to this other matter of sanctification and fighting the Christian
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.360]   life, it's no longer that.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.840]   Because now we've been given new life and strength and power.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.920]   Now then, "As surely as he overcame and triumphed once for you."
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:21.200]   So surely you, you that love his name, shall in him triumph too.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.520]   You are going to triumph.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.480]   But you're going to triumph, he says, because you are in him.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.680]   And because you've got this life from him and because you're united to him and because
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.960]   though unperceived by mortal sense, faith sees him always near.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.160]   Very well.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.200]   But we must hold on to these two elements.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.160]   The strength and the power that he gives us and our activity in the might and the strength
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.160]   of that power.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.960]   In other words, I say again, we don't hand it all over to the Lord and do nothing.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.880]   There is this essential difference between justification and sanctification.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.060]   Justification is taken entirely by faith.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.760]   Sanctification is something that we work out by faith, through faith, in the faith which
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.080]   we now have and in our relationship to him and in the possession of the life that he
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.520]   has given us.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.640]   Now, this is, I say, the fundamental doctrine.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.080]   And so many are confused because of it.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.680]   The two aspects, the two activities must ever be borne in mind.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:36.360]   Let me summarize that and sum it up by reminding you again of another wonderful statement of
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.440]   this very doctrine which you find there at the very beginning of the book of Revelation.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.840]   You remember that in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation, you've got seven
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   letters written to seven churches.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:58.080]   And in the seven letters, you have the same statement, and it's this, "To him that
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.080]   overcometh."
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.720]   Now, there are certain promises made to those who overcome.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.760]   In the case of the first church, it is this, "To him that overcometh will I give to
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:14.840]   eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God."
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:21.240]   Read these seven letters at your leisure and you will notice that it's exactly the same
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.880]   in the seven, "To him that overcometh."
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:30.040]   Let me give you the last one, to the church of the Laodiceans, chapter 3, 21, "To him
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.040]   that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame and
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.720]   am set down with my Father in his throne."
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:43.760]   Now, you notice the teaching is that we are the ones who've got to overcome.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.820]   It isn't all done for us.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.840]   We don't just rest in faith, as it were, and look on as he gains the victory for us.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.680]   No, the exhortation is that we do certain things.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.960]   We've got to repent, we've got to get back our first love, we've got to do the first
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.460]   works again, and we've got to watch, we've got to be observant, and so on.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:09.360]   We are the ones who are to overcome, but we are given the unction, the anointing, the
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.320]   eye salve, the gold, the raiment, everything that we need.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.280]   We are given the possibility of doing it, but we've got to do it.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.600]   It is our activity.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.720]   Now then, there I say in the last book of the Bible is that wonderful summing up in
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   the letters of the risen Lord to his churches, there is a wonderful summing up of this whole
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.720]   doctrine.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.320]   Well, now then, here is the practical matter.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.520]   How do I apply all this?
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.600]   How do I really translate all this into daily life and living and practice?
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.680]   Well, it comes to this.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.160]   We've got to believe all this teaching.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.280]   We've got to believe all the teaching that we've considered about the need of the food
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.560]   and the drink, the need of prayer and of communion with him.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:07.160]   We've got to realize the all-importance of realizing our condition in him.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.040]   We've got to have assurance of salvation.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.080]   It's hopeless if we haven't.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.200]   We've got to be certain as to who we are, that we are the children of God, and we've
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.440]   got to believe all these exceeding great and precious promises.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.440]   That's the first thing.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.240]   It's no use going on unless we are clear about all these.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.240]   What then?
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:35.640]   Well, then I say we've got to go on reminding ourselves of them, and particularly perhaps
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:42.160]   those last aspects of the truth we've been considering the last few Sundays.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:49.200]   The realization of his grace, the realization of his nearness and of his presence.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:55.760]   We've got to practice this, the practice, if you like, of the presence of the Lord.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.760]   And it takes time.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.560]   It takes—it means practice.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.260]   Any teaching which gives you the impression that you can suddenly get all this in a meeting
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.840]   is entirely opposed to the New Testament, which keeps on telling you to go on with these
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.720]   things, to continue with them, to give diligence.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.480]   These are the terms you remember.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.880]   We've considered them, these military terms that are used in the exhortations.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.560]   They all carry this notion of having to go on with it.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.040]   You don't receive this as some kind of second blessing in a meeting.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.840]   There's no such teaching anywhere in the Bible.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.200]   All the teaching is rather with this continuing.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:40.680]   So we go on practicing the presence of the Lord, seeking his face, seeking a realization
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:46.960]   of his nearness, seeking the manifestations of the Son of God.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:54.400]   There's a hymn which tells us to take time to be holy, and it takes time to be holy.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   We don't like that, of course.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   That's why we like the shortcuts.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.720]   That's why the cultic teachings are always popular.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.480]   That's why any teaching that seems to offer it to us in a formula and says, "Everybody's
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.520]   been wrong throughout the centuries," here it is.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   This is all you do.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   Quite simple.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.360]   No, no, take time to be holy.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.040]   And it does take time to put these things into practice.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:20.760]   Or take again a scriptural exhortation, "Grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord."
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   Grow.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.120]   And growth takes time.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.440]   Don't suddenly jump up, but you go on almost imperceptibly.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.560]   But you grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.440]   Then as we do this, that will create confidence.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.760]   There's no question about this.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:44.280]   "Unto him that hath shall be given, and he shall have more abundance."
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.000]   There's no question about this.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.800]   The more we know, the more certain we become.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   Every experience we get of his grace, his nearness, his presence, makes us stronger.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.160]   We're in a better position than we were, and we go on from week to week and month to
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:07.240]   month and year to year, growing in confidence and in assurance and in an understanding of
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   these things.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.600]   And as we go on, we shall be able to agree more and more with John Newton that we've
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.520]   got nothing to fear, nothing at all to fear.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.080]   We shall even be able to say, "Resist the devil and he will flee from you."
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.760]   Very well.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:34.920]   Now then, that is something that has to go on constantly, perpetually.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.800]   But there is always the difficulty of the beginning, and this is where many tend to
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.640]   stumble.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.760]   And all I've got to say about the beginning is this, that there is only one way to know
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:55.120]   these things, and that is to try them, to practice them, to make a beginning.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.680]   We've got to act in our faith.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.960]   It's no use reading the doctrine and understanding the teaching if we do nothing about it.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.280]   We've got to translate it into practice.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.360]   There is always an element of venture in faith.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:13.560]   Faith is entirely different from a mere intellectual assent and belief.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.720]   Faith is always the putting of the thing into practice and into operation.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:26.560]   I'm tempted to repeat the story that has been told in order to illustrate that, of
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:32.480]   the men who were standing on one side of the Niagara Falls.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.520]   And there was a man, one of these men, who could walk over on a rope.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.760]   And not only could he walk over on a rope, he could wheel a wheelbarrow over on the rope
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.560]   across the Niagara.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.840]   And he turned to a man standing by, he said, "Do you believe that I could not only wheel
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.120]   a wheelbarrow over that rope to the other side, do you believe that I could also wheel
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.520]   it with a man sitting inside?"
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.440]   "Yes, I do," said the man.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.720]   "Well," he said, "step inside."
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.720]   The man wouldn't.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:05.320]   Very well, there's the difference between intellectual assent and faith.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.240]   Faith gets into the wheelbarrow.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.600]   It believes it to such an extent that it begins to practice it.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.200]   Now this is, I say, a fundamental principle with regard to faith.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.760]   There was a very good expression of it in that 34th Psalm, which we read at the beginning
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.880]   this morning.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.480]   And I read it in order to remind you of this principle.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:36.360]   Here's a man, you see, who's had an experience of the goodness and of the grace of God.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.860]   And he wants everybody else to share it.
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.800]   Any man who has such an experience always wants everybody else to have it.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:50.200]   He says, "I want you to rejoice with me and to tell forth his praise together."
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.760]   But there were certain people who couldn't do that.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.480]   They couldn't join in.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.600]   So the man begins to appeal to them, and this is his appeal.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:04.200]   "Oh, taste," he says, "taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.920]   But you'll never see it until you've tasted."
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.800]   He says, "The trouble is you people are standing there and you've got your theoretical difficulties."
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.940]   You say, "Now this sounds very wonderful, but it sounds too good to be true."
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.960]   And he says, "You'll remain there standing and you'll be without this knowledge and without
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.640]   this blessing until you actually do something about it."
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.100]   "Taste, and then you will see, but you'll never see until you taste."
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.340]   Now this is so true in the whole of the Christian life.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.140]   People will persist in standing back and looking on and saying, "How can I?
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.140]   Is it true?
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.140]   Is it really?
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.880]   I know it's happened to other people, but can this happen to me?"
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.820]   And this is the hesitation.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:46.620]   Now I believe this is the very thing that the apostle had in his mind as he was writing
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.320]   these words, "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might."
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.700]   So many of these early Christians were fearful, timorous, hesitant, people like Timothy and
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:02.140]   others, and always they're being exalted to venture out, to trust, to try, to taste, and
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.340]   then they will see.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:10.020]   So we mustn't stand by just saying, "How can I?
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.380]   The thing seems too much.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.700]   It's too good to be true.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.460]   The promises are so glorious."
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.380]   Here he's telling us that we are up against the wiles of the devil, that we are wrestling
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.460]   not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities and the powers and the rulers
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.420]   of the darkness of this world and so on.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:31.140]   And yet he tells us, "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might."
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.900]   But we are timorous mortals and we tend to faint and to feel weak, and we say, "It's
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.900]   too much.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.900]   It's impossible.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.900]   I can't do it."
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.420]   Certain exceptions of people can, but how can I?
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:46.500]   Well, now the answer is that we've got to apply this central principle in connection
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.500]   with faith.
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:54.300]   There is this element of venture, and in a very wonderful way, we will discover this.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.420]   Let me put it as a principle.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.860]   How can I be enabled to live this sort of life?
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:09.460]   Well, the answer is that the enabling is in the command itself.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.340]   Now that to me is the whole secret.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.420]   Be strong.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.940]   How can I be strong?
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.900]   You can be strong by obeying the command to be strong.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.620]   Now let me expand that a little by giving you some illustrations to try to show what
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.580]   I mean.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:34.460]   I say that the enabling, the power to do these things, is rarely implicit in and contained
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.580]   in the command to do it.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.100]   Go back to an Old Testament illustration to start with.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:49.020]   There is Moses leading those grumbling, recalcitrant children of Israel.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.060]   They come to him one day and they say, "There's no water here.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.700]   Have you brought us out to Egypt in order that we may die of thirst?
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.940]   Here in this wilderness there's no water.
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.380]   Everything's as dry as a bone.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.380]   What can we do?"
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.700]   And do you remember what happened?
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:12.060]   God told Moses to strike a rock.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.700]   A rock, remember.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.900]   A hard rock.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.060]   He told him to strike it.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.140]   And that if he struck it, that water would come pouring out of it.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.380]   Now there's the predicament, isn't there?
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.860]   Moses is a man, and though he's a very good man, he knows perfectly well that if he but
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.660]   strikes rocks, nothing will happen.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.380]   He may have struck many a rock, but no water would come gushing out.
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:43.500]   But here he's told that if he strikes that rock with his rod, that water will come gushing
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.500]   out of it.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.580]   Now there is the whole predicament of faith.
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.300]   That's exactly the position of all of us as we stand face to face with this.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.220]   Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.220]   But who am I, you say?
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.220]   I'm just a weakling.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.220]   How can...
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.620]   What's the use of telling me to be strong?
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.540]   Now then, the answer is this, you see.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:08.540]   Moses, in faith, took his rod and he smote, he struck the rock.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:13.300]   And out of it came the water gushing forth.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:18.980]   It wasn't Moses' power, but it was Moses' arm, and it was Moses' rod.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.980]   Moses didn't just stand by and see the water gushing out.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.980]   No, no.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:28.380]   Moses had to lift up his arm and he had to strike, he had to smite that rock.
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.420]   But as he did so, the power was given to him.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.380]   And the water came rushing out of the rock.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:41.120]   Now there, I think, you see the two elements in this matter.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.380]   You see the activity of the man, but you see that the power is the power given to him by
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.380]   God.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.380]   It wasn't Moses.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.820]   Moses hadn't got power to do things like that.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.820]   But Moses was given the power to do that.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.460]   The two things come together.
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.980]   But the point I'm particularly emphasizing now is this.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.420]   That Moses, if he'd but hesitated there and had done nothing, would not have seen this
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.900]   marvelous miracle.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.240]   But by acting, he discovered that the power was given.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.020]   He tasted and he saw.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.700]   That is the way in which it happens.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.640]   But let me give you another illustration.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.260]   Take it from the New Testament.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:24.060]   There is a case recorded, I think, in three of the Gospels, the case of the men with a
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.700]   withered hand.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.780]   You remember our Lord encountered that man on a Sunday.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:37.060]   You'll find the account, for instance, in Matthew 12, verses 9 to 14.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.380]   And there our Lord is confronted by this man and obviously has the intention of healing
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.340]   him.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:48.180]   The Pharisees saw that and they began an argument with our Lord as to whether it was right to
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.780]   heal a man on the Sunday.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.500]   That's not the material point.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:56.460]   The material point is this, that our Lord, having answered the Pharisees and their foolish
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:04.580]   objections, I read in verse 13, "And he, our Lord, saith to the men, Stretch forth
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.580]   thine hand."
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.900]   Now here again is the predicament.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.900]   Here is a man with a withered hand, paralyzed.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.580]   Perhaps it had never developed at all.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.900]   The point is that it was a useless hand.
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.700]   He could do nothing at all with it.
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:24.660]   And partly because of the disuse and the lack of development, the muscles were flexed and
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.500]   flabby and feeble and had no power and strength in them.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.620]   Here's a man who can't use his hand.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.620]   It's withered.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.660]   Yet our Lord says to that man, "Stretch forth thine hand."
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:45.060]   And what I read is, "And he stretched it forth, and it was restored whole like as to the other."
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.580]   Now here is the whole marvel of this matter.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.500]   Here's a man who can't do anything at all with his hand.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.940]   Our Lord says to him, "Stretch forth thine hand."
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.380]   Well, but he can't do it.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.380]   The man is paralyzed.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.380]   The hand is withered.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.740]   Nevertheless, at the command of our Lord, though he knew perfectly well he couldn't
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.900]   do it, the man did it.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.440]   And he stretched it forth.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.620]   And it was restored whole like as the other.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.300]   Now you see the elements are all here again.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.860]   The man had to make the effort.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:23.500]   What happened here was not that the man said, "Well, yes, my hand is withered, but I believe
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:29.140]   that all things are possible with you and that you can heal my hand and restore it.
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.620]   I believe that you can do it."
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.220]   And as he expressed his faith, suddenly his hand sprang forward.
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.740]   It isn't that.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.740]   It isn't that.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.660]   The man didn't suddenly find his hand jerking up and stretching forth.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.780]   It wasn't done for him.
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.540]   No, this is the interesting thing.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.740]   Our Lord says to the man who can't do it, "Stretch forth thine hand."
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.460]   And as he spoke, the power was given to the man.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.460]   So when he made the effort, to his own amazement and astonishment, for the first time he found
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.880]   that he could stretch forth his hand.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.860]   You see the two things are absolutely necessary.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:09.100]   And as you go through the miracles, you will find that in most of them, these elements
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:14.220]   are always present, apart from the nature of miracles.
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.420]   Our Lord always calls upon somebody to do something.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.700]   The woman that was doubled up and bent, "Straighten up!"
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.620]   Immediately she straightened.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.060]   And so with all the others.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.060]   The lame, the parrot, "Take up thy bed and walk."
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.260]   The thing sounds monstrous.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.260]   The man hasn't got the power.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.500]   Yes, but the power is given in the command.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.420]   And as he makes his effort, he suddenly finds he can do it.
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.740]   Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.780]   You will never know this until you're practicing it.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:46.740]   But come, there is a yet better illustration, it seems to me, which brings out still further
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.740]   elements.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.740]   Now I hope that we're all clear as to what I'm doing.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.460]   I am not using the miracles in order to teach sanctification.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.660]   I think that's always a fallacy.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:06.540]   What I am doing is to show you how the power to do is given to us in the commandment.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:11.060]   So we come to the famous case of Peter.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.380]   Peter walking upon the water.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:19.740]   There it is in the 14th chapter of Matthew's Gospel.
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:24.380]   You remember here were these disciples on their own and the sea had become viceless.
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.460]   There was a storm.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.260]   Suddenly our Lord comes walking on the water.
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:33.260]   They thought at first it was a ghost, but at last he told them who he was and they recognized
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.260]   him.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.260]   And then Peter did a very characteristic thing.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.340]   He was impressed by our Lord's power to walk on the water.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.900]   He said, "Command me to walk on the water."
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.300]   Is it possible for me also to do this thing?
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.860]   And our Lord said, "Yes, it is."
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.500]   And he said, "Come."
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:58.820]   And then I read, "And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.140]   to go to Jesus."
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.340]   Notice what we are told.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:08.220]   Then we are told that Peter, beginning to see the waves by stress near him, began to
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:14.300]   be afraid and as a result of that he began to sink.
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:20.140]   Then comes the word, "And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him, and
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.580]   then he rebuked him.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.020]   Why didst thou doubt, O thou of little faith?"
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:30.060]   Now then, here you see the elements.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.020]   Peter has to make the move.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:38.060]   He has to, when Peter was come down out of the ship, the thing isn't done to Peter
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.060]   or for Peter.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:44.220]   Peter, now, who had never walked on the waves in his life before, believing this word, gets
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:50.020]   out of the boat and begins to put his feet onto the waves, and he begins to walk on the
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.740]   waves.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.220]   You see, his effort.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.780]   He has to make his effort, but he's given the power to do it.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.380]   Then when he doubts, of course, he loses the power and down he goes.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.300]   But our Lord lays hold upon him.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:09.700]   Now there I think is the perfect illustration, showing what we've been trying to say, that
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.140]   we are given the power, that this is a part of the working of God's grace.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:19.540]   Yes, but in moments of exceptional difficulty and stress, when the battle is unusually hot
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:24.980]   and strong and powerful and the devil brings out all his forces, the Lord appears and lays
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.980]   hold upon us.
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.500]   We are not allowed to sink.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.180]   Now, you see the two elements are there.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.900]   If Peter had continued, there would have been no need for the Lord to take hold of him,
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.700]   and as it were, to take the thing out of his hands and deliver him.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.620]   He could have gone on walking on the waves.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:47.220]   But the emphasis is again upon our effort, our activity.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.500]   Peter would never have known that it was possible for him to walk upon the waves if he hadn't
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:55.460]   got out of the boat, if he hadn't made the effort, if he hadn't done all that he could,
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:00.460]   but of course relying upon the power of the Lord to enable him to do it.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.740]   Well now, there are the examples, but let's go on.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.780]   Look at the various miracles performed by these same apostles in the book of the Acts
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.220]   of the Apostles.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.580]   How did they do them?
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.380]   There are some very interesting observations we can make about these miracles.
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:25.380]   One is that you notice that there was never a failure in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.540]   Another thing you notice is that these apostles did not work miracles every day.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.540]   They never made preliminary announcements that they were going to do so.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.700]   Never.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.500]   That's where they differ from so many people who claim to be working miracles today.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.700]   They can announce they're going to do it on such and such a day.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.500]   The apostles never did that, and I think the reason is obvious.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.900]   They never knew when they were going to do it.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.740]   They had no idea when they were going to do it.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.500]   Well then you say, "Well, how did they do it when they did it?"
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.080]   And the answer is again.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.900]   They were given the commission.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.420]   They were given the power.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.220]   So Peter and John, seeing the men sitting at the beautiful gate of the temple, Peter
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.820]   knew he'd got the commission.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.820]   So he says, "In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk."
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.820]   And the men rose immediately.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:15.380]   His feet and his ankle bones received strength, and he leapt up and went walking and leaping
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.420]   and praising God into the temple.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.420]   But here is the thing.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.640]   With the commission is given the power.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.780]   In the command there is the enabling.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.900]   There's the teaching everywhere, and it applies to all those miracles.
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:35.420]   Well, let me put it to you like this, because I think this perhaps helps to put it in a
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.700]   yet more practical manner.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.980]   Take this whole question of preaching.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.700]   People have held some very strange, odd views with regard to preaching.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.980]   I've actually known men in my own experience who didn't hesitate to say that a preacher
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.780]   should never prepare his son.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.620]   They thought that was quite wrong.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.420]   That was a lack of faith.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.420]   What was the principle?
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:03.700]   Well, they sometimes quoted a verse which says, "Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.380]   it."
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:10.180]   So that all the preacher has to do is to enter into the pulpit and open his mouth and start
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.780]   speaking, and he will have everything that is necessary.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.180]   So that there is to be no preparation.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:21.020]   Another verse that they've often misquoted is Matthew 10, 19, where we are told, "Take
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:26.620]   no thought how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in the same hour what
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.620]   ye shall speak."
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.780]   There you are, they say, taking it right out of its context.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:38.780]   Our Lord is there dealing with his people on trial, in law courts, persecution, suddenly
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.780]   arrested and apprehended.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.980]   It's all right, he said, don't be troubled.
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:42.980]   I'll be with you.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.460]   I'll give you words to speak.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.780]   He's not talking about exercising ministry.
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.940]   He's not talking about preaching them.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.660]   But many people in this way have said, it's all right, it all comes from the Lord, and
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.340]   you mustn't bring in the human element into it.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.740]   You mustn't use your own mind.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.540]   You mustn't use your own understanding, your own knowledge.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.260]   No, no, you must rely entirely upon the Spirit.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.140]   It's a very interesting thing, this.
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:14.060]   They carry it so far as to say that a man should use none of his natural powers.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:19.560]   They would have said that a man like Whitfield was quite wrong in using the amazing oratorical
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:24.620]   powers that had been given to him by God in his natural birth.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.180]   No, no, oratory is all wrong, they say.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.180]   You mustn't have that.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.180]   That's the flesh.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.860]   They don't recognise that that's a gift of God.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:38.820]   No, you just be entirely passive and stand quietly, and it's given.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.620]   No preparation, no use of your natural faculties.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:49.820]   Well, now, the answer to all that, of course, is that it is utterly unscriptural.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.820]   You go through the scriptures and see the men whom God has used, see how they prepared
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.820]   themselves and their matter.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.540]   Paul spends three years in Arabia.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.540]   What was he doing there?
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.240]   Working it out, working out the Old Testament.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.780]   This thing had suddenly come.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.300]   How does he reconcile all this?
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:09.260]   He's got to have his case ready, so he spends his three years in Arabia.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.980]   And you will find that the men whom God has always used most signally have been the men
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:17.180]   who studied most, known their scriptures best, given time to preparation.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.900]   No, no, you see, it isn't this either/or.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.380]   The answer is you do your best and your utmost, but don't rely upon that.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.140]   Rely upon the Spirit.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.660]   I sometimes put it like this in addressing meetings of ministers.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:39.300]   I say the greatest danger to a minister in many ways is simply this, that having finished
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:44.700]   the preparation of your sermons for your Sunday, whenever you may chance to finish, whether
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:50.900]   it's Friday night or midday Saturday or Saturday evening, the danger is this, that you say,
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.860]   "Very well, I'm ready for tomorrow.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.860]   I've got my two sermons."
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.340]   No, the confusion is this.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.580]   He must have his two sermons.
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.780]   Yes, but if he relies upon his two sermons, it's no good.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.940]   The men should prepare his two sermons and put all his gut into them, but he should realize
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.400]   that unless the Spirit comes upon them, they'll be of no avail.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.780]   And what the Spirit generally uses is men's best preparation.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:22.700]   It isn't Spirit or preparation, it is preparation plus the unction and the anointing and that
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.300]   which the Holy Spirit alone can apply.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:30.660]   Now, you see, the danger is always to go to one or other of these two extremes, the moralists,
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:35.140]   the ethicists, who are doing it all themselves, they think, the people who say, "Ah, yes,
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.420]   I used to believe the whole of the Christian faith, but I've grown up now.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.140]   I've rejected all the dogmas, but I'm holding on to the ethic."
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.300]   That's wrong.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.740]   But then the opposite extreme is, "You do nothing.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:45.740]   It's all done for you.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.740]   Don't you make an effort?
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.420]   There mustn't be any effort in your...
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.580]   It's all the Lord...
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.820]   It's equally wrong."
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:57.140]   It is your effort, energized by the Lord, and you're relying upon him.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.300]   Now, there's no difficulty here, there's no contradiction.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.740]   That's where these illustrations are so helpful.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.500]   "Stretch forth thy hand.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.380]   Do it, make your effort, and you'll find you've done it."
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.740]   There is the mystery and the marvel.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:14.180]   Well, now, it's exactly the same with this matter of healing.
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:18.020]   There are many people who get into a trap and into a difficulty over this question of
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.580]   what is called faith healing.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.540]   It's the same point again.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:31.020]   They interpret faith healing to mean that you should use no means at all.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.340]   You should never make use of any drug, any medicament.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.900]   No, no, they say that would be lack of faith.
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.700]   You've got to leave it entirely to the Lord.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.060]   You've got to trust purely in him.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:46.140]   And they say you can't exercise faith if you're using means.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.300]   Now there is exactly the same confusion.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.420]   The answer, of course, is this.
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.260]   Who has provided us with the means?
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.860]   Where have these various drugs and medicaments come from?
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.300]   Well, they're found in nature, they're found in flowers, they're found in metals and various
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.300]   other places.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.300]   Who's put them there?
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.860]   God has provided us all things richly to enjoy.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.780]   God has provided all these things, and clearly he wouldn't have provided them unless we were
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.060]   meant to use them.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:18.380]   But you see, the danger again is to swing from one extreme to the other.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.740]   There are some people who rely upon the means only.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:27.300]   And that's the great danger today because of all our advances and developments and medical
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.340]   discoveries, God isn't needed.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.660]   And they trust the medicaments and the means.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.660]   That's wrong.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:36.180]   But then these others are equally wrong, who say you don't need means at all, God can do
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.840]   it all.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:43.700]   And they likewise so constantly find themselves in trouble.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:48.180]   Now there are some very wonderful illustrations with regard to this.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:52.940]   I always think one of the best is an incident in the life of Hudson Taylor, the founder
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.700]   of the China Inland Mission.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.140]   Those of you who remember his story will remember that at first, I think it was when he was
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:04.700]   even making his first voyage to China, he felt that it would be a lack of faith to make
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.500]   use of the life belts that were provided in the cabins.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.020]   He says, "No, that's lack of faith.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.340]   I must trust entirely to the Lord to keep me.
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.740]   I wouldn't dream of putting on this."
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:19.080]   But you remember, he came to see that that was quite wrong.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.860]   It isn't a lack of faith to use a life belt.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.960]   Put on your life belt, but trust in God still.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.360]   The life belt alone will probably not save you.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:33.100]   Use the means that are available, but put your confidence in God.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:38.100]   He came to see that and corrected what had appeared to him in the first instance to be
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.060]   the pure position of faith.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:45.500]   There's a similar illustration in the case of Andrew Murray of South Africa, a well-known
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   teacher.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:52.820]   He went through a period when he thought it was lack of faith, indeed a denial of faith
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.940]   to use means in medicine.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.860]   You must trust entirely to the Lord.
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.060]   You didn't need a doctor.
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.340]   You didn't need any medicaments.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:06.180]   But he likewise, as a result of painful experiences, came to see that it was very wrong, and at
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.980]   the end of his life, used both doctors and their medicaments.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.580]   But there was no lack of faith.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.500]   The ultimate faith is in God.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.380]   Well the last word on this, of course, was said by Oliver Crumwell.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:23.020]   Trust in God and keep your powder dry.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.500]   You don't just trust in God and do nothing.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.500]   You've got to fight.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.580]   Keep your powder dry.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.400]   Make certain that you can use it in the thick and the heat of the battle.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:37.580]   That you notice the order, trust in God and keep your powder dry.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:41.740]   And there's no doubt as you read the life of that great general, that you discover that
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.900]   his ultimate secret was his trust in God.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.940]   That was the ultimate thing, but he was wise enough to see that you need means and you've
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.060]   got to use them.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.100]   You don't just stand back and it's all done for.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:58.100]   No, no, trust in God and keep your powder dry.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.180]   Well now here it is, these illustrations are endless.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:07.060]   Let me put a final illustration in these stones.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:12.620]   Isn't this whole matter very similar to what we often do?
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:18.780]   When we're encouraging a child or somebody who's a beginner at something, you know what
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.340]   the beginner says, what the child says, "I can't do it."
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.940]   They're nervous, they're frightened, they've never done it.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.300]   They say, "I can't do it."
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:30.380]   Though they've seen people walking perhaps, the child feels that it can't, it's unsteady.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.820]   Or somebody's trying to ride a bicycle for the first time or any one of these things
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.500]   that they've never done before.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.460]   And they keep on saying that they can't do it.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:42.060]   How do you handle such a person?
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:47.940]   Well what you and I've got to do of course is to reassure them.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.740]   We've got to make them venture.
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.220]   We've got to show them that it can be done.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.940]   And what we normally do is this, isn't it?
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.980]   We just hold them as it were, but without their knowing it, we hold them less and less
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:59.980]   tightly.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:03.180]   At the end, our hand is just on them, it's not holding them at all.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:07.180]   And they go, and then we let go altogether, and they suddenly find they've done it.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:10.820]   Now they've got the power within them, latently, but they don't believe it, they don't know
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.940]   it.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.580]   And the only way in which they'll ever be able to walk or ride a bicycle or whatever
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.100]   it is to make the venture, they've got to make the effort, they've got to do all they
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.100]   can.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.100]   They'll always make much too much of an effort, I know.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.940]   But in this way, in the venture, they suddenly find they can do it.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:26.940]   Stretch forth their hand.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.020]   And the man stretched forth his hand.
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.260]   He found he'd got the ability, it was given to him.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.220]   Well now, work this out for yourselves.
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:42.380]   I've given this multiplicity of illustrations in order to try to help those who are still
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.420]   timorous, frightened, alarmed.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.660]   We are not meant to be like that.
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.660]   We are meant to listen to this great exhortation.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:56.380]   And as you hear it saying, "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might," it's
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.780]   no use you saying, "But I'm weak, I'm feeble."
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:02.180]   It's because you are, you're given the exhortation.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:06.380]   You're not being told that you've got this tremendous power in yourself and simply that
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:10.900]   no, no, what you're being told is this, that you're a child of God.
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.380]   That you've got a seed of divine life in you.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.380]   That you are united and related to Christ the head.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.780]   And you're always in that relationship.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.500]   And that as you do things in his name, you'll find you can do them.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:28.100]   You'll find you've got the power, the enabling, which is so necessary.
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:39.380]   And so, we find that the whole secret in this matter is to believe this word.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:46.740]   Is to believe that God is speaking to us through these very words.
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:53.500]   It isn't a slogan, it isn't just a general statement, it isn't just some kind of caption.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.540]   No, no, this is very practical.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:01.340]   And it works out just like that.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.780]   We take him at his word.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:09.540]   He's saying to every one of us in some shape or form, "Stretch forth thine hand.
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.420]   Stop saying, 'I can't do it.'
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.180]   Stop talking about your paralysis.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.660]   Listen to what I'm saying."
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.300]   There is the power given.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.300]   Do it.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   Go on doing it.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.660]   Keep on doing it.
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:31.820]   And as we put it into practice, we shall find that it is not only true, but infinitely more
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:35.500]   true than we've ever imagined or ever thought.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:43.260]   Taste, taste, and see that the Lord is good.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:48.060]   Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.900]   And at times you'll be amazed at your own strength and power.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.380]   You'll find it difficult to believe that it is really you.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.220]   Weak, faint, feeble.
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:07.180]   You'll be astonished at yourself and filled with amazement at the power and the strength
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:10.900]   and the authority which has been given to you.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.940]   Very well, there it is in practice.
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.180]   And you and I, whatever may be facing us, whatever may be set against us this morning
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:26.780]   in particular, have but to realize these precious truths, that the power is given, that he is
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:34.820]   with us, and that nothing shall ever be able to separate us from the love of God which
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:40.220]   is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:47.420]   The closing hymn is hymn number 512, and it is indeed an exhortation to us to continue.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.820]   Fight the good fight with all thy might.
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:54.540]   Christ is thy strength and Christ thy right.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:44:01.860]   Lay hold on life and it shall be thy joy and crown eternally.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:07.020]   Here again you get the perfect blending of our effort and activity and the strength and
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:11.060]   the power that are given. 512.
