[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   - Correct me if I'm wrong, but in your book, Selfish Gene,
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.320]   the gene-centered view of evolution allows us to think
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.240]   of the physical organisms as just the medium
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.480]   through which the software of our genetics
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.640]   and the ideas sort of propagate.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.240]   So maybe can we start just with the basics?
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.680]   What in this context does the word meme mean?
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.920]   - It would mean the cultural equivalent of a gene.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.120]   Cultural equivalent in the sense of that which plays
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.280]   the same role as the gene in the transmission of culture,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.760]   in the transmission of ideas in the broadest sense.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.640]   And it's only a useful word
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.280]   if there's something Darwinian going on.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520]   Obviously culture is transmitted,
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.800]   but is there anything Darwinian going on?
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.880]   And if there is, that means there has to be something
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.880]   like a gene which becomes more numerous
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.760]   or less numerous in the population.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.600]   - So it can replicate?
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   It can replicate?
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.920]   Well, it clearly does replicate.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.800]   There's no question about that.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.280]   The question is, does it replicate
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.440]   in a sort of differential way in a Darwinian fashion?
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.840]   Could you say that certain ideas propagate
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.080]   because they're successful in the meme pool?
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.400]   In a sort of trivial sense, you can.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.160]   Would you wish to say though that in the same way
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.160]   as an animal body is modified, adapted to serve
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.080]   as a machine for propagating genes,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.120]   is it also a machine for propagating memes?
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.480]   Could you actually say that something
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.440]   about the way a human is, is modified, adapted
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.560]   for the function of meme propagation?
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.680]   - That's such a fascinating possibility, if that's true.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.280]   That it's not just about the genes,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.560]   which seem somehow more comprehensible
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.560]   as like these things of biology.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.320]   The idea that culture or maybe ideas,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.600]   you can really broadly define it,
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.360]   operates under these mechanisms.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.040]   - Even morphology, even anatomy,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.320]   does evolve by memetic means.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.920]   I mean, things like hairstyles,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.480]   styles of makeup, circumcision,
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.440]   these things are actual changes in the body form
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.680]   which are non-genetic and which get passed on
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.920]   from generation to generation or sideways like a virus
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.320]   in a quasi-genetic way.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.480]   - But the moment you start drifting away from the physical,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.960]   it becomes interesting 'cause the space of ideas,
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.600]   ideologies, political systems.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.520]   - Of course, yes.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.040]   - So what's your sense?
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.200]   Are memes a metaphor more or are they really,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.120]   is there something fundamental,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.240]   almost physical presence of memes?
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.080]   - Well, I think they're a bit more than a metaphor
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.880]   and I think that, I mean, I mentioned
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.800]   that physical bodily characteristics
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.040]   which are a bit trivial in a way,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.600]   but when things like the propagation of religious ideas,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   both longitudinally down generations and transversely
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   as in a sort of epidemiology of ideas
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.520]   when a charismatic preacher converts people,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.640]   that resembles viral transmission.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.040]   Whereas the longitudinal transmission
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.600]   from grandparent to parent, to child, et cetera,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.080]   is more like conventional genetic transmission.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.800]   - That's such a beautiful,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.240]   especially in the modern day idea.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.800]   Do you think about this implication in social networks
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.400]   where the propagation of ideas,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.360]   the viral propagation of ideas,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.640]   and hence the new use of the word meme to describe--
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.520]   - The internet, of course, provides extremely rapid method
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.600]   of transmission.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.080]   Before, when I first coined the word,
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.120]   the internet didn't exist.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.760]   And so I was thinking then in terms of books, newspapers,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.480]   broad radio, television, that kind of thing.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.520]   Now an idea can just leap around the world
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.320]   in all directions instantly.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.880]   And so the internet provides a step change
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.080]   in the facility of propagation of memes.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.520]   - How does that make you feel?
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.000]   Isn't it fascinating that sort of ideas,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.920]   it's like you have Galapagos Islands or something,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.800]   it's the '70s, and the internet allowed all these species
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.200]   to just like globalize.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.240]   And in a matter of seconds,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.080]   you could spread a message to millions of people.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.600]   And these ideas, these memes can breed,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.040]   can evolve, can mutate, there's a selection,
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.120]   and there's like different, I guess, groups that evolve.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.400]   Like there's a dynamics that's fascinating here.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.480]   Do you think-- - Yes.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.400]   - Basically, do you think your work in this direction,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.560]   while fundamentally it was focused on life on earth,
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.120]   do you think it should continue to be taken further?
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.160]   - I mean, I do think it would probably be a good idea
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.320]   to think in a Darwinian way about this sort of thing.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.920]   We conventionally think of the transmission of ideas
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.480]   in evolutionary context as being limited to,
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.040]   in our ancestors, people living in villages,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.320]   living in small bands where everybody knew each other
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.160]   and ideas could propagate within the village,
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   and they might hop to a neighboring village occasionally,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.080]   and maybe even to a neighboring continent eventually.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.120]   And that was a slow process.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.720]   Nowadays, villages are international.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.280]   I mean, you have people, it's been called echo chambers,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.880]   where people are in a sort of internet village,
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.440]   where the other members of the village
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.280]   may be geographically distributed all over the world,
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.760]   but they just happen to be interested in the same things,
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.520]   use the same terminology, the same jargon,
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.840]   have the same enthusiasm.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.560]   So people like the Flat Earth Society,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.440]   they don't all live in one place.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.560]   They find each other,
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.120]   and they talk the same language to each other,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.920]   talk the same nonsense to each other.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.560]   But so this is a kind of distributed version
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.040]   of the primitive idea of people living in villages
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.560]   and propagating their ideas in a local way.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.320]   - Is there a Darwinist parallel here?
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.840]   So is there evolutionary purpose of villages,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.160]   or is that just a-
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.960]   - Oh, I wouldn't use a word like evolutionary purpose
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.840]   in that case,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.440]   but villages will be something that just emerged.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.680]   That's the way people happen to live.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.880]   - And in just the same kind of way,
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.840]   the Flat Earth Society, societies of ideas
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.480]   emerge in the same kind of way in this digital space.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.880]   - Yes, yes.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.920]   - Is there something interesting to say about the,
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.840]   I guess, from a perspective of Darwin,
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.440]   could we fully interpret the dynamics
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.240]   of social interaction in these social networks?
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.720]   Or is there some much more complicated thing
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.200]   need to be developed?
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.160]   Like, what's your sense?
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.360]   - Well, a Darwinian selection idea
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.200]   would involve investigating which ideas spread
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.560]   and which don't.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.840]   So some ideas don't have the ability to spread.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.280]   I mean, flat earthism is,
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.280]   there are a few people believe in it,
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.240]   but it's not gonna spread
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.760]   because it's obvious nonsense.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.160]   But other ideas, even if they are wrong,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.360]   can spread because they are attractive in some sense.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.400]   - So the spreading and the selection
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.080]   in the Darwinian context,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.680]   it just has to be attractive in some sense.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.200]   Like, we don't have to define,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.520]   like, it doesn't have to be attractive
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.480]   in the way that animals attract each other.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.080]   It could be attractive in some other way.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.000]   - Yes, all that matters is,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.640]   all that is needed is that it should spread.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.520]   And it doesn't have to be true to spread.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.280]   In truth is one criterion
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.520]   which might help an idea to spread.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.960]   But there are other criteria
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.880]   which might help it to spread.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.320]   As you say, attraction in animals
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.760]   is not necessarily valuable for survival.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.280]   The famous peacock's tail
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.320]   doesn't help the peacock to survive.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.160]   It helps it to pass on its genes.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.200]   Similarly, an idea which is actually rubbish,
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.800]   but which people don't know is rubbish
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.920]   and think is very attractive will spread
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.200]   in the same way as a peacock's genes spread.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.320]   - As a small sidestep,
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.000]   I remember reading somewhere,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.080]   I think recently, that in some species of birds,
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.840]   sort of the idea that beauty may have its own purpose
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.960]   and the idea that some birds,
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   I'm being ineloquent here,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.240]   but there is some aspects of their feathers and so on
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.360]   that serve no evolutionary purpose whatsoever.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.280]   There's somebody making an argument
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.080]   that there are some things about beauty that animals do
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.480]   that may be its own purpose.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.320]   Does that ring a bell for you?
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.840]   Does it sound ridiculous?
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.800]   - I think it's a rather distorted bell.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:25.080]   Darwin, when he coined the phrase sexual selection,
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.440]   didn't feel the need to suggest
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.600]   that what was attractive to females,
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.680]   usually it's males attracting females,
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.000]   that what females found attractive had to be useful.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.840]   He said it didn't have to be useful.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.520]   It was enough that females found it attractive.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.160]   And so it could be completely useless,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.280]   probably was completely useless in the conventional sense,
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.520]   but was not at all useless in the sense of passing on,
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.720]   well, Darwin didn't call them genes,
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.320]   but in the sense of reproducing.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.120]   Others, starting with Wallace,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.200]   the co-discoverer of natural selection,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.360]   didn't like that idea.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.120]   And they wanted sexually selected characteristics
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.320]   like peacock's tails to be in some sense useful.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.080]   It's a bit of a stretch to think of a peacock's tail
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.800]   as being useful, but in the sense of survival,
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.280]   but others have run with that idea
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.400]   and have brought it up to date.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.320]   And so there's a kind of,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.360]   there are two schools of thought on sexual selection,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.880]   which are still active and about equally supported now.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.680]   Those who follow Darwin in thinking that it's just enough
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.640]   to say it's attractive.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.920]   And those who follow Wallace and say that
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.160]   it has to be in some sense useful.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.480]   - Do you fall into one category or the other?
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.760]   - No, I'm open-minded.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.440]   I think they both could be correct in different cases.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.360]   - Oh.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.720]   - I mean, they've both been made sophisticated
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.200]   in a mathematical sense,
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.760]   more so than when Darwin and Wallace
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.480]   first started talking about it.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.680]   - I'm Russian, I romanticize things,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.440]   so I prefer the former.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.280]   - Yes.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.200]   - Where the beauty in itself is a powerful,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.960]   so attraction is a powerful force in evolution.

[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.560]   (upbeat music)
