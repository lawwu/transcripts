[00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.800]   Today, Radical Personal Finance, live Q&A.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:20.240]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.840]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.120]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.280]   to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.640]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.560]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.600]   My name is Joshua Sheath.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.600]   Today is Friday, April 19th, 2024.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.800]   And on this Friday, as I do on any Friday,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.640]   in which I can arrange the appropriate recording technology,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.340]   we do live Q&A.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.600]   Live Q&A works just like call and talk radio works,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.000]   or used to work, we just moved on to the internet.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.160]   I show up to a phone line, you show up to a phone line,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.800]   we chat, you get to run the conversation,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.280]   you ask about anything that you want,
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.760]   bring up any topics of discussion,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.520]   bring up any questions that you have,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.320]   you run the podcast on these Friday Q&A shows.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.440]   If you'd like to gain access to one of these shows,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.280]   you can do that by becoming a patron of the show.

[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.480]   to one of these Friday Q&A shows.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.440]   We begin with Mava in Texas.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.940]   Mava, welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.160]   - Hi, Joshua, thank you for taking my call.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.080]   I'm a long-time listener, just haven't called in before,
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.440]   but I'm glad you took my call.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.400]   Just have a quick question about just thinking
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.280]   about the sliding scale benefit of a full-time parent.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.780]   So situation, husband and I have an infant,
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.520]   thinking about dual income going to single income,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.840]   thinking about the point at which,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.960]   with a general interest in home education
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.840]   or just kind of a high level of involvement in child life,
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.560]   when to kind of think about that transition,
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160]   because obviously exiting the workforce
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.760]   kind of goes against everything from a quick trajectory
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.380]   towards financial independence
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.440]   and those more quantitative goals.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.520]   So kind of think sliding scale on the quantitative side,
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.640]   but just the qualitative aspects of engagement,
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.520]   you can probably see that as being really important
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.520]   at age five, age six, but thinking about infant to six,
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.040]   going from dual to single income,
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.160]   thinking about it strategically, appreciate your thoughts.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.820]   - Sure, how much money do you earn currently?
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.880]   - 120.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.800]   - And your husband?
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.840]   - 200.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.800]   - So you are in the situation
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.560]   that is probably the most difficult,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.000]   which is probably why you're calling in to talk about it,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.840]   because there is a financial answer
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.560]   and there's a non-financial answer,
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080]   and it's difficult to know
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.000]   how to value the non-financial answer.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.240]   Let's begin with the financial answer.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.600]   If there is a woman who is earning,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.120]   let's say 30 or $40,000 per year,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.420]   and she is considering leaving her paid income
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.720]   in order to become a full-time mother and homemaker,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.760]   and if her husband earns enough money
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.480]   to support the family without her income,
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.920]   then the financial incentive for her to do so
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.000]   is pretty obvious.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.640]   After all, what does daycare cost in your area?
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.480]   Any idea?
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.080]   - Haven't yet explored,
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.000]   have good kind of community family support,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.560]   so haven't had to price that out,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.480]   but I anticipate probably at least 400 to 500 a week
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.440]   at a minimum for the standard care we would be interested in.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.560]   - Yeah, so that's what I would guess.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.860]   So you have a couple thousand dollars per month right there,
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.360]   and if you go through
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.200]   all of the different financial aspects of it
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.640]   and you calculate,
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.560]   a mother who's at that modest income range
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.200]   would probably come out ahead
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.820]   with her being a full-time stay-at-home mother.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.600]   So we can start with taxes.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.200]   We would remember that her income is the most highly taxed
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.240]   because it's the marginal additional income.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.320]   So let's say that she leaves her $40,000 a year job.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.240]   There's gonna be good tax savings
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.800]   because that's gonna be $40,000 less at the top end,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   at the highest marginal tax rate of that couple.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.280]   Then we could get into
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.200]   the specific clear obvious costs of daycare,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.880]   which can be calculated,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.880]   recognizing that generally speaking,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.940]   the costs of daycare are gonna be a post-tax cost,
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.200]   notwithstanding the various,
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.320]   perhaps you maybe have eligibility
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.960]   for a tax credit of some kind,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.020]   but we're gonna have direct costs of daycare.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.420]   Then we can look into all of the other costs of working
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.400]   that are associated.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.240]   So this family, for example,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.160]   would frequently have two cars.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.080]   They might be able to go from two cars to one car,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.160]   or to some, maybe instead of having a brand new car
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.640]   that's reliable and fancy and shiny,
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.840]   now we can swap out that more expensive car
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.040]   for a cheaper car,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.520]   and that might drop the car insurance payments.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.120]   It might drop the overall gasoline consumption.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.200]   Maybe now where the family was eating out
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   two or three nights a week
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.540]   because everyone was tired and no one wanted to cook,
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.420]   well now maybe she has the energy
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.780]   that we can eat at home more,
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.940]   and there's a savings on the grocery budget.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.380]   Maybe she's able to shop more efficiently
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.740]   and get better deals for the family
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.260]   on the overall costs of living,
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.100]   and she can plan really amazing, inexpensive vacations.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.940]   And then just simply,
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.020]   there's a huge quality of life increase.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.500]   With the additional hours,
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.220]   she might be able to mow the lawn on Wednesday morning
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.820]   so that Saturday can be family day
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.880]   instead of her husband having to be out there
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.320]   mowing the lawn on Saturday morning.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.980]   Maybe just they have more fun together
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.240]   because she's more relaxed.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   She's not stressed.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.160]   She's not depressed.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.720]   She's not dealing with workplace drama.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.120]   Instead of being stuck in trying to figure out
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.840]   how to vacation on two bosses' schedules,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.760]   all they gotta deal with is one job and one boss's schedule.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.280]   So those are some of the various lifestyle benefits,
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.300]   but it's a pretty obvious financial choice
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.620]   for a mother who is earning a more modest income.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.680]   However, that probably caps out
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.200]   somewhere around the 50 to $60,000 a year number.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.120]   Even if I go really aggressive
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.440]   with all the savings that can be had,
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.760]   at the end of the day, if a mother is earning,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.440]   again, I'm just guessing, maybe more than 50 or $60,000,
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.220]   I don't think you can make a financial argument
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.440]   that the family is gonna have more money
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.360]   for her to be a stay-at-home mom
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.520]   than for the family to have a daycare
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.360]   and put the children into daycare.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   Financially, I don't see that argument.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.520]   The numbers don't work.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.040]   And the numbers don't work partly
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.280]   because her income now is more significant
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.560]   to exceed all of those costs that I've described,
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.600]   but also because the second financial consideration
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.960]   always has to be counted in,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.180]   which is, is there a potential harm,
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.060]   either an actual harm or a potential harm,
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.500]   to her long-term career ambitions and her job prospects
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.020]   based upon her being out of the workforce?
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.720]   In a highly corporatized society,
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.760]   there is often very little value
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.560]   that an employer is going to place
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.120]   upon her and her work experience
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.460]   if she takes time out from the workforce
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.560]   and then stays at home.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.780]   And this is something that a lot of women find challenging.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.080]   When they go back into the workforce,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.480]   well, I've been kind of out of touch,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.720]   my network has grown sour.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.840]   Before I was Miss Corporate Hotshot,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.760]   I had all the connections, all of the network,
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.160]   I had all of the opportunities built up,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.720]   but now all my friends are mothers with babies
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.280]   and all the people that I associate with,
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.880]   I don't even have my professional wardrobe anymore
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.720]   and these kinds of things.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.680]   And so she goes back to get into the workforce
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.980]   and get a job again.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.120]   And she, instead of having five more years of experience
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.180]   and five more advancements in her career,
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.340]   well, now there's a slower pathway for her
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.800]   and it may take her quite some time
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.120]   to catch up from a career perspective.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.860]   So if your income exceeds that,
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.580]   I don't see how you can make a financial argument
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.080]   in favor of being a stay-at-home mother.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.960]   And so quantitatively, again,
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.280]   with the exceptions that I've said,
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.720]   if your income is quite modest,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.620]   then quantitatively, financially,
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.880]   you will be better off always working,
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.200]   working, working, working,
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.240]   earning money, earning money, earning money,
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.120]   and then paying other people to take care of your children.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.480]   Now, when I say it like that,
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.360]   it should grate on your nerves a little bit
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.160]   because wait a second, that's not what I'm trying to do,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.320]   but in reality, that is what is happening.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.440]   And so let's talk about why is it the case
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.560]   that this is what we're doing?
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.800]   Well, first of all,
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.500]   let's say that you did become a stay-at-home mother.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.500]   Well, your child would have a one-to-one daycare provider
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.760]   to student relationship.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.320]   And that daycare provider herself
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.120]   would be a highly educated, highly motivated,
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.760]   very socially competent worker
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.680]   who has all kinds of experience
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.720]   and is filled with love and patience
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.740]   for her individual child.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.880]   If you go and take your child to a daycare,
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.400]   you're generally gonna have a relatively lowly paid worker
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.320]   who is working in a ratio of, I don't know,
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.080]   four to one, five to one, depending on the daycare,
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.040]   four or five students to one low-paid worker
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.440]   taking care of your child.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.400]   And so you can automatically see
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.520]   where the cost savings for daycare come from.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.120]   The cost savings for daycare come from the fact
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.960]   that instead of you providing
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.520]   the kind of mothering experience that you could provide,
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.680]   you are hiring a low-paid worker
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.240]   to provide a basic custodial care experience.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.320]   And you may have higher-end daycares,
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.080]   you may have environments with more child stimulation,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.440]   and there may be benefits that children get to play
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.160]   with others and things like that.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.000]   But the point is you're substantially downgrading
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.920]   the quality of care that a child is available,
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.000]   that a child is able to experience in that kind of model.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.200]   So what other, so there's no way that,
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.640]   I don't know how to measure that on a financial scale.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.960]   How do I say, if we know, for example,
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.960]   that a huge amount of a child's social emotional control
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.560]   is built based upon his relationship with his mother,
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.880]   and we know that when he's taken out of that
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.960]   and he's subjected to being separated from his mother,
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.680]   what is the cost of that in the long-term in his life?
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.520]   We don't know.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.120]   We know that it's subpar.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.880]   We know that it's absolutely inferior.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.040]   We know that emotional regulation is enormously higher
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.360]   for children who are with their mother
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.280]   than for children who are in a daycare environment,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.040]   and we know that that's measurable
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.320]   throughout a child's lifetime,
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.160]   but I don't know how to put a dollar figure on that.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.440]   I know it's absolutely there.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.880]   I know it's absolutely measurable,
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.500]   and I don't know what price we would assign to that value.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.000]   Similarly, if we look to educational outcomes
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.720]   or morals or vocabulary development,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.480]   on every single metric, the child's performance
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.920]   on long-term social studies will always be highest
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.720]   if he is with his mother and with his family,
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.680]   with his siblings, and so we can track that.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.340]   Children who are entered into a daycare environment
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.740]   are noticeably behind the curve on all of these factors
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.840]   because of the inferior social environment,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.000]   but I don't know how to put a number on that,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.760]   so I know that it's real.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.640]   I know that there is a value there,
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.760]   but I don't know how to put a number on it,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.200]   so I think a lot of times what I see happening
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.640]   is that it's going to wind up being a qualitative decision
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.440]   that's just simply based upon vision,
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.920]   based upon what you want.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.120]   I think in your situation, what you've described
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.200]   is based upon the income that you earn
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.780]   and the income that your husband earns,
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.140]   you have two difficult decisions.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.400]   Number one, if you're earning $120,000,
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.600]   you're earning that because your career
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.040]   is something that you've worked hard on,
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.840]   you've developed yourself, and you've built a strong career
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.700]   that provides you with a significant amount of income.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.720]   So that's great.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.600]   The problem is then it's harder to leave.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.480]   It's harder to take that time out,
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.020]   and so you're going to need more compelling reasons
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.380]   to do that than many people face.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.620]   However, on the flip side,
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.240]   your husband also earns a great income,
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.840]   and so you guys could still have plenty of money
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.960]   based upon his income, and so you have an easier decision
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.920]   if that were a path that you would want to go down.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.400]   You have an easier decision than, say,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.920]   someone whose husband is earning $50,000.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.840]   It's not easy to make it on a $50,000 household income.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.440]   So if you were earning $50,000
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.360]   and he were earning $50,000,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.440]   that would be a big hit to your lifestyle
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.240]   for you to stop earning an income.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.840]   In your case, however, if you're earning $120,000
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.560]   and he's earning $200,000, the hit to your lifestyle
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.420]   would be less a matter of lifestyle
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.840]   and more a matter of less savings.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.040]   You could live the same or similar lifestyle
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.300]   to what you're living now,
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.960]   but your savings plan would slow down.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.360]   Your financial independence plan would slow down.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.920]   What's that worth to you?
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.760]   I don't know.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.160]   What I would suggest to you
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.400]   is that you not try to make that decision today,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.160]   but rather that you put a plan in place
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.680]   so that you could be a full-time mother if you wanted to.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.320]   And what I mean by that is anytime I'm counseling a couple
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.000]   who's having a baby, especially a baby for the first time,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.620]   and if they have any inclination or draw at all
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.520]   to the mother being a full-time stay-at-home mom,
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.440]   then what I encourage them to do is to split their income
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.800]   and only live on the husband's income
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.480]   and save all of the wife's income
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.780]   and do whatever is necessary in order to make that happen.
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.040]   So if you have to pay down debt or whatever you gotta do,
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.680]   if you just only resolve that going forward,
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.720]   we are only gonna live on his income
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.960]   and all of your income gets set aside into a separate account
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.660]   that way you would know what you're getting into
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.380]   if you chose to stop earning income for a time.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.220]   Number two is there's not really a need
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.620]   to decide this stuff much in advance
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.020]   when you're having a baby.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.680]   So what I mean is let's say that you get pregnant
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.780]   and you're expecting a baby
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.500]   and the baby's expected in 40 weeks.
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.640]   Okay, well, fine.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.100]   You don't need to march into your boss's office that day
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.660]   and say, "I'm having a baby, I'm done here."
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.540]   And you don't even need to do it
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.980]   at any time in the pregnancy.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.740]   You can take the pregnancy, take maternity leave,
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.540]   and then you can always decide to quit your job
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.260]   in the future if you want to.
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.900]   And in today's world, though, of course,
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.340]   all of us would like to provide our bosses
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.980]   with substantial upfront warning
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.280]   so they can hire someone else.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.020]   At the end of the day, if you want to provide your,
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.740]   at the end of the day,
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.080]   you're better off just keeping it to yourself.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.780]   Take maternity leave and see what happens.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.660]   My observation from talking with a lot of mothers
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.100]   is that prior to the baby being there,
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.660]   they often feel more strongly
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.100]   about continuing their income,
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.540]   and they don't worry too much about their baby.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.700]   But once the baby's there,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.720]   they tend to fall in love with their baby.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.420]   And after a few months with the baby,
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.580]   then when everything has changed
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.100]   in terms of their relationship with their baby,
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.140]   then they see, these mothers see things
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.340]   through a different lens.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.820]   And I watch it happen with my wife, with every baby.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.300]   My wife is, okay, when the baby is in her tummy,
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.100]   okay, fine, it's a baby and we can talk about it.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.660]   But then the baby comes out,
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.820]   and those first few days of a baby's life,
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.700]   I watch her fall in love with the baby.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.060]   And it's just so obvious.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.700]   It's so crystal clear as I watch it happen.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.000]   And I think that's generally a common experience.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.960]   So I would say, don't try too hard
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.660]   to make the decision in advance.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.580]   Position yourself so that if you wanted
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.580]   to be a stay-at-home mom, you could.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.080]   And then just wait and see.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.140]   Wait and see what your experience is
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.200]   after the baby's there.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.660]   Wait and see what happens with your family dynamic
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.940]   and consider it.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.180]   The third and final thing I wanna,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.780]   or the final option I wanna point out
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.780]   is there are third options.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:30.140]   So I said option one is full-time stay-at-home mom.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.140]   Option two is putting your child into a low-cost daycare.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.060]   There are many third options.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.220]   So third options include family being involved.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.180]   Third options include working from home,
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.280]   having an in-home nanny, someone who's there with you.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.700]   Throughout history, we have worked,
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.580]   knowing these problems that I've described,
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.780]   throughout history, wealthy families
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.220]   have found solutions to this.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.620]   And aristocratic, wealthy families,
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.580]   it's generally normal that your children
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.500]   would have a governess, a full-time governess or nanny,
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.300]   someone who's fully responsible for childcare.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.840]   And so there may be other options.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.080]   And if your income is very important to you,
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.760]   but you're trying to kind of split the difference,
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.580]   then I think you should pursue these options.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.740]   I think you should say, how could I have family members,
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.300]   how could I work from home so that I'm more available?
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.420]   I'm not spending time commuting into the city.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.260]   How could I have family members providing care
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.580]   during certain times?
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.260]   Could I find one individual that would be
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260]   a really great asset to our family to care for this child
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.660]   so that I can continue to work?
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.700]   And I think that people who are,
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.700]   women who are in a situation like you're in,
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.740]   where you're a somewhat high earner
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.500]   and you have this desire to provide
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.580]   all those positive things for your child,
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.380]   will often pursue something related to that third path.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:52.520]   - Thanks, Joshua, appreciate your input.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.980]   - My pleasure, anything else?
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.180]   - That'll be it for today, thank you.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.660]   - Call me back in the future and we'll talk more.
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.080]   Mike in Minnesota, welcome to the show.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.380]   How can I serve you today?
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.620]   - Hi, Josh, we spoke a few years ago
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.780]   and then again last year about my wife and I
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.380]   spending extended time in South Africa with her family.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.620]   And after we spoke, you said I should call you back
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.540]   and tell you how it went.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.740]   - Yeah, tell me about it.
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.700]   - We're back and I figured I'd tell you how it went.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.420]   Okay, so a couple of things that we spoke about,
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.060]   I guess the rewind is that we went from
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:37.380]   the day after Thanksgiving, late in November of 2023
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.920]   through February of 2024 and spent 90 days.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.420]   I wasn't gonna be able to renew my visa to stay,
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.140]   so we just stayed for 90 days
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.020]   and then came back to Minnesota.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:56.020]   And in our time there, we stayed with my wife's brother-in-law
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.340]   in the granny flat out back.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.020]   So we had a lot of time with my wife's family
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.900]   visiting their nieces, the nephew
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.260]   and her brother and parents.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.580]   And so that was all great.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.340]   You also, you mentioned we should maximize the time
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.200]   that we have and instead of kind of looking at things
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:28.060]   through the prism of geo-arbitrage and dollar save
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.020]   to rather utilize that time well.
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:36.020]   So we had some four-wheel drive trips to Lesotho.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.740]   I actually had a brother of mine come over
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.780]   for the New Year's break and we went to Mozambique
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.700]   and went four-wheel driving there.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.820]   And yeah, I had a great time.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.500]   And I guess I really appreciated your perspective
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.380]   that you've kind of offered
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.980]   through your international travels on the podcast
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.740]   and found a lot of inspiration in that.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.500]   And so it's definitely something
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.540]   that we're planning on repeating again.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.540]   And I don't know for how long we can be snowbirds
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.140]   and leave the North American winter and go to South Africa,
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.420]   but while we're able to,
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.460]   we're going to keep trying to do that.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.940]   - How old are your children?
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.940]   How old were they on this previous trip?
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.900]   - So we don't have children yet.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.180]   We were just visiting my wife's family
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:29.020]   and seeing her nieces and nephews.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.060]   - Perfect.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.660]   - We actually are planning on starting our family,
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.980]   I guess, probably planning to have,
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.500]   if all goes to plan,
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.460]   we would try to have a child in 2025
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.420]   when we return from our trip next year.
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.820]   And that actually is one of the things
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.820]   that I wanted to ask you about,
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.780]   is have you found any challenges
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.620]   with traveling with your wife
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.940]   as your family has grown while she's pregnant?
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.820]   If I was to put my thumb in the wind and take a guess,
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.380]   I would guess we would probably try to have,
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.380]   you know, start our family maybe two or three months
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.380]   after returning from South Africa in 2025.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.340]   And so that would mean we would be traveling
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.300]   during her pregnancy.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.140]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.620]   - Yeah, I'll comment on that just a moment before I do.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.460]   - Sure.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.820]   - You were working from, while you were abroad,
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.620]   you were working from abroad, is that correct?
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.460]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:42.460]   So I'm a W-2, you know, employee,
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.220]   and so I had, I think we had discussed,
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.980]   I actually spent quite a while in a job search
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.700]   looking for an opportunity
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.980]   that would allow our family to do this.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.980]   And so, yeah, I worked U.S. hours in South Africa.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.020]   Mostly I would work two to 11 p.m.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.100]   And I found the adjustment was actually pretty well
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.940]   to my liking, except for times
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.980]   where there was something going on in the evening
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.980]   and friends wanted to meet up or something like that.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.100]   That was, you know, a bit of a drag.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.380]   The rest of it was really nice.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.260]   We had our days free, you know,
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.340]   mornings were all to us and it was kind of easier
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.820]   to spend our time freely that way,
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.300]   except for when it came to meeting up with friends
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.060]   who were on, you know, a standard schedule there.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.900]   - How did you--
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.580]   - But yeah, that worked out very well.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.420]   - How did you arrange your affairs in Minnesota
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.900]   with your house and things like that
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.900]   so that you could be away for that long?
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:46.700]   - Yeah, so we got a sublet for our apartment
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.860]   that we rented.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.980]   And that situation has just changed.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.260]   When we got back, we actually moved again.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.740]   And so we'll probably have to climb that mountain again
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.780]   for this winter.
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:03.860]   We, you know, we'd be able to afford to go there
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:09.020]   and still pay our rent that we're paying here.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.500]   But it was certainly convenient to have somebody else
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.260]   paying almost all the rent while we were gone.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.700]   So we'll try to crack that code again when we go,
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.260]   but it's not, it wouldn't prevent us.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.820]   - Taking into account all of the, sorry,
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.580]   taking into account all of the extra money
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.540]   that you spent on activities,
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.500]   would you say you spent about the same in Minnesota
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.220]   as compared to South Africa?
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.260]   Little less, little more, substantially less,
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.820]   substantially more, how would you compare
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.380]   your expenses during that time?
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.740]   - Oh, see, now you've--
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.140]   - Just vaguely, just broadly.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.060]   - I'm a numbers guy.
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:43.900]   - Okay, just broadly.
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.220]   - Yeah, broadly we saved.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.260]   So I would say we probably,
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.100]   just our overall spend over three months
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:56.020]   was probably $2,000 less with far more dining out there
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.700]   than we would have done here,
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.420]   and then far more in the way of travel for vacation
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.940]   and leisure and stuff like that.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.980]   - That's great.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.420]   Yeah, I just wanted to draw that out
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.220]   because here I got a live, real live testimonial
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.660]   that you called me in with.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.700]   And I think when we have the opportunity,
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.660]   we wanna share these ideas one with another,
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.100]   because we live in a time in which this lifestyle
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.580]   that once would have been the domain
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.140]   of a wealthy, financially independent multi-millionaire
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.100]   to be able to go abroad for the winter
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.340]   is now something that is available to,
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.460]   don't be insulted, but a simple worker, right?
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.780]   You have a job, and you can go abroad,
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.420]   and here you are, you can get out of Minnesota
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.420]   for three months, go to beautiful South Africa,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.780]   enjoy your time there,
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.340]   and enjoy a totally different set of experiences
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.380]   that really bring a more,
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.860]   a stronger joie de vivre on a daily basis
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.900]   than you would sitting in Minnesota during the winter.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.020]   And yet, financially speaking,
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.700]   you may have even saved a little bit of money,
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.980]   be a little bit ahead of where you
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.380]   otherwise would have been.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.260]   And that's what's so cool about geo-arbitrage.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.860]   And the way that you've done it is, I think, ideal,
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.780]   where, and what I mean is, you didn't move abroad,
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.300]   you didn't sever all your relationships,
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.900]   you didn't get rid of all your stuff.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.340]   That's really disruptive.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.860]   You just kept everything just how it is.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.660]   You just went abroad or went elsewhere for a few months.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.100]   And then during that few months,
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.940]   you experience a different lifestyle,
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.420]   and then when you returned back to Minnesota,
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.980]   or when you returned back to Minnesota,
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.100]   I would guess that you had a newfound appreciation
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.900]   for many aspects of your lifestyle there, is that right?
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.820]   - Yes, certainly.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.420]   And it also helped us consider what it is that we valued
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.180]   in the place that we're moving to.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.740]   And so I think we've made better decisions
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.380]   on the return as well.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.780]   - Good, I love that.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.900]   All right, I cut you off.
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.740]   You were gonna say one more thing,
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.660]   and then I'll answer your baby question.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.860]   - Yeah, I was gonna say, I was just,
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:56.700]   I'm very proud of, my wife also was instrumental
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.140]   in making this opportunity a reality,
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.140]   because she took a leap in her business
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.420]   that she does full-time,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.380]   and she actually hosted some photographers,
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.740]   two different flights of wedding photographers
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.740]   that came to a safari retreat that we reserved,
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:20.820]   and we captured wedding content for these photographers
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.540]   who want to appear adventurous
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.020]   and capture interesting wedding content.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.020]   And so that was a new leap in her business,
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.140]   and that's another enabling feature.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:40.260]   So yeah, definitely planning to redo that.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.180]   - That is super cool.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.540]   I love it, I love it.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.780]   All right, to answer the question, it's fairly simple.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.380]   So there's the technical,
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.300]   or what I'll call just the legal side.
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.620]   It's not dealing with the law.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.220]   It's just more of a policy.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.740]   And then there's the real side.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:58.620]   So is it difficult for a pregnant woman to fly?
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.220]   The answer is basically no.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.620]   Each airline will have its own individual policy
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.700]   related to how many weeks pregnant you can fly.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.940]   In general, they will allow you to fly very pregnant,
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.860]   although some of them will ask,
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.420]   let's say you're at 38 weeks.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.020]   They'll say, we'd really like you to have a doctor's note
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.180]   saying that it's okay for you to fly.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:24.180]   But in practice, very rarely is an airline employee,
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:30.860]   in many cases a rather low-level airline employee,
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:35.380]   going to ask a pregnant mother how pregnant she is.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.980]   And different mothers carry their babies
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.220]   in very different ways.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.580]   There are some mothers who they're at 39 weeks,
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.660]   and you would think, ah, she's 15 weeks pregnant.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.300]   And there's other mothers who are at 20 weeks,
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.260]   and you think she's at 39 weeks.
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.860]   So different mothers carry babies in different ways.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.940]   And because we all, I mean, you and I,
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.100]   I would assume you feel like me,
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.900]   you don't even wanna ask a woman if she's pregnant,
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.300]   unless she's very, very clearly pregnant,
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.900]   and she has confirmed with verbal affirmation.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.340]   I'm not gonna ask a mother if she's pregnant.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.860]   I'm not gonna say anything about it.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.300]   And so airline employees are no different.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.820]   And they just, the only reason for the policy
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.300]   is they would prefer for a woman
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.700]   not to go into labor during flight.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.140]   That makes for an inconvenient situation for the air crew.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.460]   So technically speaking, each airline will have a policy.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.660]   The policies vary, but practically speaking,
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.940]   no one's really ever gonna ask you about that.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.520]   I think what's more important for you
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.140]   is that you will want to have a plan
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.180]   for your wife to have high-quality prenatal care.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.420]   It's very, very important that a pregnant mother
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.060]   has high-quality prenatal care.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:43.020]   And it will be quite inconvenient for you
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.740]   to have that prenatal care in two locations
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.460]   or multiple locations and have the same high quality of care.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.500]   And with a mother's first baby,
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.500]   there's a significant level of unknown.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.300]   Because we tend to be somewhat isolated,
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.100]   it seems to me, I'm making this up,
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.660]   you verify with your wife,
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.280]   but I think the first birth that most women ever attend
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.460]   is the birth of their first child.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.800]   And so if it were different,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.300]   if she had training as a midwife or if she had visited,
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.900]   she had attended her sister's births
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.540]   or her brother's birth going up or she'd been in that,
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.660]   then that would be something.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.020]   But in general, the first birth
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.460]   that a first-time mother in our culture attends
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.380]   is the birth of her own child,
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.780]   which means that she has quite a lot of skills
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.220]   that she needs to learn.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:31.020]   And your best birthing outcome will come
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.220]   if your wife feels incredibly strong
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.500]   and confident and empowered and exactly,
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.420]   she has everything arranged exactly as she wants it to be.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:47.060]   And so I think in general, because of that,
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.380]   you will want to have a situation
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.700]   in which she is fully in control
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.780]   and completely has everything lined up
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.220]   exactly as she wants it.
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.700]   She has the exact prenatal care that she wants.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.940]   She has the exact helpers,
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.460]   whether it's a midwife or her doctor
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.540]   or whoever it is that she's interacting with.
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.180]   She has a very warm and comfortable relationship.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.700]   And you want her to feel the strong sense
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.700]   of stability in her life.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.580]   So unless there's a strong and clear need
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.480]   as to why you need to be traveling,
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.620]   then I would encourage you,
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.500]   skip the trip abroad during that time.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.860]   Now, just for some others in my audience,
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.860]   this clearly violates my discussions on birth tourism.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.740]   And this is, I think, the biggest downside of birth tourism
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.660]   is that if you go somewhere for the goal of having a baby,
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.380]   all of a sudden now you insert all kinds of uncertainty
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.260]   into the situation, which can have negative results.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.500]   So that's much easier, I think,
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.940]   for a mother who's had a baby before to do it.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.660]   Or if you're gonna do birth tourism,
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.660]   then you wanna have a clear reason you're doing it.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.580]   And if at all possible, you wanna be set up in advance.
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.000]   It's just much easier for a mother
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.080]   who has been through the process at least once, maybe twice.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.920]   Now, all of a sudden,
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.540]   her confidence level is very different.
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.780]   But if I were in your shoes
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.180]   and my wife were having her first baby,
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.100]   I'd just cancel the South Africa trip that year.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.180]   Stay home, take a car trip.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.900]   Go to Florida for the winter.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.860]   Go somewhere where it's easy.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.740]   You can get back and forth for prenatal appointments
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.640]   if you need to.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.940]   Take a shorter trip.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.900]   All those things are fine,
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.520]   but I would not go to South Africa for three months
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.420]   for the reasons that I've just stated.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.260]   - All right, Josh, thanks for the input.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.860]   - And thanks for calling back with a story.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.060]   We move on to Matthew in Florida.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:37.900]   Welcome to the show.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.340]   How can I serve you, Matthew?
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:45.300]   Matthew in Florida, go ahead.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.800]   - Yeah, sorry, just unmuting myself there.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:52.440]   So my question pertains to tithing.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.340]   And before I ask the question,
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:59.680]   I realized that tithing or tenting in the Christian tradition
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:04.220]   is a very prayerful thing that you should consider.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.780]   And I'm trying to put some quantitative reasoning
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.940]   behind a certain situation.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.740]   So I had a real estate investment project
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.640]   that went South and long story short,
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:26.780]   the bank took over the property and I'm out six figures.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:31.620]   And it kind of made me start thinking like,
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:36.620]   how do we tithe in respect to big gains and losses
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.980]   in investment versus our typical incomes
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.420]   that are coming in like W-2 or business income?
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.500]   And so I wanted to throw that out there
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.380]   and see what your thoughts were.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.500]   - I think the answer for someone who is convicted
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.940]   of his desire or responsibility to tithe
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.620]   from a biblical perspective,
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.780]   then I think the answer is relatively straightforward.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:07.300]   My understanding of the tithe would be that you tithe
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:12.300]   on the increase of your wealth in whatever form it is.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.940]   And so in the agrarian society of the Old Testament,
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.580]   then the tithe was when you harvested your crops,
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.060]   you gave a 10th of your tithe to the local temple
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.460]   to support the priests who were laboring there.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.540]   This was a pre-financial society.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:33.820]   In the New Testament, we start to see a society functioning
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.620]   in more of what we would recognize as something related
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.900]   to a modern financial system.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.740]   And we don't see the tithe working in exactly the same way
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.020]   because the priestly system has changed.
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.340]   And that's one of the reasons there's so much controversy
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.380]   around this issue among Christians
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.580]   who have different convictions,
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.500]   churches that have different teachings.
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.180]   But at its core, the tithe is based upon the increase.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:00.940]   And so how I would approach that is as you have wages,
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.940]   then you tithe on your wages.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.520]   As you have profits,
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.180]   then you tithe when you realize the profit.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.460]   So if you sell a piece of property,
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.380]   and at that point in time, you realize the profit,
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.620]   you realize the gain,
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.780]   then take a 10th of the gain and give that away.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.500]   If you sell a business and you realize the gain,
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.620]   then go ahead and take a 10th and give that away.
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.780]   So it's fairly straightforward that it should be done
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.020]   when you realize a profit.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.580]   I don't think you tithe on profits that are not realized.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.460]   So if your portfolio has increased enormously,
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.540]   but it's just sitting there,
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.380]   then I would not tithe on that.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.900]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.340]   You tithe on the increase or the gain,
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:47.340]   and when it's something that is like an investment,
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.580]   then you tithe when the gain is recognized.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:56.900]   - That makes sense.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.360]   I guess in the context of,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.860]   I'm not necessarily counting on that income to survive.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.860]   Obviously, I have other income,
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.060]   but as far as my investment portfolio,
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.620]   that's not in a "retirement" setting
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.860]   where I'm taking draws from it.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.500]   I guess would you view that as just like,
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.180]   hey, here's my bucket for later,
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.140]   and I'm gonna be harvesting later.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.620]   I'm not taking that for my needs now.
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:32.340]   No, no, I'm just trying to wrap my head around it.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.940]   - I would, and so that's why I used the word that I did.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.300]   I was very precise with my word.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.140]   I said, when you realize the gain,
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:44.140]   and so realizing a gain has a specific accounting meaning.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:47.460]   There's a difference between unrecognized gains,
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.340]   recognized gains, and realized gains.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.360]   So putting it simply, an unrecognized gain
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.780]   is what you have right now in your 401(k),
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.820]   meaning that, okay, I've put money in there,
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:03.820]   and it's growing, but it's not what's called recognized
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.120]   for tax purposes.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.700]   A recognized gain is when you have a gain,
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:13.260]   but for some reason you have to recognize it or report it,
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.860]   usually for tax purposes.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.900]   And so an example of this would be,
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.100]   let's say that you are going to convert
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.700]   from your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:27.380]   Well, you would recognize those gains in the traditional IRA
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:31.220]   as you convert them to a Roth IRA for tax purposes.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.140]   I'm just saying a realized gain
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.380]   is just simply money that you're receiving.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.820]   And so you can have realized gains that are recognized
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.180]   and recognized gains that are unrealized.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.380]   I'm using realized here just to mean
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.740]   when you actually get the money.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.220]   And I think this is in line with the basic spirit,
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.220]   which is when you receive the money
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.500]   and you have control of it,
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.260]   that would be the time at which
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.060]   I think it would be wise to pay a tithe.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.320]   So would I tithe on the increase of a 401(k) account?
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.260]   No, but when I take money out of the 401(k) account,
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.620]   that's when I would pay it.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.620]   - Yeah, that makes sense, you applied it.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.380]   I was over-complicating.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.940]   I always appreciate how you're able to take something
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.980]   and simplify it.
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.820]   So thank you, Joshua.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.220]   - My pleasure, anything else?
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.060]   - No, that's it for this week.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.300]   - Great, thank you very much.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.500]   We move on to the great state of New Jersey.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.420]   Welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.820]   - Hey, Joshua, can you hear me?
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.780]   - Yes, sounds good.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.900]   - Okay, perfect.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.740]   Well, I'm glad the last caller introduced
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.140]   the topic of apologetics.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.380]   I have a question for you,
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.860]   but really actually a couple of questions,
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.660]   really coming from the other side.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.460]   So I'm not a Christian,
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.100]   but I have lots of family who are in different denominations
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.820]   and even some non-denominational.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.260]   And one of the big challenges that we run into
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.780]   is around the issue of abortion.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:54.220]   And I understand that there's a general distaste for it
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.880]   in that community, but what I don't understand is,
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.040]   one, is there an explicit scriptural basis
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.960]   for rejecting abortion at any point?
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.520]   Second question is, if not,
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.820]   how do most Christians arrive
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.800]   at their conclusion about abortion?
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.060]   And third, does any of that change
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.680]   as we learn more about gestational development?
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.160]   So I'll leave that, I'll tee that up for you to answer.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.640]   And again, I really appreciate the way you think
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.720]   about these things, so I'll just, I'll leave it there.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.040]   - Absolutely, just if you're able to stay on the line,
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.800]   though, so we can go back and forth.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.480]   So the first question you asked was,
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   is there a specific scriptural kind of definition
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.440]   as to a specific point during pregnancy
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.000]   at which abortion would be disallowed, is that correct?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.280]   - Well, I guess more generally,
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.160]   any specific scriptural prohibition.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.680]   - Right, so I think there would be,
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.840]   the reason I'm trying to discern is to answer the question,
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   there would be two basic questions.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.460]   The first question would be, from a Christian perspective,
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:02.240]   is there a scriptural prohibition of abortion?
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.560]   And then the second question would be,
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.440]   is there a specific scriptural prohibition
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.880]   against abortion at a certain time?
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.220]   And this, I think, is the more applicable debate
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.800]   that happens in our society right now.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.360]   So do you have a question on both of them,
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.640]   or one or the other?
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.480]   - I guess both of them,
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.200]   I'd be curious to know the answer on.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.680]   But yeah, separating it that way makes sense.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   - Okay, so the first thing, let's deal with the first,
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.840]   actually, let's deal with the second,
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.400]   which makes more sense.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.880]   I guess we'll just deal with the first one,
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.460]   first and foremost.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:49.280]   I think, in fairness, while I do think
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.080]   this Bible teaches clearly about abortion,
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:58.080]   this is one of those topics that requires application.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.360]   And what I mean by that is,
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.320]   where I usually hear this would be Christians prohibition,
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.560]   when Christians prohibit homosexuality.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.400]   And people say, well,
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.640]   Jesus never talked about homosexuality.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.120]   And that's fair, that's true.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:16.760]   But to say that Christians should not be concerned
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.960]   about homosexuality,
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.720]   because Jesus did not talk about homosexuality,
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.200]   is to demonstrate ignorance
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.760]   of how Christians derive their theology,
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.520]   and the applications of theology.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.160]   So there are lots and lots of things
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.400]   that are not written in red letters in the New Testament
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.920]   that Jesus specifically talked about.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:41.840]   Everything from slavery, to abortion, to sex trafficking,
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.880]   to rape, to all kinds of things.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.920]   I mean, we could go down the list of all kinds of sins,
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.180]   things that you being a non-Christian,
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.160]   and I being a Christian,
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.520]   would wholeheartedly agree with one another.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.200]   This is absolutely wrong.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.240]   This is absolutely prohibited.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.120]   And yet, we would have to acknowledge
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:02.080]   that Jesus specifically did not speak about them.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.540]   So that's one thing that is important.
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.120]   And this does come up sometimes in abortion,
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.160]   because people say, well, Jesus didn't talk about abortion.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.360]   And you have to quick to say, that is correct.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.760]   Jesus did not talk about abortion.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.400]   Now, to understand this,
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.180]   Christians generally derive their theology
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.800]   from the fullness, the full breadth of Scripture.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.680]   Across Christendom, there are differences
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.920]   in what Christians consider to be the canon of Scripture.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.640]   Protestants generally recognize the 66 books
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.260]   of the Old and New Testament that are most well-known.
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.360]   Roman Catholics have a few additional
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.940]   that we'd label the Apocrypha.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.040]   Orthodox Christians have a few additional.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.140]   And so there's some variation, but generally speaking,
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:51.260]   Christians affirm that all of these writings are inspired.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.680]   That's why they have been collected
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.000]   to be the canon of Scripture.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.760]   There were other writings that are ancient
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.080]   that were rejected by early councils of the Church,
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.140]   but the books that we bring together,
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.840]   we consider these all to be authoritative.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.560]   And so you'll find, and then the Scriptures themselves
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.240]   are self-referential.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.640]   And so, for example, there's a verse in Timothy
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.520]   in the New Testament, a letter that the Apostle Paul
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.800]   is writing to his disciple Timothy,
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.040]   a young man that he is training.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.060]   And he says, "All Scripture is God-breathed
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.060]   "and useful for correction and for teaching
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.720]   "and for all the rest of it."
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.640]   And what he's referring to there is, of course,
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.240]   the Hebrew Bible, that's what he's referring to.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.800]   And he's specifically saying that it will be
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.240]   the Hebrew Bible, that this is inspired.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.160]   And then based upon that, other Christians
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.520]   in the early Church have gone on and gathered together
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.280]   the writings that are in the New Testament
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.080]   and affirmed, these are the reliable
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.920]   and inspired Scriptures.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.920]   Now, in addition to that, you should also understand
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.920]   that some Christians believe that not all Christian doctrine
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:08.840]   has to be drawn exclusively from the Bible itself,
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.300]   from the writings, from the written Scriptures itself.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:16.040]   This, most famously, was one of the major divisions
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.060]   in the Protestant Reformation.
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:21.140]   So 500 years ago, in the Protestant Reformation,
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:25.920]   the early Reformers created the five solas.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.620]   And one of the five solas that they kind of staked
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.880]   their claim on created Protestant Christianity,
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.000]   which is probably what mostly surrounds you.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.320]   But Protestant Christianity was built upon,
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.060]   one of the basic ideas is that of sola scriptura,
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.200]   so that the Scripture alone is the ultimate
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   source of authority.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.840]   But the reason that there was a schism there
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.680]   between Protestants, as they're known now,
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.660]   and Roman Catholics is because in the Roman Catholic
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:59.660]   tradition, Scripture is not the sole source of authority.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.400]   And so Roman Catholics would acknowledge Church tradition
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.800]   and Church authority as being also authoritative
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   over the doctrine of the Church and the doctrine
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.780]   that Christians live by.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:21.700]   So for example, a Roman Catholic in the papal encyclical,
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.500]   I forget what it was called, I read it,
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.240]   but an example would be birth control, right?
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.540]   Roman Catholic theology and dogma teaches
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:34.540]   that married couples should not use physical
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.220]   or chemical means of avoiding, physical barrier
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.720]   or chemical means of avoiding children.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.680]   That is the official teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.100]   That is not a teaching that is based,
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.820]   that is not a teaching that you can find
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.080]   in black and white letter in the Bible.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.580]   You can find hints of it, you can find traces of it,
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.460]   and for that reason, the Roman Catholic Pope
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.460]   wrote that encyclical and why that became Church doctrine.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:06.340]   But that is not a black and white thing.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.740]   There is no verse that says thou shalt not
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.580]   use birth control.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.240]   So tradition and Church authority are also valid,
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.160]   also in the Orthodox Church.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.940]   In Protestantism itself, this will be a big dividing point.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.220]   So Jesus himself said, he said, "It's good for you
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.920]   "that I go away, because if I don't go,
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.620]   "then the Comforter will not come.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.920]   "But when he comes, he shall take all of the things of mine
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.420]   "and teach them to you."
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.760]   And so in Protestant Christianity,
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   many Protestants don't affirm the sole and exclusive
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.620]   teaching of Scripture as being everything.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.260]   Many Protestants would believe that the Holy Spirit
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.780]   is teaching us, because that is what Jesus said.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.780]   And so I myself would affirm this,
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.160]   that I would say that the Holy Spirit will teach you
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.300]   or will teach me something that I need to know.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.100]   And I will never contradict Scripture.
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:04.360]   I will never go to Scripture and say,
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.080]   "Hey, look, in black and white it says this is wrong,
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.460]   "but the Holy Spirit is telling me
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.480]   "with my personalized revelation that I should do it."
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.800]   I think that is wrong, but you can in many ways
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.680]   have expanded application of a principle
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.760]   that you see in Scripture in your own life.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.240]   And I'll give you one specific example, okay?
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.800]   I'm a rather, this is silly,
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.560]   and I'm trying to use examples that would make this simple,
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.740]   that would make this clear.
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:35.740]   I'm a somewhat large guy, and throughout my life,
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.460]   I've generally been in the habit
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.040]   of keeping my shirt buttons open
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.520]   because of the largeness of my frame.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.480]   When I was in high school and had a uniform,
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.020]   it just wasn't comfortable to button it all the way up.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.800]   And one time I was in my early 20s,
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.480]   and I was looking at myself in the mirror,
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.680]   and the top button of my shirt was unbuttoned,
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.120]   and I was showing all this chest hair,
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.720]   and I looked at myself and I said, "Joshua,"
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.600]   and I just sensed, in my heart,
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.840]   I just sensed a conviction that that's not the image
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.480]   that you should be portraying.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.720]   That's not modest, button your shirt.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:12.720]   Now, that kind of conviction would be something
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.160]   that many Christians experience and say,
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.180]   I claim that I've experienced this.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.800]   I sensed what I would label
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.260]   as the voice of the Holy Spirit saying,
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.720]   "Joshua, this is an immodest behavior."
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.720]   But I would never go out and put that in black and white
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.620]   and say to someone else,
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.560]   "Well, you can't unbutton your shirt."
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.360]   I wouldn't create an encyclical that says,
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.560]   "You can't do this."
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:38.560]   It's just a, there's a biblical doctrine of modesty,
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.320]   and I wanna apply it, and in that moment,
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.280]   I was applying it with my physical experience.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.280]   And then there would be similar expressions of,
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.320]   you would have a biblical doctrine of modesty.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.640]   So, for example, in the New Testament,
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.240]   Paul writes to women, and he says,
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.980]   "I want women to be adorned with the beauty
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.180]   "that comes from the inside,
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.180]   "not with costly gold and expensive apparel
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.400]   "and braided hair and all of these things."
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.620]   So, different Christians take that in different ways,
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.800]   and they make different applications of it.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   And so, you may have a very conservative Mennonite group
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:17.860]   that where the Christians in that group
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.000]   never ever wear earrings,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.580]   they never wear any kind of jewelry,
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.860]   they never wear makeup, they never do anything,
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.800]   because they are very fundamentalist
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.840]   in following the specific dictates
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.100]   of that passage of Scripture.
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.940]   Then you'll have other groups that are less focused
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:38.780]   on the specific application of don't wear costly jewels,
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.980]   and instead focused on applying the spirit of it,
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.780]   the spirit of the idea.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:48.780]   And so, this would be kind of where I would be.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.040]   So, I gave my wife a pair of earrings for,
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.460]   I don't know, some present in the past,
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.020]   but I don't wanna go around
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.960]   and see how much wealth can I display on her.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.500]   And in my own expression,
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.500]   I want, even though that was written to women,
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.620]   specifically by the Apostle Paul,
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:05.620]   I take that as applying to me as well,
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.620]   as a Christian virtue of modesty.
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.180]   And so, I want to be modest.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.540]   I wanna be modest in my speech,
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.220]   I wanna be modest in my appearance,
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.620]   I wanna be modest in my expression,
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.840]   I don't wanna go around
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.420]   and just talk about myself all the time,
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.380]   I don't wanna wear things
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.620]   that are constantly gonna bring attention to myself,
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.900]   I wanna express this virtue of modesty,
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.420]   but I wanna do it in a thoughtful way.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:31.420]   So, that's a preamble to say that as we go to Scripture,
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.660]   you need to understand where doctrine comes from,
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.360]   and that I could wholeheartedly,
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:43.580]   you can make the argument against a certain thing,
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.940]   such as abortion,
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.580]   without specifically going to chapter and verse,
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:51.820]   and specifically identifying this one thing,
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.300]   and still be perfectly correct within Christian doctrine.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.660]   And each tradition or stream of Christianity
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.020]   would have a slightly different way of looking at it.
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:03.100]   And so, if you don't understand that,
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.580]   you just look ignorant when you say,
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:05.900]   well, show me chapter and verse on that,
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.060]   show me chapter and verse, Joshua,
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.300]   as to why you think you should
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.000]   button the top button of your shirt.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.100]   It just makes you look ignorant
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.260]   that you don't understand how we derive doctrine
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.300]   in what we do.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.260]   Now, there's one more thing that you need to understand,
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.340]   is that if you go to Scripture itself,
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.660]   I think it's fairly common,
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.620]   I'm not saying anything controversial here,
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:28.220]   most Christians would agree that what you see in...
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.860]   So, in our modern world,
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.660]   in the United States and in England and various other places,
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.020]   we have a tradition of what is called common law.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:37.820]   Common law is different than a civil law tradition.
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.500]   So, the difference between England and France
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.540]   is you have a distinction between common law and civil law,
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.140]   difference between the United States and...
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.500]   Anyway, you have a difference between
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.740]   common law and civil law countries.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.140]   I don't remember which country has every single one.
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.540]   But in the English-speaking world,
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.200]   common law is the basic application.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.340]   What that means is there's not so much a focus
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.780]   on a specific set of laws
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:05.140]   that are written down by a government,
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.500]   and that these are all of the laws,
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.960]   but rather we draw our legal system
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.180]   from the laws that have gone on before.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.820]   And when something has gone on before,
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:19.380]   then you see an application of it.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.700]   And so, in the U.S. tradition,
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.100]   we have a written constitution.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.260]   That would be different than in England.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.700]   But we have a written constitution,
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.140]   and then you have application of that.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:29.380]   You have case law.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:31.700]   And that case law is an expansion
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.100]   of the law that has come before.
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.540]   Now, I'm not a legal scholar.
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.660]   I would say, though, that certainly,
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.260]   this is the same basic system
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:41.740]   that you see in the Bible itself.
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.380]   And then I think you could say,
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.020]   I would guess that probably the common law tradition
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:50.780]   comes out of Christianity, that we draw it from that.
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.460]   And so, if you go back and you study
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:56.040]   the most detailed civil laws that we have in the Bible,
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.780]   coming from the Mosaic Civil Code,
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.720]   I'm persuaded that this is a system of case law.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.420]   You have a basic law.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.640]   For example, you could bring it together
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.820]   with just the Ten Commandments.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.420]   Here's the basic Ten Commandments.
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.780]   But then you have many, many applications of that case law,
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.900]   of expressions of it, of bringing it into more focus,
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.060]   and what about this situation?
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.300]   What about that situation?
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.400]   And it expands throughout history.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.300]   So, the simplest reason that Christians
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:26.300]   would be opposed to abortion
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:31.700]   is because of the biblical prohibition of murder.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:34.380]   Thou shalt not murder is one of the most
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:37.780]   fundamental aspects of biblical law.
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.020]   Thou shalt not murder is clearly stated
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.620]   in the Ten Commandments.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.900]   But prior to that, in the Noahic Covenant,
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.180]   you have God clearly saying, don't murder.
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.740]   And if a man takes another man's life,
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.540]   then his life is to be forfeit.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.060]   He should be executed if he takes another man's life.
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:55.180]   Murder is one of the first sins that's recorded in the Bible
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.740]   between Cain and Abel.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.940]   And from the beginning to the end of scripture,
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.460]   we have a prohibition against murder.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.980]   Now, there are applications of that.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.940]   What is murder?
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.940]   The reason we have the different distinction
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.780]   between murder and manslaughter
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:10.900]   is because of the biblical distinction
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:13.160]   between murder and killing,
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.300]   where we clearly see application of this.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:19.140]   But no other verse is necessary
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:24.980]   for being opposed to abortion
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:26.780]   other than thou shalt not murder,
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:31.540]   the fundamental, foundational, basic ethic
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:34.940]   of any ethical system.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:39.820]   So we'll go to a couple more examples in a moment,
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.340]   but I'm answering question one to say,
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.820]   why would a Christian oppose abortion?
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:47.260]   Well, because Christians believe that abortion is murder,
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:49.620]   and the Bible says thou shalt not murder.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.060]   So then we get to the second question.
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.060]   We would say, all right, well, is there a point in time
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.100]   at which it would be murder
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.860]   and a point in time at which it would not be murder?
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.220]   So let's say that I have a baby,
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.660]   and here's where I just ask you
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.740]   if you're willing to share your perspective.
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.980]   Let's say I have a week-old baby,
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.540]   and I intentionally end the life of that baby
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.380]   a week after he has been from his mother's womb.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.100]   Would you call that murder
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.100]   if I did that to a week-old baby yourself
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:17.940]   at where you are right now?
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.060]   - Yes. - Okay.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.860]   And if it were a week prior to the birth of the child,
[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.700]   would you call it murder if I ended the life of the baby?
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:29.300]   - I think I would, yeah.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.980]   - Okay, so good.
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:33.020]   So not all people would agree with you,
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.140]   because many people have tried
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:36.820]   to come up with different theories.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.300]   So I think, I don't know if he's still,
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.020]   he doesn't seem as popular as he once was,
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.540]   but I once read some of Peter Singer's writing on this
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:48.020]   where he talked about basically we should not,
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.180]   that, what was his argument?
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.100]   You're getting me on the spot.
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:54.900]   So you get what I can do just extemporaneously,
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.980]   but Peter Singer talked about basically
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:00.580]   that in order for a baby to,
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:03.060]   in order for murder to be,
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.860]   in order for the ending of life
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:08.260]   of a young human being to be murder,
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:11.180]   the human being would have to have personhood.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:14.740]   And he did not believe that personhood was an attribute
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:17.940]   that a baby could express prior to, I forget his number,
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.780]   but maybe two or three years old.
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.660]   And so we get into the question of personhood,
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.700]   which is the fundamental debate philosophically
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.460]   as the difference between ending life of a human
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.980]   as compared to murdering a person.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.900]   It's based upon personhood.
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:35.100]   So he said that because he didn't see much of a distinction
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.820]   between a baby at 39 weeks of gestation
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:41.060]   as compared to a baby at 41 weeks of gestation.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:44.220]   And it's interesting that when you have a baby,
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:49.220]   the first, in some literature related to childbirthing,
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.100]   you have the concept of the first trimester,
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.980]   the second trimester, the third trimester,
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:55.420]   and the fourth trimester.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.900]   And so the fourth trimester is the first few months,
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.900]   first three months of a baby's life
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:05.060]   in which the baby has been delivered from his mother's womb,
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:08.620]   but in many ways, he still has a very similar experience
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:11.380]   outside of the womb as he had inside the womb.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:14.740]   There's a lot more similarity between a baby
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:18.060]   that's two-month-old with a 32-week baby
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:22.380]   as compared to a two-month-old with a six-month-old baby.
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.900]   They're just wildly different in terms of their development.
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.980]   And so you could say, well, maybe the,
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:32.980]   and many people say abortion is the ending of human life
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:38.380]   prior to the physical delivering of the baby.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:41.140]   Well, if you apply your reasonable thinking to that,
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.080]   it's hard to draw that line.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.940]   It's hard to say that there's a big difference
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:48.980]   between a baby at 39 weeks of gestation
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.860]   versus a baby who was delivered at 40 weeks
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.220]   and is one week old.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:56.500]   Both of them will die if left alone.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.740]   So we can't say that personhood comes
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.180]   when you can take care of yourself.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:04.980]   A six-year-old child will die if left alone in most cases.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:07.820]   So we can't use a criteria of saying
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.860]   that the child has to be able to take care of himself.
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.020]   And physically speaking, then we say,
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.860]   well, maybe it's 'cause the baby can survive
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:15.900]   outside of his mother's womb.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.100]   Well, at 39 weeks, then the baby can survive
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.420]   outside of his mother's womb, no big deal, fully formed,
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.820]   everything's good to go, just like at 41 weeks.
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:24.340]   There's no material difference there.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:27.060]   So then we say, well, then the difference of personhood
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:28.980]   or whether abortion is wrong or not
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:31.140]   is just based upon the location of the baby.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.860]   The baby is located inside the baby's,
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:36.540]   the mother's body or outside of the mother's body.
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:37.980]   And some people believe that,
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:40.380]   but I think that if you examine that really carefully,
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.740]   it starts to break down.
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:45.140]   And so then we have to move earlier in the pregnancy
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:48.980]   and we have to find some other basis of it.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:51.580]   So this is where there's been such a big difference
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:54.460]   with two things, number one, ultrasound technology,
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.820]   where we can see the development of the baby.
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:00.620]   We can see the point at which a zygote and an embryo
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.740]   and a fetus start to resemble what we would recognize
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:05.420]   as a baby versus before that.
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:08.020]   And we're pretty astonished to see how early that happens.
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.900]   It's really remarkable when you start getting ultrasounds
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.220]   at 20 weeks and you see your baby there formed,
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.340]   it's just, it's astonishing to see it.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:17.900]   And then the second thing is our ability to provide
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:23.580]   pre, forgetting the name of it, but the NICU,
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:25.980]   for a very premature baby,
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.900]   provide life-giving care for a preemie baby.
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.020]   And if you have a very premature baby,
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.820]   I mean, certainly the statistics change a lot,
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.700]   but you move all the way back to,
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:39.740]   you move all the way back to 25 weeks
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.460]   and you might get decent survival rates for a baby
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:43.540]   with medical care.
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:45.580]   And so those arguments just don't seem
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:48.260]   like they're philosophically consistent.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:50.980]   What's the difference between 25 weeks and 27 weeks?
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:52.620]   And you go back to Roe v. Wade
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:55.740]   and kind of this creation of this trimester system,
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.820]   and it just seems philosophically inconsistent.
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.620]   So the two, so I think what often Christians look at
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.220]   is they go back and they say,
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:09.160]   at what point in time is the baby a separate entity?
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.580]   And it took quite a while for there to be
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:16.460]   the broad agreement that there is now among many Christians,
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.020]   but basically the point in time
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:21.180]   at which the baby is a separate entity is at fertilization.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:23.780]   The time at which there is a unique DNA
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:25.420]   that is different from the DNA of the mother
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:28.680]   and of the father basically is fertilization.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.220]   That's the point in time.
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:33.140]   And then there is scriptural evidence
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:36.200]   that could be pointed to to indicate this
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.080]   from a theological basis.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:42.460]   So probably some of the famous verses in Psalms,
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:46.320]   the writer of Psalms says that you knitted me together
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.020]   in my mother's womb,
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:49.900]   and I'm fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.820]   There's a verse in Jeremiah that says,
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:54.780]   before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:55.820]   So let me repeat that.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:59.820]   Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you,
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:03.140]   and before you were born, I consecrated you.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:06.660]   And then you can go through and,
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:10.340]   I mean, there are other applications of that
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.540]   that you can find.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.580]   And there's, I can't cite chapter and verse at the moment
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:16.300]   extemporaneously, but we can go back
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.300]   and there were laws in the Mosaic law
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.860]   about striking a woman who is pregnant
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.140]   and what happens there.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.100]   And so there's clearly an acknowledgement
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.900]   that there is a, that God is involved
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:33.460]   in the forming together of life in the womb.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:38.300]   So the primary doctrine is thou shalt not murder.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.180]   And then secondarily, in addition to those verses
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.180]   that talk about God's knowledge of the baby,
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:47.540]   there is a clear, consistent theme in scripture
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:50.860]   that God himself is the author of life.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:55.860]   And it's not necessary to deny that a male and a female
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:00.880]   through sexual copulation are involved in that process
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.540]   in order to affirm that.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.580]   The scripture clearly teaches that God
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.540]   is the author of life, not independent
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:11.780]   of a man and woman's activities, but together with them.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.980]   And so we see throughout the Bible,
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.020]   there's basically an uninterrupted theme
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.300]   from the beginning to the end that God opens the womb
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.060]   and God closes the womb.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.900]   And so if you bring these various strains together,
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.800]   you arrive at the modern Christian conviction.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.620]   You arrive at the modern Christian conviction
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:33.420]   that life begins at conception,
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:37.500]   that God is involved in the actual giving of life,
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.480]   and life begins at conception primarily
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.620]   because where else can it be placed?
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:45.900]   And as we have increasing levels of scientific evidence,
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.480]   then that argument has been easier for Christians to make
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.980]   because now we have scientific evidence
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.300]   that supports what, in many cases,
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.820]   is a theological conviction.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.940]   Let me add two more things,
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.220]   and then I'll just stop for your comments.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.220]   There's two more things
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.820]   that are associated with this, though.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:07.260]   The other theme that is really important doctrinally
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:12.260]   is that Christians value persons, they value people.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.940]   And one of the most consistent expressions
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.540]   of the Christian religion
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.700]   has been to care for those who are unwanted.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.460]   Christians are clearly commanded multiple times
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:26.360]   to care for widows and especially orphans,
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.660]   that providing care for orphans
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:32.400]   is a fundamental basis of Christian religion.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.340]   If you went back to the early Christians
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.700]   in the Roman Empire at that time,
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.340]   abortion, safe methods of abortion, were not common.
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.820]   And so it's my understanding of history
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:44.140]   that in the Romans, it would be very frequent
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.920]   that they would go ahead, the baby would be birthed,
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.620]   but then the baby would just be set aside on the trash heap.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.980]   And it's my understanding that Christians would go out
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.640]   and regularly work through the trash heap
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.820]   finding abandoned babies, and they would take those babies,
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.820]   they would adopt them, and they would raise them.
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.620]   And this has been the same thing
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.140]   that Christians have done all around the world
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.800]   in many places, is that anytime a baby is unwanted
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.060]   or abandoned, then Christians go and adopt the baby
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:14.500]   because we have to, it's a fundamental commandment
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.460]   of our Maker that we are to care for orphans.
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.660]   And then you say, well, all right, that's fine,
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.220]   but why would there be a society,
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.540]   why would somebody not want a baby?
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.860]   And this is where you get to other aspects of sin
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.740]   that often what Christians deal with.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.760]   If you look at the reasons that people abort their babies,
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.240]   generally speaking, can I speak generally?
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.540]   This is non-inclusively, but many of the reasons
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:43.240]   that a mother would abort her baby
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.600]   would be related to some expression of sin.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.720]   Sometimes it would be sexual sin.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:54.720]   In some cases, a young mother was engaging
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.920]   in sexual relations with a man, and they weren't married,
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.120]   and they were fornicating, and now there's a baby,
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.720]   and I don't want the baby, and the baby's inconvenient.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.920]   In many cases, it would be due to sins of greed
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:11.340]   and sins of, I mean, I just label it as greed.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.920]   If you look at the pro-abortion folks today
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.240]   and you listen to their arguments,
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.560]   their basic argument in many cases,
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.200]   when you go back to a couple years ago,
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.440]   there was the shout your abortion,
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.520]   and I listened to all these testimonies of women
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.760]   who were talking about their abortions.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.760]   The basic theme as to why these women
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.080]   would kill their babies was that the baby
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.060]   was an inconvenience to my career.
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.920]   The baby was gonna keep me from making more money.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.040]   The baby was gonna keep me from doing better financially,
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.840]   and this is repulsive.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.760]   This kind of thinking is repulsive to the Christian mind.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.760]   To put money in front of a person who needs you
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:53.520]   is repulsive, and then you look at the societal expressions,
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.280]   and there's all kinds of just practical expressions of it.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:00.000]   So it's the totality of all of those things
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.360]   that is based upon it, and I should also note
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.920]   that if you look at the arguments
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:09.460]   of pro-abortion activists or proponents,
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:10.960]   basically, then you have to deal
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.480]   with the philosophical arguments for autonomy.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.880]   That's one of the basic philosophical arguments
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.080]   in favor of a woman being able to abort her baby
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.400]   at any time for any reason whatsoever.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.240]   It's autonomy.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.400]   I can do what I want, and autonomy,
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.000]   this kind of extreme form of autonomy
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.920]   is not a Christian virtue or a Christian philosophy,
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.520]   and I'll skip that discussion for the moment,
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:41.280]   but those are kind of some of the many reasons
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.580]   as to why you have such a strong Christian support
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:48.040]   for abolishing abortion in all of its forms.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.000]   - Okay, I'm gonna need to go back
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.940]   to listen to digest all of that.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.780]   - You'll be both.
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.240]   - Yeah, well, first, I wanna say thank you
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.680]   for going to such lengths.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.060]   This is a topic that, as I said in the beginning,
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.340]   it's difficult to speak with Christians about
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.040]   because I often run into the scenario
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.800]   where it's kind of like a moral dumbfounding.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.680]   Like, what do you mean?
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.760]   What do you mean, why is it wrong?
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.200]   It's wrong because it's wrong.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.600]   Okay, well, let's go a little deeper than that
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.400]   and try to understand what the motives are here.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.480]   So I appreciate you taking the topic on
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.760]   and sharing your beliefs.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.800]   It's really helpful for me to understand.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.200]   We could probably fill out the rest of your show
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.000]   talking about this, so I wanna respect
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.680]   the rest of your listeners.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.560]   And I guess my, in conclusion,
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.560]   my concern is that things like complete prohibitions
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.720]   on mostly anything tend to ignore
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.280]   the consequences of those prohibitions.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.680]   So abortions that are performed illegally
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.400]   with less than sterile techniques
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.800]   for, let's say, medically necessary reasons,
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   those stories get pushed down and not paid attention to
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.600]   in favor of the, oh, well, she sinned,
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.040]   and so, therefore, she was wrong,
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.280]   so she deserves whatever she gets.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.040]   That's my concern, is really about
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.520]   the total prohibition on anything.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.540]   And I think that if we,
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:18.200]   I guess, in conclusion,
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.080]   I would have one final question.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.140]   Is there a point of compromise
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.800]   that you think Christians and non-Christians
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.440]   could make on abortion at any point in the future,
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.280]   or will abortion at any point,
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.040]   let's say, beginning at conception,
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.500]   always and forever be considered a sin
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.780]   and, therefore, rallied against politically?
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.660]   - Fair questions.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.120]   - Can there be any compromise?
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.360]   - And, well, we're not gonna do two hours on this.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.960]   Any listener who wants to skip this
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.000]   has a skip button and a fast-forward button.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.560]   So I'm more interested in two thoughtful men
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.840]   who care about these issues
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.800]   and wanna deal with them in a straightforward way.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.260]   I'm more interested in our having
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:02.600]   a productive conversation, and I pay for the hosting.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.740]   Anyone who wants to skip can skip.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.520]   I feel that one of the great problems
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.000]   that we face in our society is that
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   when these important and heavy and difficult
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.520]   moral issues are dealt with,
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.120]   people try to deal with them too quickly,
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.240]   and these are difficult things.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:26.320]   So in terms of, first, I think that it's important
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.560]   for anybody who is, I guess one thing
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.440]   that I found really helpful is the time
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:36.440]   at which I was fully able to empathize
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.740]   with a mother who aborts her baby.
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.720]   And I'll tell you specifically where that happened.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.440]   My wife used to watch this show called "Call the Midwife."
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.920]   She got interested in it.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.480]   And there was a scene in "Call the Midwife,"
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.880]   or various scenes, in which it was dealing
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.560]   with this direct topic.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.340]   And it was clearly, the writer of the show
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:00.760]   was clearly doing it to get at the coat hanger issue
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.760]   that you're specifically dealing with.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.560]   But the writer of the show, at the time,
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.640]   abortion was prohibited in England.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.120]   The show was set in England.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:13.120]   And there was this very poor mother with many children,
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.720]   and this very poor mother with many, many children
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.320]   became pregnant again, and she couldn't care
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.820]   for the children that she had.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:25.800]   And the show writers wrote her in a situation
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.400]   where she felt like she had no other option.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.720]   And so she went, and she obtained a back alley abortion.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.120]   And I don't remember if she, I think she lived,
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.400]   but it was very severe, and she was going to die,
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.000]   and who knows.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.560]   But it was that time in which I was filled with empathy.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.040]   And I'm really glad that I saw that,
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.200]   because it seems like I have to go through experiences
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.240]   for me to have empathy with people.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.760]   And when I have empathy, I'm able to be more,
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:58.440]   I'm able to face things more straightforwardly.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:02.260]   At its core, though, empathy, or kind of a toxic form
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.020]   of empathy, can't be our beginning place in anything,
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.160]   because we can empathize all the way
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.680]   to the greatest moral evil you would ever imagine,
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.000]   purely from empathy perspectives.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.840]   So we need to begin by using our rational brains
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.680]   and thinking about things logically,
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.140]   and then make sure that we have dealt
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.280]   with the emotions appropriately,
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.000]   and that we're genuinely actually providing care
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.560]   for the people involved.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.440]   And what I find is that in the difficult cases,
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.640]   usually, so the difficult cases are actually much simpler
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:43.040]   if we begin with a logical argument,
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.560]   and then we move then to how do we do this
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.920]   in an appropriate way?
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.180]   So you mentioned difficult situations,
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.600]   and then you talked about people dying
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:59.200]   with illegal abortion procedures and things like that.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.400]   So first, let's deal with, or straightforwardly,
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.280]   let's deal with the most common objections,
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:10.280]   which are rape, incest, and abortion necessary
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.480]   because of the life of the mother,
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.720]   where there's a danger to the life of the mother.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.160]   If we look at these logically, I'll just give you my case,
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:21.160]   is that if we assign personhood to a baby,
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.560]   and personhood is a philosophical term,
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.600]   basically, we mean that I have rights, you have rights,
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.080]   the father has rights, the mother has rights,
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.640]   and the baby has rights, these are persons,
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.320]   and we're going to treat the baby
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.220]   as a human being with human rights.
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.460]   If we do that, and then just follow
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.720]   that train of logic forward,
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:44.520]   then we have everything that we need
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.680]   to resolve those three most commonly cited
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.640]   situations and arrangements.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.360]   There are two separate trains.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.240]   So if a baby is conceived in rape,
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.760]   or a baby is conceived as a product of incest,
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.360]   then in that situation, we need to understand
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:09.360]   that the only morally righteous person involved is the baby.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:14.620]   The baby is the only innocent party.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:16.160]   Excuse me, in the case of rape,
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.960]   I'm not trying to say that the mother is not innocent.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.060]   What I'm saying is that the baby
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:25.640]   is the most obviously truly innocent person.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:30.600]   So what we have in the case of rape or incest,
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.400]   and a baby conceived in rape or incest,
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.560]   is we have multiple moral agents.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.500]   In the case of rape, the guilty party is the father.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:45.520]   The mother may or may not bear some responsibility,
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.840]   but let's assume that she's totally innocent.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.160]   The baby is also totally innocent.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   And we don't right moral wrongs with more moral wrongs.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:01.600]   So if I come and I murder your brother,
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:08.600]   we don't right the wrong of my murdering your brother
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.360]   by you going and murdering my mother.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.300]   We know that.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.920]   We know that while it might feel good to kill someone else,
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.280]   and it might give some kind of vengeance,
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.760]   it doesn't solve the moral wrong.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.640]   And so the same thing that happens in rape,
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:26.160]   the morally guilty party is the rapist.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.960]   That's whose life should be forfeit.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.720]   The baby is the truly innocent party.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.400]   And then you get to, well, what I commonly hear
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.320]   if I talk to someone, well, you don't want a mother
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.920]   to see the face of her rapist for the rest of her life.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:45.360]   If you read the stories of mothers who have faced that,
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:50.360]   in some cases, the baby himself or herself winds up
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:53.520]   being an important part of her healing from the trauma
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.280]   of this great evil that was committed against her.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.320]   In some cases, the baby can be adopted.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:04.080]   But in no case is the moral evil of rape made right
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.280]   by murdering the innocent baby.
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.960]   Similar with incest, same basic thought process applies,
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.680]   is that the baby is the innocent party.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.920]   And we should not go out and murder innocent people
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.840]   just because other people commit great wrongs
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.260]   and great evils.
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:23.160]   With regard to life of the mother,
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.340]   if we ascribe personhood to the baby and to the mother,
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.320]   then we have a proper moral framework
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.120]   in which to deal with difficult situations.
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.240]   We know how to triage situations.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.520]   What happens in abortion is that if a mother's life
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.120]   is in danger, then we automatically assume
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:45.760]   that the right answer to that is the death of the baby.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.920]   That's not always a right assumption.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.800]   It's my understanding, I'm not a medical doctor,
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.400]   and this could be wrong, but I think it's right.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.800]   I am not aware of any medical procedure
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:00.800]   that would require us to intentionally end the life
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:06.060]   of a developing fetus in order to save the life of a mother.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:07.720]   There may be many circumstances
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.240]   in which the baby must be delivered.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.280]   The mother is experiencing preeclampsia
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.960]   or some potentially life-ending disease.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.920]   We may need to deliver the baby.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.480]   And clearly, we may deliver the baby
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.680]   knowing that the baby will die.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.600]   If the baby is very young, we know that the baby will die.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.760]   But we don't need to take active steps to kill the baby
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.640]   before delivering the baby.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.240]   And that's the difference between abortion
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.660]   versus a medical triage situation
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.380]   in which we're weighing the balance of two important lives,
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:41.960]   the mother and the baby, and we're doing our best
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.920]   that both of them would be alive.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.960]   But in many cases, we know that the baby may die
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.880]   because the baby is not fully developed
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.940]   and we have to protect the life of the mother.
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.440]   So if we just describe personhood,
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.040]   then we know how to deal with this.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.840]   We know morally that when there's a great accident,
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:59.340]   an airplane accident or a great war,
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.540]   we know morally when we go out on the battlefield
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:05.000]   that you might be a one and you might be a three,
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.320]   and we're gonna first take all the ones and the twos,
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.160]   and if you're still alive when we get to the threes,
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.240]   you might make it.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:14.160]   But when the guy going around triaging all of the casualties
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.120]   is riding on your face with a Sharpie and he rides a three,
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.200]   he knows that you're probably gonna be dead.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.160]   So we can deal with those things morally speaking.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.800]   Now, in terms of what about if,
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.640]   is a woman just going to abort her baby and be,
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.560]   let's say that abortion were made illegal.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.720]   Let's say that guys in my camp
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.360]   who want to abolish human abortion win,
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.400]   and it becomes the law of the land
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.060]   at which abortion by any means or mechanism,
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.160]   be it physical, chemical,
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.360]   at any stage of pregnancy is made illegal.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.040]   Are people still going to abort their babies?
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:53.880]   They might.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.100]   Human history would indicate that at the end of the day,
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:01.400]   if anybody wants a baby to die, then we can do that.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.140]   The basic reason we kill babies
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:04.840]   is they can't defend themselves.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.440]   And so our, just like Bill Maher last week,
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.240]   Bill Maher's comments that made the news.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.360]   It's like, okay, I can see that it's murder
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.800]   and I'm kind of okay with that.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.160]   The reason we murder babies
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.520]   is they have no means of self-defense.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.320]   And if they did, then we wouldn't murder them.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.080]   So it calls on those of us who do have a means
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.400]   of imposing our will on other people
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.520]   for morally righteous reasons to do so.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.920]   And we have to be those who defend the babies.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:36.040]   But at the end of the day, we're not going to end murder
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.600]   just by making murder illegal.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.000]   As far as I know, murder is illegal everywhere in the world.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.320]   And as far as I know, people still murder one another.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.520]   But that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be done.
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.960]   That doesn't mean that it shouldn't be done.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:52.000]   If an action is immoral, and that's a big if,
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   but if I'm right and abortion is an immoral act always,
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.440]   then it would not be a problem for there to be a law
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.320]   that prohibits an immoral act.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:06.760]   And law has multiple functions.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:12.720]   One function of law is a practical outworking of law.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.680]   But another function of law is to simply send a signal,
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.480]   send a moral signal.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.360]   So for example, I think,
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.480]   although I would have to go and check state by state,
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.960]   and I don't know, but why is suicide a crime?
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.320]   Well, it seems like the dumbest crime in the world.
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.400]   After all, the dude's dead.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.600]   You're gonna make it illegal for him to commit suicide?
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.360]   It's the dumbest thing in the world.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.120]   But the signaling importance of law
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.000]   is that law sets the standard that we should look to.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.720]   And so suicide should be illegal.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.520]   It should be an illegal act
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.640]   so that people have one more reason out of many
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.200]   to not try to commit suicide,
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.480]   because that destroys a society.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.040]   And I'm not a legal theorist,
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.680]   but that's where I would like to discuss
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.920]   with regard to saying,
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.520]   well, aren't women going to harm themselves
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.480]   with a back alley abortion?
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.640]   I don't know.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.200]   I would guess so.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:12.040]   After all, people do horrific things all the time,
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.720]   no matter what the law is.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.280]   And if somebody wants to kill another person,
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.440]   they're gonna find someone to kill someone else.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.320]   What I don't think we have an obligation to do
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:27.160]   is to facilitate murder in a safe,
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.480]   comfortable environment.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.640]   After all, it's never safe or comfortable for the baby.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.400]   The baby is the one who always winds up dead.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.440]   And since babies can't defend themselves,
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.480]   you and I, who can defend morally innocent persons,
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.760]   you and I have to be the ones
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.600]   that stand up and defend the baby.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.960]   Now, there are many practical outworkings
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.000]   that we simply don't know.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.040]   We don't know all of the impact of things.
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.360]   We don't know how to do things.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.160]   And the other question you said was,
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.480]   is there a point of compromise,
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.880]   or will we always be arguing about it?
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.240]   I don't know.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:05.600]   What I do know is that the current system we have is immoral.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.840]   What I do know is that, just as a simple example,
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:14.040]   if there were anybody in my life who came to me
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.320]   and said, "I'm going to abort my baby,
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:23.800]   "but if I don't, would you do something else?"
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:27.560]   I would adopt any baby from,
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.480]   I can't say anyone in the world 'cause I'd be careful,
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:33.080]   'cause I would adopt any baby that I had contact with
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.880]   in order to save his life from being aborted.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:39.880]   And so right now, there are so many societal problems
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:42.240]   that we have with the adoption system,
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.760]   with all kinds of issues that are not being,
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.360]   they're not being attended to
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:51.000]   because we have a completely dysfunctional system.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.600]   And there are many solutions
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:57.600]   that we haven't created even yet that we could create.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.560]   And just putting it simply, right?
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.200]   So I've said this to multiple people.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.760]   I've said this to people that I have known.
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.920]   I've said, "Listen, if you ever found yourself pregnant
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.440]   "and you weren't going to keep the baby,
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.560]   "I just want you to know that I'll adopt the baby
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.320]   "because I feel like it's my moral duty to do that.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.480]   "If I'm gonna be against abortion
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:18.200]   "and I'm not gonna be willing to adopt children,
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.160]   "then I have a problem.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.880]   "I need to be super careful about that."
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.680]   That doesn't mean that it's always,
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.920]   that I always have to do it.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.120]   It doesn't mean, you know,
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.520]   we need to be careful with what we create.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.200]   But in general, there are all kinds of other systems
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.040]   that are not created, that are not done.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.160]   My wife and I, we went a number of years ago
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.080]   and explored adoption.
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.920]   And I still am interested in adopting children.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.000]   And we went and we visited.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.600]   I walked away from that experience,
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.160]   visiting with the government agencies.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:50.040]   I walked away from that experience saying basically,
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.160]   "There's no possible way
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.120]   "that I'll ever be able to adopt a baby."
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.960]   And the hardship of that,
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.280]   there aren't enough babies that are even available.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:02.280]   And then the cost and the hardship and everything of that,
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.680]   it's just that it's a really difficult scenario.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.240]   And so I can't go into it.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.960]   But my point is that we need to start from first principles
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.160]   and ask ourselves these deep philosophical questions
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.640]   that you and I began with.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:19.120]   Then continue that on and then try to find solutions
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.280]   that don't involve moral wrong.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.080]   And that's not always gonna be easy.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.400]   We shouldn't pretend it is.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.240]   We're adults.
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.080]   We have to deal with things that are hard.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:30.200]   But we need to be careful that we keep what is right
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.800]   and what is wrong in clear focus.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:38.680]   Or there's no limit to where we can go.
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.080]   And this would be my kind of comment of this monologue.
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.720]   And then I wanna hear your response.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.000]   But I had an experience in 2005 that shook me to my core.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.560]   I was in Guatemala in 2005,
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.040]   and I was up on top of a pyramid,
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:23:00.560]   a temple that was there.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.640]   And this is one of the temples with the local,
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.480]   I don't know if they were Mayans.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.720]   I forget the tribe now.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:09.160]   But it was a temple that was used for human sacrifice.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.480]   And I sat there on that temple,
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.880]   and I pictured the thousands and thousands
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.080]   and thousands of babies that were sacrificed
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.760]   right there on that pyramid.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.000]   And I don't know if I wept or not,
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.520]   but I wanna weep when I think about it,
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.240]   just because it really opened my eyes.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.040]   And if you look throughout history,
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.720]   you and I in the modern world, in our modern civilization,
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:41.120]   we are living in a world that is formed
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:46.120]   by men with moral courage who spread a message
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.880]   of moral virtue.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:53.040]   That has never been easy.
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:56.880]   And it is not the common experience of mankind.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:00.120]   The argument that we're having, or the discussion,
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.700]   I use argument in a philosophical sense.
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:05.800]   The argument that we're having at this time
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:10.400]   is something that we could only have in today's world,
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.760]   where you and I are trying to think through these issues
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.640]   as seriously as we can and reason with one another
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:19.600]   and reason with our neighbors in public and make arguments.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.600]   You and I are not resorting to force.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.760]   You and I are not picking up guns and shooting each other.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:28.080]   And that is vanishingly rare throughout human history.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:32.080]   Normally in human history, you just might makes right.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.360]   And it's the same with every expression of warfare.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.440]   It's the same with anything.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.680]   And you and I are not fundamentally different
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:43.320]   than those Mayans who sacrificed their babies
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:46.040]   to their god in cold blood.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.240]   There's no real difference between you and I,
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.880]   except that we have been raised in a society
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.160]   that cares about moral virtue.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.520]   So we need to be super careful
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.840]   that we don't ever stray away from that,
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.400]   but rather that we continue to proceed
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.560]   on this societal direction.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.860]   And we'll have to develop new systems,
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:06.440]   new institutions that cause,
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.080]   but I don't want to get away from the fact
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:13.080]   that most of the time the root cause of abortion
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.120]   is sin.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.400]   It's people knowing they're doing wrong
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.400]   and wanting to do it anyway.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.440]   I've spoken with a lot of women who do, excuse me,
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:26.240]   I've listened to a lot of women who do abortion ministry,
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:29.080]   and I've spoken to a handful of them.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:33.480]   And if you will go and talk to anti-abortion activist women
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.000]   who reach out to young women who are aborting their babies,
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.200]   you will find that the things
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.960]   that you and I are talking about now,
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.400]   the discussions of rape, incest in life of the mother,
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.960]   the discussion of, well, how will a woman,
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.920]   will a woman be damaged if she does a back alley abortion
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.560]   and she harmed, et cetera?
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.800]   This is not the vast majority of cases.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:55.840]   The vast majority of mothers who are murdering their babies
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.160]   are doing it because the baby is an inconvenience
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:01.320]   to their life and the baby can't defend himself.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.960]   And they know what they're doing is wrong
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.160]   and they're taking joy in it.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.060]   And I know that it sounds harsh for me to say that,
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.300]   but I've listened to enough of them
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:11.280]   who are actively talking to women in that situation,
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.840]   and I've seen enough of it come out in the public
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:17.480]   that I think that my statement is not incorrect.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:18.760]   So I didn't answer the, you know,
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:21.600]   is there gonna always be, let me,
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.080]   is there gonna be a point of compromise?
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.500]   I don't think there's gonna be a point of compromise ever.
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.360]   Well, I think what you're going to see ultimately
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.920]   is I think that in the fullness of time,
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.280]   abortion will be illegal in many places,
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.200]   not all places, but probably many places.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.620]   And if nothing else, the reason for that
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:41.660]   is that people who are pro-abortion kill their babies.
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:43.700]   And one of the reasons that,
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:46.260]   one of the challenges that men like you face,
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.980]   who are not particularly religious,
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:51.020]   is that religious people don't tend to,
[01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:52.460]   don't tend to be around, sorry,
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:56.340]   non-religious people don't tend to be around for very long.
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:58.140]   And so I think the future of the world
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:01.540]   is almost certainly more religious than it is today.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:03.580]   If we go back and we look at the,
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.180]   if we look at the statistics related to atheism
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:09.220]   from say the 1980s as compared to today,
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.860]   we see that non-belief in God,
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:15.460]   non-religious belief has dramatically declined.
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:18.320]   And we see that the future is basically being built
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.020]   by people who are religious.
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.980]   And if you look at the religious fault lines,
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:25.320]   even in our, if you look at the lines in our world today,
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.900]   if you look at our society,
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:30.060]   the people who are productive and who have babies
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.340]   are generally religious.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:35.980]   And the people who don't have babies are generally not.
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:38.060]   And the people who kill their babies,
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.340]   there's lots of people who with crosses
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:41.420]   on their back of their car
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:42.940]   that kill their babies, unfortunately.
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:45.860]   But in general, the people who kill their babies
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.100]   are generally non-religious.
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:49.860]   The people who welcome their babies are generally religious.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:51.460]   If you look at the sexual practices
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:53.780]   of the religious versus the non-religious,
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:55.580]   non-religious sexual practices
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.540]   generally don't result in babies.
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:59.500]   Or if they do result in babies,
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.980]   they generally cost 30 or $40,000
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:03.720]   to pay someone to birth a baby for them,
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.980]   which has its own slave market that we have to deal with.
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:09.660]   People who are religious generally have babies
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.260]   pretty easily and naturally.
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:13.100]   And so if for no other reason,
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:16.300]   birth rates are on the side of the religious people.
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:17.740]   And generally speaking,
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:19.580]   many of the major religions of the world
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.060]   are pretty united in their prohibition of abortion.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:23.920]   And so if for no other reason,
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:25.620]   I don't think there's gonna be a compromise.
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:28.820]   I think there's gonna be a very difficult time right now
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:32.220]   in the United States as we see of political effects
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.480]   and legal cases and things like that.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:37.880]   But in the fullness of time, generally speaking,
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.340]   it seems obvious to me that babies
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:45.820]   are worthy of our defense.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:48.700]   It's also obvious that we're going to be pretty desperate
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:50.020]   for babies in the future
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:53.520]   as we continue to live through population collapse.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.680]   And generally, religious people tend to outproduce
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.020]   and out procreate non-religious people.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:03.540]   And so it may just be a function of demographics
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:05.860]   and not a function of moral argumentation.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:07.220]   I'm hoping it comes faster.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:09.700]   But for that reason, I don't expect a compromise.
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:10.620]   In the fullness of time,
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.420]   I expect that eventually abortion
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:15.620]   will be hopefully abolished throughout the world,
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:17.820]   but it'll probably be a while before that happens.
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:18.640]   I spoke for a while.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.060]   So please share anything that you wanna say.
[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:22.480]   I didn't mean to go quite that long.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.500]   - That's fine.
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.820]   I don't know that I could speak for as long.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:28.420]   You got a lot more experience on the mic than I do.
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:33.060]   I think I agreed with almost everything you said
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:34.340]   with a couple of caveats.
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.820]   So yes, I also don't wanna live under some law of Hammurabi
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.020]   where you murder my brother
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.920]   and therefore I murder your mother and we're square.
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:42.860]   That's obviously wrong.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:44.740]   I don't wanna live in a society where murder
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.080]   is just openly accepted and it's okay to do
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.500]   and everyone turns a blind eye.
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.440]   That's also obviously wrong.
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:54.580]   I think from a values perspective, just strict values,
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:57.140]   you and I are probably pretty closely aligned.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:59.220]   I too am a father, I love my babies
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:04.220]   and I certainly appreciate everything that they offer to me.
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:06.940]   And if someone told me that at 39 weeks,
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:09.420]   they were going to try to abort them,
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:11.780]   yeah, I would fight them tooth and nail.
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:16.780]   My issue comes up in where we start defining personhood.
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:19.620]   I know you had said that personhood begins at conception
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.980]   and I've had trouble with that.
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:23.540]   So a little more background.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:25.300]   I was formerly a Christian for a long time,
[01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:29.660]   but I started having, I guess, holes kind of poked in that
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.980]   around questions where it was just
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:34.380]   kind of a doctrinal faith answer.
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:38.020]   And I guess my general synopsis is that
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:40.860]   it's hard for me to accept answers like that
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:43.820]   when it seems that time and time again,
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:46.900]   the modern apologetics from Christians
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:51.860]   tend to try to assimilate scientific findings
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:54.980]   instead of just looking back
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:59.340]   at the way the doctrine has been ascribed for decades
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.660]   and saying, okay, well, this was clearly wrong
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:02.620]   and we're going to update.
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:05.380]   No, it's okay, we'll find a new scriptural verse
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:07.420]   that is permissive of these things
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:09.260]   that we now know to be scientifically true
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:10.940]   without a question of a doubt.
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:13.380]   So all of that to say,
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:15.260]   I guess the main difference comes up
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:17.220]   when we start talking about personhood.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:20.860]   I can't say I think personhood begins at conception.
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.140]   In fact, I don't think I would.
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:27.020]   I also don't think it begins at birth.
[01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:31.300]   That seems to me to be kind of equally flawed in thinking
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:34.140]   and whatever side of the argument you're on,
[01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:36.820]   I think, at least from my worldview,
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:39.540]   both of those have some flaws to them.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:42.020]   What I think is that we're running into,
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:44.620]   or we will at some point run into a scenario
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.420]   where we know a lot more about
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:49.780]   what makes a human brain conscious.
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:51.220]   And at the end of the day,
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:56.220]   I think we care most about the humanity of an embryo
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.700]   or humanity of a fetus.
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:01.660]   I scientifically don't think there's much difference
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:06.220]   between a zygote or a blastocyst from a goat or a newt
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.020]   or a human or any other animal.
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:09.340]   If we look at it under a microscope,
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:11.860]   they're all gonna look very, very much the same.
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:16.740]   There's certainly a point when from an embryo perspective,
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.540]   there starts to be morphological changes.
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:21.300]   And again, I'll offer the same credentials you did.
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:25.380]   I'm not a doctor, I'm not a gestational scientist,
[01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:28.300]   just I know enough from reading to be a little dangerous.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:31.780]   We're gonna run into a point where we know a lot more
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:36.420]   about when the consciousness enters
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:38.860]   or develops in the brain from electrical signals
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:41.620]   and impulses and neurons firing than we know right now.
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:45.380]   And I guess my concern is that
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:47.860]   that will kind of slide through the news cycle
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:50.660]   as unimportant because everyone has already decided
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:54.340]   when human consciousness begins for them.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:57.580]   And to me, human consciousness is really the thing
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:00.380]   that we care about here that separates us.
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:04.580]   I don't see any evidence for a soul being breathed
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.900]   into a zygote.
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.900]   It's very difficult for me just to accept that
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:10.740]   as a matter of faith
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:12.900]   because it's not something that I possess.
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:16.140]   So I guess the reason I asked about the,
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:18.140]   are we ever going to reach a period
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.980]   where we can come to some agreement,
[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:23.380]   it's under the hope that at some point,
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:25.620]   we'll know more than we do right now to be able to say,
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:29.420]   okay, definitively, 12 weeks, 20 weeks, whatever it is,
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:33.220]   this is when this thing can feel pain,
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.740]   experience human consciousness.
[01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:38.260]   And that's really what we care about.
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:43.500]   So it's difficult for me to accept just the basis
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:48.460]   that personhood, to use the term you used,
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.780]   begins at conception.
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:54.700]   And I think the challenge we run into in our society
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:59.700]   is that a lot of the most vocal proponents
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:04.780]   on the anti-abortion side tend to use the notion
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:08.060]   that there can be no exceptions to this.
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:11.380]   You frequently hear it from, I guess,
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.660]   my side of the argument.
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:15.500]   Well, if you don't want to have an abortion,
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.380]   then don't have an abortion.
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:18.220]   I get that.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:20.420]   And I would support that.
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:23.340]   And mind you, I'm not pro-abortion.
[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:26.500]   I think I feel similarly to you
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.660]   that if someone I knew were preparing to have an abortion,
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:33.180]   I would really strongly consider having them deliver the baby
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:36.380]   if they were later term and raising the baby myself.
[01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:38.460]   'Cause I think that's a strong value to have
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:39.420]   if you can do it.
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:46.180]   I guess I'm, as usual with these conversations,
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.620]   it comes down to a matter of,
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:50.220]   do you believe that souls exist or that souls don't exist?
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:54.380]   And if a soul is breathed into a human at conception,
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:57.660]   then your side of the argument makes perfect rational sense.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:01.780]   From my side of the argument, without that belief,
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:04.460]   the rationality is kind of lost
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:09.460]   to just not knowing exactly where that point lands.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:12.420]   It's not, to me, it's not at the beginning.
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:13.260]   It's not at the end.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:15.140]   We just don't know enough yet.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:18.700]   So I guess that'll be my response.
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:22.060]   - I think your critique of Christians
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:25.420]   or various religious people wanting to update
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:30.020]   their theories as scientific evidence emerges
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.940]   and say, look, we got it right, is a very valid one.
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:37.100]   And so I wanna affirm you in that critique.
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.340]   I don't know that it's always,
[01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:43.580]   I don't know that the critique is always applicable,
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:47.140]   but it certainly can be something that people do.
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.620]   And the world is flat.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:50.060]   Well, look, the Bible says the world is fat.
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:50.900]   Well, the world is round.
[01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:52.540]   Look, the Bible says the world is round.
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:56.540]   And you see various people do that from various religions.
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:59.500]   And so I think that that's a fair critique.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:02.700]   And it can be something that people would do.
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.900]   And it may also be true that we don't have answers.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:09.020]   I would, you and I would be fully shared
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:10.980]   in that we don't necessarily have answers.
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.420]   So at the end of the day, we're gonna be saying,
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:15.300]   this seems best to me.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.140]   I don't see another place to put this.
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:20.400]   And so I would say, as an example,
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:25.580]   can I acknowledge that it's difficult
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:28.980]   to accept an 82-celled organism
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:32.700]   that I can't see as a person?
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.780]   Certainly, I would acknowledge that.
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:38.940]   It's much easier for me to see a 41-week baby as a person
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:43.940]   than a 41-hour fertilized, whatever it's called
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:46.940]   at that stage of gestation, as a person.
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:51.940]   Certainly, I would acknowledge that openly,
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:55.620]   that in terms of human intuition,
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:59.140]   one is much easier to relate to than the other.
[01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:01.740]   I just, I don't see where else you would put it.
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:03.300]   And I think you see that working out
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:04.980]   in our debate on this subject,
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:06.820]   in our discussion on this subject,
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:09.380]   that if you went back 20 years,
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:12.740]   and what was Bill Clinton's quote, President Clinton?
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:14.940]   Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:16.580]   And you look at the argument today.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:18.340]   I mean, that was something that I think
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:23.180]   really a lot of people were united on at that time,
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:25.420]   that you would have had guys like you and me
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:27.180]   that would have said, well, we have different,
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:29.060]   I don't think so, but okay, I understand.
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:31.220]   And that legal thing is-- - Close enough.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:35.180]   - Close enough, maybe we could share this to some degree.
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:37.060]   But what we see, for whatever reason,
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:40.700]   is that that is not where we are right now.
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:44.740]   You see the strong form of,
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:48.460]   so the pro-life camp is not a united camp,
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:49.700]   it's pretty squishy.
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:53.780]   And so right now, you see a strong moral movement
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:55.780]   in the anti-abortion crowd,
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:58.380]   coming from the abolitionists,
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.460]   those who wanna abolish human abortion.
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:05.060]   That abolitionist movement is gaining ground
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:06.620]   on the pro-life camp.
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:08.580]   And then you see, in the pro-abortion camp,
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:13.580]   you see a widespread saying of,
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:20.460]   listen, we will not tolerate any restrictions whatsoever.
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:23.180]   I often wonder if this is just an expression
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:27.220]   of the US-American political system
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:28.980]   that creates this environment for us.
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:30.420]   Because if you go around the world,
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:34.740]   it seems to me that most, other than perhaps Canada,
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:36.780]   I don't know of a country in the world
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:41.780]   that has more rights to abortion than the United States.
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:44.900]   I would say Canada certainly has more,
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:46.420]   but there's probably one or two others.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:49.300]   But abortion is very highly restricted
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:52.500]   in much of the world, especially in the European world,
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.700]   where we have a common heritage
[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:55.580]   as compared to the US system.
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:58.380]   And I don't know, I guess is my point.
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:59.220]   I don't know.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:00.540]   I do have one question, though.
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:03.260]   Is there a reason, since we've discovered DNA,
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:05.980]   and since we can measure DNA,
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:09.780]   would you be willing to accept the baby's separate DNA
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:12.300]   as a sufficient evidence of personhood,
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.780]   of a unique identity?
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:18.460]   - I'm not sure.
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:23.460]   My initial kind of gut-check response is yes.
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:26.400]   But I haven't considered that.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.940]   I'll have to take that back with me
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:29.720]   and mull over it a little bit.
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:34.620]   - I think if there is a scientific solution,
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:36.780]   I think it would be that one,
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:39.560]   at least in terms of our current scientific knowledge.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:44.460]   That one and then just the general intuition of rights.
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:49.460]   As I see it, maybe it's Peter Singer.
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:51.820]   And I would say that one of the things that's interesting
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:54.420]   is I think there are a variety of things that are related.
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:56.020]   If you go and read Singer's writings,
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:40:01.020]   one of his most important contributions in his sphere
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:04.060]   was his writings on speciesism
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:06.680]   and the preferential treatment that humans receive
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.220]   as compared to animals.
[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:11.080]   And so you interact in today's world
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.020]   with many ethical vegans, ethical vegetarians,
[01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:15.100]   as they style themselves,
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:18.860]   that basically don't distinguish between human persons
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:22.540]   and animals in terms of rights.
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:25.320]   And so you see people trying to defend animals
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.540]   and get animals into courts
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:30.260]   and give animals the same rights that human beings have.
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.620]   And I think that's kind of the logical outflow as well.
[01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:34.900]   I see these three issues as related.
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:39.260]   Number one, abortion is related to,
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:40.900]   number two, euthanasia,
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:43.100]   is kind of the second expression of it
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:46.000]   because many of the arguments around abortion
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.380]   have a natural fellow argument in the face of euthanasia.
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:53.940]   And as you see euthanasia spreading around the world,
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:56.240]   then I think those are naturally related
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:59.060]   in terms of the same arguments that I would use
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:01.780]   to defend the rights of a baby
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:05.220]   are the same arguments I would use to oppose euthanasia.
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:08.180]   And then the same arguments of autonomy
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:11.900]   that someone would use to promote the right of a woman
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:14.040]   to abort her baby would be the same arguments
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:19.040]   that would be commonly used to defend access to euthanasia.
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:24.180]   And then the third would be simply arguments
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:28.400]   related to animals and our rights over animals
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:30.480]   or our defense of animals
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:32.560]   and everything associated with speciesism,
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.400]   the most obvious expression of that being
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:38.720]   in the ethical, vegetarian, vegan world.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:40.240]   And so I think they're related.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.040]   And I think that maybe there will be,
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.760]   I don't think that science is ever gonna create
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.740]   some system of rights.
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:50.760]   So far, if it is so far,
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:52.760]   it seems like an abject failure to me.
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.200]   So I think we're always gonna be left
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:59.200]   with a fundamentally religious understanding of the world
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:04.400]   in some form that will be informed by science.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.480]   And I don't have a problem
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.040]   with those two things functioning side by side.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:13.360]   I think that, I'm of course partial
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.160]   to toot our own horns as Christians,
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:19.500]   but I think Christians were hugely responsible,
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.380]   maybe not entirely,
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:23.420]   but hugely responsible for the scientific revolution.
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:25.180]   I think it's a net gain.
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:28.540]   But it seems to me that scientists desperately need
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:31.220]   some really strong moral supervision
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:32.680]   on behalf of religious leaders,
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:36.340]   'cause without that, we wind up in a hellish landscape.
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:37.900]   So I wanna thank you for the conversation
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:39.260]   because I'm gonna go back through
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.980]   and think these things over myself.
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:42.680]   I've given you my best defense.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:44.980]   And I think that on the whole,
[01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:49.980]   what is, we should be involved in our,
[01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:53.100]   we should be involved philosophically kind of debating this.
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:55.740]   If we have to vote, then that's where this comes in
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:57.220]   and defending different things.
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:59.940]   But on the whole, I can walk side by side with you
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:03.180]   and say that if we see babies that are unwanted,
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:05.460]   let's bring those babies in and care for them.
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:06.980]   And let's provide care for mothers
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.580]   who can't care for their babies.
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:09.680]   Let's support them.
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:11.900]   And I think that most people
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:13.780]   are not even gonna be able to follow the discussion
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:14.780]   that we've had.
[01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:17.660]   But they certainly will see the effect of our actions.
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:20.060]   And so I wanna have this discussion.
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:21.140]   That's why we had it.
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:23.660]   But we should also just continue to focus on the actions.
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:25.620]   And then regardless of differing beliefs,
[01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:28.140]   there's a broad array of actions that we can be united on.
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:29.340]   And we can defend our neighbor
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:31.700]   and love our neighbor as much as possible.
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:35.780]   - Well said, I'll be calling back in
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:37.860]   to muse on the subject more with you.
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.100]   Really appreciate the time.
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:41.340]   - I hope that you will and I look forward to it.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.620]   - And with that, we go to Kyle.
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:45.180]   Kyle, thank you for your patience.
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:46.580]   Welcome, Kyle from Washington.
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:47.880]   How can I serve you today?
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.580]   - Hi, thank you.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:54.380]   I have a question earlier in the year.
[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:57.460]   You mentioned something about seeing accounting
[01:43:57.460 --> 01:44:00.500]   and bookkeeping going away or changing meaningfully
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:05.260]   in the next few years as a result of AI's influence
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:06.180]   on the profession.
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:09.620]   And I'm curious if you could please elaborate
[01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:13.580]   on what you see, why you see it changing,
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:17.860]   and do you think it's gonna entirely replace
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:19.340]   the human element of the profession?
[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:20.720]   What do you see going on?
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:25.540]   - Fair question, and the caveat I would always say
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:27.060]   is I'm not an accountant, I'm not a bookkeeper.
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:29.020]   If I have an accountant or bookkeeper in the audience
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:32.020]   who knows accounting more intimately than I do
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:35.180]   and has opinions, I would welcome that person
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:37.020]   to reach out to me and us to have
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:38.780]   an in-depth discussion on it.
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:40.460]   But since this is my Q&A show and I don't have
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:41.760]   that person waiting on the other line,
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.260]   I will tell you why I said that.
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:48.580]   First, it's been my observation that the general trend
[01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:53.380]   in accounting has been, for a long time,
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:55.460]   an offshoring trend.
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:58.540]   And when I first started working with an accountant,
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:02.260]   I had an actual accountant who actually worked with me
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:04.460]   and he was an experienced guy
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.740]   and he would do my stuff for me.
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:09.460]   Then I switched to a different accountant
[01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:11.220]   and this accountant had a team of accountants
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:15.220]   in another country who would do all of the entry work
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:18.920]   and the basic stuff, and then he would just look
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.980]   at the returns and sign off on them.
[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:25.140]   And then I changed and I've used software programs
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:27.300]   and I find that I think the software programs
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:29.660]   can do a great job for most people.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:31.940]   And so if you look at the basic functions
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:36.100]   of bookkeeping and accounting,
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:39.500]   a lot of them are functions that, today,
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:42.380]   can be done by software and many of them are functions
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:44.700]   that can be done anywhere in the world.
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:49.300]   And those kinds of features are the features
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:51.780]   that I'm looking for to see an industry
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:53.500]   that's gonna be disrupted
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:57.240]   by increasingly powerful artificial intelligence.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:59.700]   So if we follow a transaction through,
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:01.580]   let's say that I have a transaction
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:03.300]   where I purchase something for my business.
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.220]   Let's assume that I use a business credit card
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:07.300]   that only has business expenses.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:09.460]   First, there's a significant amount of information
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:11.180]   that's related to that transaction
[01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:14.180]   that'll be on my transaction report from the bank.
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:16.580]   And even if my statement doesn't currently reflect it,
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:19.060]   there's even more information that could be gathered there
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:23.140]   from the merchant as the merchant ID and the category
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:24.900]   and all that directly from the merchant.
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:28.500]   Then I have an invoice or a receipt.
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:30.780]   Well, today, I can take that invoice or receipt,
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:33.000]   I can take a picture of it, run it through a scanner,
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.080]   a computer can run an optical character recognition program
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.580]   on it, and it can gather all of the information
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:40.000]   from that receipt.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.120]   If I now upload that receipt just to chat GPT,
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:46.560]   which is not in any way designed for accounting,
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:49.000]   but if I upload the picture of the receipt,
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:54.000]   chat GPT will pull out a huge amount of relevant information
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.440]   from the transaction of all of the details from it.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:00.400]   And I can tell, I can take, I've been testing this,
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:01.640]   I can take a receipt.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.840]   Generally, it doesn't work so well
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.800]   with a super minimized receipt,
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:07.640]   but let's say I had an itemized receipt.
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:11.080]   I can take this as a picture, I can upload it to chat GPT,
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:13.880]   and I can tell chat GPT, which I repeat,
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:17.960]   is not designed for this, it's just a general GPT model.
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:21.680]   And I can say, give me all of the categories,
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:24.760]   pull out for me all of the meat from this receipt
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:27.480]   and tell me how much money I spent on meat.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.240]   Or I can say, give me all the categories,
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:31.480]   categorize all my information on this thing,
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:35.080]   and tell me what I spent in each category.
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:37.760]   So you can already today use chat GPT
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:39.080]   to make your bookkeeping easier
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:39.920]   if you're trying to figure out
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.040]   how much you spend on meat versus vegetables.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:44.440]   It's pretty simple and straightforward.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.600]   Now, take the next thing.
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:48.040]   What's all the income data?
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:49.960]   Well, all the income data is easily done.
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:53.360]   I can take a W-2, I can take a 1099,
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.440]   and all of the data and the information that I need
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.680]   is right there, the computer can model it.
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:59.680]   And so, and plus I have bank statements,
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:02.680]   so I don't see any technological barrier
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:06.120]   as to why all of this information cannot be applied
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:12.280]   by an artificial intelligence program
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:14.080]   to integrate this information.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.200]   Now, the next thing is I've been playing a lot
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:19.200]   with chat GPT with regard to financial planning.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:22.680]   And I find that it's pretty good with financial planning.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.280]   It's not perfect, but it's pretty good.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.840]   So it's got access to huge amounts of data,
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:29.520]   it can contextualize, it can do really good stuff
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:31.120]   with financial data.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:34.800]   Tax stuff is generally much simpler than financial planning
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.760]   because tax stuff is all backwards looking.
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:39.720]   Financial planning involves significant amounts
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:41.600]   of projection and assumptions.
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:44.360]   Tax stuff doesn't involve much of that at all.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.240]   So this is the low-hanging fruit
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:49.080]   for some kind of AI model to work with
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.520]   because you have solid numbers, you've got transactions,
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:56.000]   and you've got just basically synthesizing that information
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000]   and putting it into a tax form.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000]   And then, and I see no reason why,
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.520]   and I shouldn't expect that to be the standard
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.640]   going forward for tax data.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.760]   So what it actually looks like, where the data comes from,
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:13.160]   I don't know, but anything that can be done
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.800]   by a computer program and anything that can be done
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:19.520]   with offshoring, with sending data around virtually,
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.360]   that seems like the first kinds of jobs
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:25.640]   that will succumb to artificial intelligence.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.160]   Anything that can't be done by a computer program,
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:29.760]   so some kind of soft skill,
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.680]   some kind of interpersonal relational skill,
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:34.680]   or something that can't be outsourced
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:36.440]   or can't be sent around the world,
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.640]   I think we still have good moats against that.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:41.960]   But that's my argument in favor of the statement that I said.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:44.720]   - Gotcha.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.400]   And then this might be a let me Google that
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:49.440]   for you type of question,
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:54.440]   but what type of learning resources do you recommend
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:58.840]   for somebody that's interested in digging into
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:01.960]   learning about how to utilize AI?
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:05.360]   - I think the best one to start with is just starting.
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:08.880]   What I mean is there's stuff out there, I'm sure,
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:12.280]   probably 80% of it written by AI.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:13.960]   I would say the first thing you should do
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.640]   is if you don't have one,
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:18.360]   establish a subscription with ChatGPT
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.400]   so you have access to Chat 4.0,
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:24.280]   and just start playing with it, start using it.
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.080]   And make it kind of a hobby of yours to put stuff into it.
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.680]   And there are many other models.
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:33.440]   I am in no way an expert on AI.
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:34.960]   There are many other things available,
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.200]   but I think that there are so many things
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:38.640]   that you'll see in your own life
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.980]   that it's a really valuable,
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:44.000]   it's a really valuable personal assistant for most people.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.960]   And you can use it in many areas of your life.
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:49.600]   We don't have any clue even what the starting point
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:53.200]   of all the areas that you can use it is.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:54.520]   But it's there.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:57.640]   So take, if you are involved in accounting
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:59.360]   or bookkeeping in some way,
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:02.000]   take some of your receipts or take some of your invoices
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.480]   and load them up into it.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.140]   From a personal finance perspective,
[01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:06.560]   take your monthly budget,
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:08.400]   upload your monthly budget into it and say,
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:10.160]   "Hey, chat, I'm trying to figure out
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.200]   "where I can cut some costs."
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.060]   Go back and forth with it, talk to it back and forth.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:19.080]   And I don't, there's huge amounts of it that are not useful,
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:23.800]   but the difference between 1.0 and two and three and four now
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.480]   and then five, I don't know when five's coming,
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:27.280]   but the difference is enormous.
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.880]   And so there's plenty of utility
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:31.000]   that you can get an idea of where we're going.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.920]   And it's a powerful, powerful tool,
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.320]   but I wouldn't suggest anything
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.160]   except just starting to play with it.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:39.080]   - Okay.
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:40.320]   - Okay.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:41.360]   Yeah, there's probably people,
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:43.360]   the most valuable training tools would be
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:45.360]   if someone would show you their prompts.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:47.800]   There are, I see people advertising,
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:50.040]   prompting classes and things.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:52.080]   There probably will be more and more of that,
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:57.080]   but getting good output from an AI model
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:59.920]   is very much a function of your skill
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:04.000]   with creating the prompts that are useful to you.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000]   And so that's where the skill development is.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.280]   And, but you can learn a lot of that organically.
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:11.500]   There's a learning curve where you learn it yourself,
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:13.720]   then you start to hear what other people's prompts are.
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:16.020]   Sometimes I'll show people my prompts and they're like,
[01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.560]   "Wow, I never knew you could do that."
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:19.000]   And so you'll have a similar experience
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.640]   as you play with it and talk to your friends
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.680]   who are also playing with it.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:26.200]   - Would Gabriel tell me that I need a whole nother computer?
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:27.040]   Or is it...
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:32.720]   - I haven't asked him about his opinions on AI.
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:37.720]   I think that I would say the good thing about it is that,
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:39.800]   so you should expect that there is going to be
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.000]   a privacy leak there,
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.440]   because any information you put out is there.
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:47.000]   I would say that you can probably have a decent level
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.280]   of interaction with it if you use a clean computer.
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:53.860]   And then the good thing is that signing up for it,
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:54.700]   signing up for chat,
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:59.040]   all you need is a pretty basic email address
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:00.520]   and a way to pay digitally.
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:02.300]   So whether that's a privacy.com debit card
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:04.640]   or whether it's prepaid, other debit card,
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.640]   they don't accept Bitcoin or Monero,
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:08.760]   anything that I know of.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:10.520]   So you just need some kind of digital card
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:11.400]   and that'll be good.
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:14.260]   Just be cautious of what you're putting out into it,
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:16.160]   because every piece of information
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:18.200]   is always going to be stored in some way.
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:21.640]   - All right.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:23.040]   - All right, Kyle, thank you for the question.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.120]   Really appreciate it.
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:26.120]   And I want to thank you to all of those
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.240]   who have listened to the show.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:30.280]   I know I certainly did take quite a long time there
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:34.880]   with that discussion on abortion, but it is important.
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:38.000]   And as always, you have a fast forward button,
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.040]   you have a skip button,
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.280]   use those things whenever you want.
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:43.360]   But it is important that we have those discussions
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.680]   and we need to have them even various formats.
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:49.160]   So thank you for calling in and making me think.
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:51.440]   And I welcome if you'd like to call in
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:53.620]   and talk about another hard question,
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:55.680]   we should do this regularly.
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:59.900]   I want to live in a society in which mature men and women
[01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:03.640]   can sit down and can discuss difficult topics together.
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:06.800]   We can come as friends and we can leave as friends.
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.620]   And I don't see any reason that should not be our standard.
[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.120]   And of course, we live in a society
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:13.800]   filled with acrimony and argumentation.
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:15.480]   And there's probably a place for that.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:16.520]   There's a place for polemics.
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:17.960]   There's a place for all that stuff.
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:19.680]   But I want to live in a society
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:22.520]   in which serious minded men and women can sit down
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:25.960]   and talk about important, difficult decisions,
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:27.600]   factor in new information,
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:29.560]   and then share those things with other people.
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:32.880]   Because I believe in the value of that interaction
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:35.080]   producing synergistic results.
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.880]   One plus one is more than two
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:39.540]   when people are interacting appropriately.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:40.380]   Thank you for listening.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:41.400]   Remember, if you'd like to join me next week,
