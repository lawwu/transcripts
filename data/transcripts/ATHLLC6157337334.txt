[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.560]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.760]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.320]   I cannot believe I'm saying this,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.760]   but welcome to episode 100.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.840]   It seems so surreal that I've come this far with the podcast
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.680]   but it really wouldn't be possible without your support.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.800]   So thank you so much for listening
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.680]   and supporting me on this journey.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.520]   Okay, as for this week's episode,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.480]   I wanted to try something a bit different.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.560]   And the idea came up as I was talking
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960]   to my good friend Brad Barrett,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.200]   who hosts the Choose Fi podcast,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.560]   and was also my guest for episode two
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.320]   on financial independence.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.960]   We started having a conversation
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.200]   about me making it to episode 100,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.520]   him taking his show over on his own
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.040]   and all the things we've learned the past few months
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.600]   and how we're applying them to our lives this year.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.120]   Things like focusing on what matters the most,
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.580]   optimizing our life towards net fulfillment,
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.100]   outsourcing tasks and a lot more.
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.120]   But instead of having that whole conversation,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360]   we paused and decided to record it
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.160]   and share it with you today.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.360]   It'll also be in the Choose Fi podcast feed next week.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.520]   So while you might not need to listen to it twice,
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.740]   you should definitely check out his show.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.000]   It is so fantastic and it touches on every aspect
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700]   of financial independence.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.200]   Okay, enough of the intro.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.760]   Let's get into the episode right after this.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.960]   Brad, I am so excited we're doing this.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.680]   - Yeah, Chris, this should be fun.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.560]   We always have a lot of interesting conversations offline.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.400]   So this should be a fun meandering little chat here.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.280]   - And I don't know if you knew this.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.720]   So this is my episode 100, but I went back and looked
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.000]   and I know you weren't my episode one,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400]   but you're episode two on all the hacks.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   And we actually recorded that first.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.000]   So my very first hit record on a podcast was with you.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.720]   So I'm very excited and thankful for you doing that.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.900]   And it's fun to be celebrating 100 with you.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.840]   - Oh, that's so cool.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.920]   Well, I am honored that I was the first guest
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   and back for 100 here.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.760]   Yeah, it's wild.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.600]   I can't believe you've been doing it that long.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.640]   100 episodes.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.880]   - I love how Brad is saying this
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.240]   because if you haven't listened to "Choose If I", his show,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.400]   Brad's probably done 600 episodes at this point.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.640]   I feel like I'm way, way, way behind.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.360]   But when I started, I wasn't sure
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.640]   if it was gonna be 10 episodes
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.980]   and it just wasn't gonna be a good fit.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.240]   So the idea that I've gone from side project
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.440]   to full-time job on podcasting, I'm lucky to do that.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.140]   I'm so thankful for everyone listening
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.040]   that has enabled me to do that.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.240]   And I'm just excited for the next 100.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.560]   - Yeah, I hear you.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.960]   What's wild about podcasting
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.520]   is there's no downside essentially to trying it.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.320]   So yeah, we're coming up right on 600,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.880]   but when we started, it was just me and Jonathan
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.960]   sitting in a random spare office in Jonathan's house
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.160]   in Richmond, Virginia, talking into two microphones.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.400]   It cost us essentially nothing to start.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.720]   And we figured, what the hell?
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.760]   Let's experiment with this.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.040]   And if it goes nowhere, no harm, no foul in essence, right?
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.640]   Like nobody's ever gonna hear it other than our parents.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.720]   And if it goes somewhere,
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.880]   then who knows what kind of impact it could have.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.840]   It's pretty wild.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.440]   Certainly podcasting is something
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.360]   that I never would have guessed in a million years
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.480]   would transform my life.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.000]   I was a corporate accountant.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.040]   I did corporate state tax returns,
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.220]   which is as horrible and mind-numbing as you can imagine.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.240]   And now I'm a financial independence podcaster
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.320]   with 60 million downloads.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.160]   It's crazy.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.560]   And then to see your life transformed so dramatically
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.440]   since the first time I met you,
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.600]   which I guess was through
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.680]   the "Playing With Fire" documentary, right?
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.320]   - Yeah, I went to the FIRE,
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.360]   well, I guess it's not technically a FIRE conference,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.560]   but FinCon seems like it's pretty rooted
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.800]   in the financial independence movement for my startup.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.080]   'Cause I was like, "Oh, we're building software
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.040]   "for financial planners and people
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.220]   "who wanna be better with finances.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.440]   "I should go to this conference."
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   We met and it's been a great friendship.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.080]   And really kind of like how this episode came to be
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.620]   was we were just talking about things in life
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.120]   and catching up and we're like, "We should record this."
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.120]   Like people would probably wanna hear
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.200]   what we're thinking about, how last year went,
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.040]   what we're planning to do next year,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.800]   what's going on with the FIRE movement,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.300]   all the things, health and data breaches, everything.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.560]   So I'm excited to just jump in
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.640]   and go through what we go through.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.560]   And if this does well, people like it,
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.760]   obviously reach out to Brad and I, let us know,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.560]   and we can make it a regular thing.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.640]   - Yeah, I would love to do this a couple of times a year
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.480]   and that's for damn sure.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.240]   So yeah, let's kick it off.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.000]   The biggest thing in your world,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.240]   I don't wanna put words in your mouth,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.800]   but you're full-time now on this podcast
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.760]   and you left Wealthfront fairly recently, right?
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.520]   It's not an easy decision no matter where you are in life.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   I know obviously like you have a degree
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.000]   of financial security that a lot of people don't necessarily
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.160]   when they're making job transitions,
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.760]   but nevertheless, that's not an easy step.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.160]   And I'm curious, like how you thought through it.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.360]   - For me, I am always a fan of the side hustle
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.880]   to full-time hustle path.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.640]   I started the podcast as a thing on the side.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.600]   I kind of experimented with working with partners
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.640]   and then got it to a point where it was, I guess,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.320]   big enough, financially stable enough
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.040]   that it was worth the risk.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.120]   Is it financially stable enough
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.400]   that I would make as much money
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.920]   as if I had a corporate job right now?
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.760]   Probably not.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.360]   But do I see a path there and can I make it work?
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.200]   Yes.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.600]   And so that was really all I needed.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.520]   I still love Wealthfront, the product.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.720]   I still love the team.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.000]   In fact, the one thing that is sad
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.200]   about being a full-time creator is it's kind of lonely.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.440]   You don't have that kind of water cooler team experience
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.320]   that you do at a company.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.280]   And so I do miss that.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.840]   I still have a text thread
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   with all of the Wealthfront people that I was close with.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.720]   We're talking almost every day,
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.560]   but I felt like it was an opportunity
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.680]   that if a friend asked me if they should take on,
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.120]   I was like, "Yes, you should."
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.760]   So I needed to do it myself.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.200]   I needed to kind of take my own advice.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.560]   And you, you had a co-host for a long time
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.520]   and now you're kind of running the show.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.800]   Quite literally.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.760]   Quite literally running the show.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.960]   Yeah, it's hard to believe.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.640]   Yeah, so Jonathan,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.200]   I guess it was probably August of last year.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.920]   Yeah, we're coming five months and change.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.080]   He came to me and said,
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.000]   "I think I'm gonna step back from the podcast."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.560]   And it was definitely a surprise.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.240]   And to everybody out there who,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.680]   'cause I got a ton of emails.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.840]   I'm like, "Oh, what's going on?
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.000]   "Is everything okay?"
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.920]   Everything's great.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.640]   Jonathan and I are still great friends.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.520]   In fact, I just came from a workout with him at the gym.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.480]   We're working out together four days a week now
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.840]   and he's doing stuff behind the scenes for Choose a Vice.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.080]   So we're still business partners.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.920]   Everything's great.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.920]   He's gonna come back on the show every now and again.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.600]   But yeah, man, it's been interesting.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.960]   And you and I have talked a ton of times,
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.440]   talked shop actually, which is funny.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.600]   Like though I've been a podcaster,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.480]   I basically just have always showed up and recorded
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.320]   and that was it.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.880]   And Jonathan kind of took care of everything.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.200]   Yeah, when you're saying running the show,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.040]   it's been a big change for me, honestly.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.800]   And what I've always been good at in terms of the podcast
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.680]   was kind of like sitting back and just listening critically
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.280]   and asking questions.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.320]   And I mean, frankly, like for me and my skillset,
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.160]   that was pretty easy.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.120]   It wasn't a heavy lift.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.200]   I just listened and asked her a couple of questions
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.640]   here and there, hopefully incisive, interesting questions.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.440]   But damn, now I've got to do Jonathan's part and mine,
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.200]   which is Jonathan was always,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.320]   hey, he was the engine behind the show.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.640]   The reason why I'm going into this,
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.840]   I'm curious of like your process is,
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.440]   it is not just 2X the work for me.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.360]   Now, like being the engine behind the show,
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.120]   the story arc, and then the questions,
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.560]   there's some like exponential factor,
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.960]   especially with my brain.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.560]   Like when I get done with this, I'm fried, man.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.920]   I mean, normally like on a interview,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.080]   because you have to essentially bifurcate your brain of,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.680]   okay, this side has to think about the story arc
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.280]   and moving it forward and making interesting and logical
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.920]   and coming to a conclusion.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.200]   But then the other side has to think of questions
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.240]   that are interesting and, oh, what would I want to ask
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.440]   if I were the podcast listener?
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.240]   'Cause that's how I think of myself.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.200]   And man, it is exponentially more difficult,
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.760]   but so far, I think it's going pretty well.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.520]   It's been 20 plus episodes now and so far so good.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.360]   It's been a challenge.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.200]   I'm not gonna lie.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.680]   It's been a challenge, but it's been good.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.000]   - I think people that are listening think,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.320]   oh yeah, podcasting, it's so great.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.640]   You just hop on, have a conversation,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.160]   but there's a lot of work behind the scenes.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.560]   I spend a lot of time just trying to plan out
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.560]   what is the topics.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.160]   And somebody emailed me and said,
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.960]   hey, it'd be great if you could work
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.480]   with more sponsors I've never heard of.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.440]   And you could interview people
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.960]   that have never been on other shows.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.560]   And it's like, yes, but finding those people,
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.200]   finding those companies to work with,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.520]   it's definitely a full-time job.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.000]   I didn't want to start another startup
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.240]   'cause I didn't want to have another 80 hour a week job.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.960]   And my wife and I joke together.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.440]   It's like, oh, you did start a startup.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.600]   You just didn't call it a startup.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.360]   So it's definitely demanding, but it's great.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.800]   You get a lot of flexibility and people listening
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.360]   probably know that I've been experimenting a lot with,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.200]   okay, well, what if I just do some solo episodes?
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.000]   What if I talk about a country?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.800]   What if I do something different
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.480]   and don't necessarily stick to only the interview regime?
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.840]   I mean, this is an example of that.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.760]   It's kind of an interview,
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.120]   but it's really more of conversation.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.800]   So that's been fun.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.200]   And then I've been trying to make sure
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.560]   that it's not my only thing.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.160]   We could talk about podcasting forever,
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.320]   but the average person listening here is probably like,
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.400]   oh, I don't have a podcast.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.760]   I appreciate the background.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.400]   It's interesting, but we are able to use the topic
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.120]   of the people we talk to and the content we consume
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.640]   as kind of research for the show
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.160]   as ways to think about other things in life.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.880]   That's also been a fun part of it,
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.840]   which is you do an episode with someone, talk about health,
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.720]   and now you got to go deep on your own health,
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.880]   and now that's a big project.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.240]   I know that's one of the things
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   we're both really thinking about this year.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.400]   I thought maybe for this episode,
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.680]   it'd be fun to talk about some of the major things
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.640]   that have happened in the last month or two
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.120]   that have sparked missions or goals
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.840]   for what we want to do this coming year
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.920]   and talk about it openly.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.480]   And hopefully people find that interesting.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.960]   When I hear you talk about your side,
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.920]   I'm like, yes, please tell me taking notes,
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.600]   all that kind of good stuff.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.360]   - Yeah, and certainly right back at you.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.440]   I told you offline that a couple of your most recent episodes
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.320]   have really significantly impacted me.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.160]   No joke.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.840]   I have listened to the Bill Perkins episode.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.000]   I think it came out in mid-December.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.680]   And Dan Martell with "Buy Back Your Time."
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.720]   Listened to each of those twice already.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.880]   It's fascinating.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.160]   I consume a lot of podcasts,
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.520]   probably more than I should, frankly,
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.000]   but you never know when an idea is just gonna hit you.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.400]   And if I'm honest with myself,
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.440]   the Bill Perkins "Die With Zero" concept
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.160]   would not have resonated with me two years ago,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.760]   certainly five years ago.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.600]   It would have fallen on deaf ears completely.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.960]   I read his book, really good book, certainly,
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.080]   but it didn't impact me as much
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.320]   as hearing him on your podcast.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.000]   And then I heard him on Peter Tia's "The Drive."
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And I think just the confluence of a couple things,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.720]   so like that, and I had my buddy Dominic Cortuccio
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.440]   on our podcast on "Choose a Buy," episode 419,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.880]   just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.200]   And he was talking about your bold move for 2023.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   So his conceptual framework is,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.120]   he comes up with like one bold move
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.640]   that kind of typifies that year.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.600]   And he's been doing this now for,
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.000]   I think this is the ninth or 10th year.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.480]   And it just sounded really cool
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.160]   to A, have like an operating principle behind a year,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.400]   but also to be able to then look back
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.680]   on a decade of growth and fun and experience and say,
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.480]   "Oh, I was in that place when I did this bold move."
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.360]   And the confluence of those three things have just like,
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.640]   without sounding hyperbolic,
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.960]   just fried my brain in the best possible way.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.800]   And I think for a while,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.520]   and I'm probably a little like neurotic
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.520]   and get inside my head.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.200]   I have like, you know, prone to anxiety and such.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.240]   It was actually a little stressful, Chris.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.720]   And when I spoke with Dominic,
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.560]   I just didn't have an answer.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.080]   And then in hearing Perkins and Martel,
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   like it crystallized to me that I just need to explore more.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.200]   Like I need more fun in my life.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.960]   What I actually hit on was my healthiest year ever.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.040]   That's my kind of operating principle for 2023.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.160]   And what that means in practical terms
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.360]   is actually like loosening the purse strings.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.280]   I don't consider myself like a frugal
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.680]   or cheap person anymore.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.800]   Not that frugal and cheap are exactly synonymous,
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.480]   but obviously, you know very well,
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.720]   the old school, fine mindset of watching every penny.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.880]   I think both of us, frankly,
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.560]   have gotten a lot better with that.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.040]   So I'll let you jump in now,
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.480]   because I know that last thing is very impactful for you
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.360]   and how your mindset has changed
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.240]   just since I've met you, honestly.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.680]   - It's funny, when I first found
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.240]   the financial independence movement,
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.080]   I was like, "Oh, this is great.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.440]   "This is how I've been living my life."
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.520]   Which was like save every dollar possible,
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.960]   find every hack there is
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.400]   to spend less on everything you wanna do,
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.280]   whether it's house hacking or travel hacking or anything,
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.720]   so that I could save as much as possible.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.480]   My original goal was to do that
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.160]   because I hadn't found a career that I loved.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.000]   And I was like, "I can't work a job I don't love."
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.280]   So there was a real reason behind it.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.360]   But I feel like I went to an extreme
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.160]   that was very hard to get out of
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.640]   once I realized, "Oh, I actually do like what I do."
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.680]   And now it was very hard to do the most silly things.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.640]   Like, "Oh, I'm at a restaurant
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.560]   "and I really want a miso soup."
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.200]   But miso soup's usually $3 and this place it's $6.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.880]   And I'm like, "Ah, that just seems egregious.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.960]   "I shouldn't get this miso."
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.080]   It's like, "All I want is a miso soup."
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.840]   And we're talking about $3.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.600]   And I would get stressed out about it
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.560]   to the point that I wouldn't get the miso soup.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.840]   And my wife had ended up acting similarly.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.940]   So we would both be sitting there like,
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.860]   "All we want is a miso soup,
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.080]   "but for $6 between the two of us, we can't do it."
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.360]   But we could if it was $3.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.040]   It got to be a little crazy.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.240]   And I hadn't been able to articulate
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.040]   and process those feelings.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.880]   It's like something I'd been thinking about.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.400]   And I remember going to dinners where someone's like,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.920]   "We'll buy a really expensive bottle of wine
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.880]   "if you just put in $20."
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.040]   And I'm like, "Why would I put in $20?
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.980]   "I'm only getting a glass
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.640]   "and there's a glass on the menu for $12."
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.720]   And they're like, "Come on, just spend eight more dollars."
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.040]   Everyone's just trying to get me
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.800]   to spend a little bit more.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.060]   And when I sat down with Bill Perkins and we talked,
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.180]   I was like, "What is all of this money for?"
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.600]   That was one big component.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.960]   And then the other big component
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.280]   that I probably haven't talked a lot about
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   is that sometimes spending your money is not a net negative.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.040]   So for me, when I think about the podcast,
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.240]   I'm like, "Oh, okay."
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.640]   I've never been in a circumstance
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.040]   where the business you work at or run,
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.440]   the expenses you create for it directly affect your income.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.640]   When you work at a company,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.080]   if you spend a little bit more of the company's money,
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.480]   yes, there's an indirect trickle-down effect
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.180]   of the company being less profitable and might affect you.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.680]   But when you're owning your own business,
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.820]   if you spend all of the money the business makes,
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.980]   you don't have a salary.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.220]   Like, it's very different.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.940]   So as I think about the year ahead,
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.700]   there are opportunities to build cool products
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.860]   that everyone listening right now might benefit from
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.940]   to save money on travel, to get cool deals.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.700]   Like, I have all these ideas,
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.940]   but to go spend the time and energy to do that,
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.380]   I either need to hire people or invest more time
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.060]   or get an assistant or something.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.360]   And I struggle with that,
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.620]   even though I know that it's a good investment.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.080]   It's like, I'm gonna invest money in my own business.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.800]   So I'm trying to get better at it.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.400]   I don't have a bold move for the year,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.480]   but if I did, it would be like value my time
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.360]   or invest in myself.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.880]   Maybe it's invest in myself, but I don't know.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.280]   I feel like that might be too broad
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.560]   'cause you'd be like, "Well, is it your health?
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.400]   Is it your time?"
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.800]   And then you can just, it's hard.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.160]   And I think if there's anything I learned
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.440]   from running companies, you can't have a bunch of goals.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.560]   You need like a single theme that everything falls under.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.540]   Otherwise, you just have this endless to-do list
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.460]   and you don't know how to prioritize.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.100]   - Yeah, I hear you.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.220]   And like you said, "Oh, I could build out this thing
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.800]   to help people with travel rewards
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.540]   and it may be a good investment."
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.500]   But I think one of the operating principles
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.740]   that I operate under is actually this question
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.800]   that I ask myself is, what are you optimizing for?
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.240]   And I think it's just really impactful
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.460]   just to ask yourself that.
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.420]   And like literally ask myself that quite often.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.660]   Like, what in this situation are you optimizing for?
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:48.660]   From my daughter and what high school she's gonna go to
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.680]   is, okay, what are you optimizing for?
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.920]   Are you optimizing for signaling of,
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.160]   "Look how smart my kid is."
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.280]   Are you looking for,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.120]   "Hey, this is a nice neighborhood school
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.460]   where she could be on the marching band
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.760]   and we don't have to drive her halfway across the county."
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.600]   Like, what are you actually optimizing for?
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.480]   Are you optimizing for elite college entrants?
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.880]   So that's something that's been rolling around in my head.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.240]   And the question to ask yourself is like,
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.160]   really, what are you optimizing for?
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.800]   What would growth mean to you?
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.720]   Like in your case,
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.560]   and I'm not necessarily looking for an answer,
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.280]   it's mostly rhetorical, but is it money?
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.860]   Is it impact?
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.800]   Is it building something new the world hasn't seen
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.680]   that like only Chris Hutchins
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.240]   and his inimitable style with hacks can put together?
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.640]   Like, is it some alchemy of all three of those things
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.960]   or something that I didn't listen?
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.400]   I think it's really important to ask that from the outset
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.140]   because you might get down a road where,
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.440]   "Hey, this is a good investment.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.280]   This is gonna have impact.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.920]   But damn, if it isn't gonna take up 40 hours a week
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.400]   out of my 168, is that worth it?"
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.240]   - And I like to sleep.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.680]   So 168 just isn't a real number in my mind.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.520]   But no, it's a really valuable exercise.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.640]   I had Sahil Bloom on the podcast a week ago,
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.200]   and we just talked about doing that personal annual review.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.760]   And he has like, here are seven questions to ask yourself
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.280]   to reflect on the year past,
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.240]   which I think is just a really valuable exercise
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.040]   to try to figure out, not necessarily just to reflect,
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.700]   but things like what created energy last year
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.360]   or what drained energy?
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.760]   How do you do less of that thing
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.400]   and do more of something else?
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.040]   If that's not something that anyone listening has done,
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.880]   I would encourage it 'cause it's really helpful
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.220]   before you start planning for this year
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.680]   to figure out what worked well, what didn't work well,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.840]   what can you optimize for based on how last year went.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.120]   And then you can start to focus on
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.760]   what do I wanna focus on now?
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.440]   You and I both kind of cut our teeth
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.120]   in the financial independence world.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.880]   And I think most people think that we spend all of our time
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.000]   optimizing our money, when I think in reality,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.520]   in terms of like our investments and our savings
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.840]   and our bank accounts,
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.800]   it's like one of the few things we spend almost no time on.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.200]   It's like this funny paradox
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   of the people who care about their money the most
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   and talk about it the most
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.160]   actually spend the least amount of time thinking about it,
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.200]   use it more as a tool.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.800]   So it was funny.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.480]   Sam Parr posted this thing on Twitter where he's like,
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.440]   would you rather earn 8% guaranteed forever,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.520]   but at the expense of you can never invest in startups,
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.360]   you can never buy stocks.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.040]   And so many people were like, no, I wouldn't.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.200]   And it's like, what?
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.840]   So many people just really get caught up
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.400]   in that like eking for returns.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.000]   I don't know what your reaction was to that.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.720]   But for me, this year,
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.120]   I'm not trying to turn the dials on my investments.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.760]   I'm trying to focus on my life.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.920]   - Yeah, focus on life is the critical part.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.680]   And it is this funny paradox that for people like us
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.320]   who have always been attuned to our money,
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.880]   really our financial lives
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.560]   are the easiest part of our entire lives
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.280]   because it's on autopilot, right?
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.560]   Like that's how I have my whole financial life set up.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.000]   I kind of famously say,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.200]   I spend 10 minutes a month on my finances
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.480]   and that's maybe a little bit of an exaggeration.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.360]   It's probably ever so slightly more than that,
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.520]   but not that much more.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.640]   You set everything on autopay, autopilot.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.440]   For me, it's stress minimization.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.920]   So that's how I kind of conceptualize my finance.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.960]   I'm not looking to optimize every penny.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.720]   I'm looking to optimize for stress mitigation.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.560]   What that means in practice is
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.720]   I'll keep a little bit extra money
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.960]   sitting in my checking account,
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.160]   five or 10 grand, whatever it is, it doesn't even matter.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.320]   And then I don't have to worry about timing.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.560]   Like, oh, I have a big credit card bill this month.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.400]   Who cares?
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.240]   There's a big buffer there.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.000]   I never wanna have to think about the timing of anything.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.440]   So all of my transfers happen pretty much on autopilot,
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.320]   except for a couple of random, you know, HSA.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.520]   I max out on January 1st of every year,
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   but I have a little task in Todoist,
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.840]   which is my task manager, and it's just max out HSA.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.320]   And then I never have to think about it again.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.280]   But anyway, this thread from Sam was so interesting
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.800]   and it's especially fascinating.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.560]   So Sam Parr is one of the co-hosts
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.280]   of the My First Million podcast,
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.560]   which both you and I thoroughly enjoy.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.440]   And interestingly enough, Sean Puri is his co-host.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.280]   And he basically said,
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.800]   "I asked Sean and a few others this question.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.600]   "I'm shocked at how many said no.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.980]   "They'd prefer to buy individual stocks and other things
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.800]   "in hopes of a return greater than 8%.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.080]   "They wanna manage their own money.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.520]   "This baffles me."
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.520]   And I actually wrote back to this,
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.840]   which Sean wrote back to,
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.680]   and I don't think was altogether thrilled,
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.660]   but I said, "Baffling and just silly.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.060]   "Sean is a poker player, so he knows better.
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.080]   "The highest likelihood of success
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.720]   "over an investing lifetime
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.140]   "is to match the market with low fees.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.080]   "Everybody thinks they're Warren Buffet.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.100]   "They're not.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.860]   "Match the market and get rich.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.800]   "Find your fun in real life."
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.000]   That last part was the point that I wanted to make
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.080]   is for most people,
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   like a lot of these people on this thread
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.160]   were basically saying like,
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.840]   "Oh, but I learn so much.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.160]   "I get fun out of this."
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.100]   I mean, my argument is there's so many other ways
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.120]   to actually have fun in life.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.460]   And Sam's actual original post said,
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.200]   "You can still build your own startups.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.000]   "It's just you can't invest in this wacky stuff."
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.040]   And I think for me,
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.560]   I look at life through the lens of like a poker player
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.200]   and what increases my odds of success long-term.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.400]   So it's like the aggregation of marginal gains, right?
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.600]   1% differences might not make a difference
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.760]   in the short term,
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.720]   but over a lifetime,
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.280]   if you make the right decision
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.840]   over and over and over again, thousands of times,
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.280]   it's going to have an effect.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.300]   It's going to have a positive expected value,
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.220]   plain and simple.
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.000]   If you put a gun to someone's head and say,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.880]   "Are you gonna outperform the market net of fees
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.580]   "and net of taxes, essentially,
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.540]   "from all your wacky trading over a 50-year time period?"
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.260]   No, virtually nobody is going to outperform.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.220]   So you're willingly taking a lower net worth
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.420]   for no reason whatsoever other than to have fun
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.980]   and to just be an idiot, essentially.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.580]   And it makes no sense to me.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.820]   It's totally illogical.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.460]   I don't care how much money you have.
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.140]   You can tell this gets me hot and bothered.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.980]   It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.660]   Go out and have fun in a million other ways.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.220]   But to me, money, it's about maximizing net worth,
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.900]   especially if you can do it the brain-dead way
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.460]   by investing in index funds, right?
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.540]   Like if the easiest way possible
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.120]   to maximize your net worth is the no-brainer way,
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.220]   man, that's a win-win in every possible way.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.580]   Why would you not pick that?
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.100]   - I'll play a slight devil's advocate, which is...
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:22.940]   - I thought you might.
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.460]   - I'm not sure that picking stocks is the alternative
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.760]   that I'll put in this camp.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.980]   The question kind of carved out the ability
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.340]   to start your own companies.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.060]   But I do think that I've seen lots of people
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.500]   in my peer group and my friends at
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.480]   who've taken their money and built companies
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.180]   and taken their money and launched products
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.260]   that have generated returns that exceed what an index fund
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.180]   or a set of stocks would do, so that's true.
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.760]   I do think there is some uncontrollable instinct
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.020]   that I love this thing, I want to bet on it.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.380]   It's like betting on yourself
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.580]   because you have this belief in the world.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.940]   And I like to do that with a small part of my portfolio,
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.640]   but it's so small that it doesn't matter,
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.420]   and I would give it up if I had to.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.100]   The big thing I'll say is all of the investing advice,
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.640]   if you asked this question three years ago,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.900]   before the pandemic, and you said,
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.140]   "Stocks and bonds, how correlated are they?"
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.460]   It's like, historically, they're always not correlated.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.840]   The 60/40 portfolio is always gonna do great,
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.280]   that's why you diversify, and then it didn't.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.380]   And so I will say that as much as I don't believe
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.020]   what I'm about to say is something that you should factor in,
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.180]   I'll at least share it, which is that
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.620]   all of the knowledge we have about
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.660]   how much better index funds are than stocks,
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.980]   I mean, it's all based on what happened in the past,
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.940]   and there are all kinds of things happening
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.440]   that could mean a different future.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.660]   That said, I don't think any of the people I know
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.740]   that are choosing to make all these active trades
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.940]   and active investments are doing it for that reason.
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.380]   I think they're doing it for a different reason.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.100]   I did this episode with Brian Feraldi,
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.100]   who has a whole checklist on how to be an investor
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.460]   and invest in stocks, and he approaches stock investing
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.980]   much differently than most,
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.600]   building out a portfolio of stocks,
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.100]   almost like creating your own indexes
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.020]   and doing some kind of research and that kind of stuff.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.860]   And I would say, if that's your approach,
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.220]   then I feel a lot better, but if your approach is more,
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.200]   I just pick crazy things 'cause I wanna win,
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.140]   and I read about them on Reddit, I'm less excited.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.220]   But we could go down that rabbit hole forever.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.640]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day,
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.220]   and Viore is one of them, and I am so excited
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.180]   to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.380]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile,
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.060]   everything is designed to work out in,
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.580]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all,
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.380]   and it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.480]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.300]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.020]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.580]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.060]   And it's not just for men.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.460]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.100]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.560]   I think I have three pairs of them,
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.060]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.100]   I've ever owned.
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.920]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.980]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.900]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.060]   but they're also great for lounging,
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.300]   or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.260]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.580]   and for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.940]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.840]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.380]   If you're like me, it's about the time of year
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.980]   that you have to deal with collecting all your W-2s,
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.180]   1099s, and any other docs you need
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.740]   for this year's tax return.
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.460]   Well, thanks to Daffy, I never have to go digging
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.220]   through emails, desk drawers, or Dropbox folders
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.020]   to find my donation receipts,
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.100]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.940]   Daffy has a better system for giving
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.740]   and allows you to give to any 501(c)(3) across the U.S.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.260]   with just a few taps.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.100]   And because it houses all your charitable contributions,
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.220]   you only have one place to go at tax time,
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.580]   and you can easily make sure you're maximizing
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.420]   one of the most generous tax deductions in 2023,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.100]   charitable contributions.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.240]   Daffy does all this by helping you set up
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.420]   a donor-advised fund, or DAF,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.420]   which is a tax-advantaged account
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.820]   that lets you contribute cash or assets
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.020]   on a one-time or recurring basis,
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.220]   take the tax deduction at the time of the contribution,
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.480]   and then distribute that money
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.780]   to over 1 1/2 million charities, schools,
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.660]   and faith-based organizations whenever you want to.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.780]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.540]   to get a better system for giving.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.040]   And for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.080]   you can get a free $25 to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.080]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/DAFFY.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.860]   I think both of us, almost all of our money
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.700]   is in some form of investment account.
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.780]   I am curious, I think you manage yours on your own.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.420]   So you're doing the rebalancing,
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.060]   you're doing the tax-loss harvesting.
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.860]   I think, not because I did work at Wealthfront,
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.180]   but just because I believe that it is a better use of my time
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.620]   to not do that and to get the extra edge
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.120]   from things like direct indexing and all that kind of stuff.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.620]   Have you ever considered not managing it yourself?
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.540]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.140]   Under your advisement, I did open a Wealthfront account.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.880]   I don't know if you ever actually even knew
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.780]   that I did that or not,
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.100]   but I have been putting some money in there.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:17.100]   So just more to kind of see how the tax-loss harvesting
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.580]   worked, essentially.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.700]   And it's pretty cool, I'm not gonna lie.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.340]   There is no world where I would do that on my own.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.020]   I haven't done analysis, certainly,
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.300]   of like, is the benefit that I'm getting,
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.260]   does it outweigh the fees?
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.860]   I suspect that it does, but in all candor, I haven't.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.940]   I'm sure you have that information committed to memory.
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.860]   But in general, for me, if I were to not manage my money,
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.460]   I think it would be more psychological than anything.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.980]   I like to believe that I don't make poor decisions,
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.500]   like sell when the world is going to hell in a handbasket
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.540]   in March of 2020, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.700]   But I think I'm as susceptible to that as anyone.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.220]   So I probably have underperformed
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.940]   what I should have performed
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.100]   if I just did what I advise all the time
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.500]   and just keep pumping money and go to sleep,
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.780]   wake up in 10, 20, 30 years,
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.060]   and essentially have more money than I can imagine.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.340]   Obviously, nobody cried for me, I'm doing fine,
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.860]   I've reached financial independence.
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.380]   At the end of the day, it's fine,
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.700]   but I know in my heart of hearts,
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.500]   I've probably made suboptimal decisions based on emotion.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.980]   When we talked about, hey, like,
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.700]   the actual nuts and bolts of money is the easy part,
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.820]   I stand with that, and I hold to that, certainly,
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.540]   because I think it's precisely the psychological part
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.140]   that's really the hard part.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.660]   You let your brain get involved,
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.900]   and it just kind of does stupid crap.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.460]   I've always noticed that the financial independence community
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.660]   and myself included, always hate fees.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:45.820]   Like, it just is one of those things
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.420]   that people just hate paying fees.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.620]   And so I know that's been a lot of the aversion
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.220]   to an investment advisor, a financial advisor,
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.420]   a robo-advisor, any of those things.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.220]   And what really changed it for me one time
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.460]   was I had created this portfolio
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.340]   that was like eight index funds,
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.460]   and I was going through trying the process of rebalancing
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.140]   and managing it and all that.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.180]   And I remember at one point, I was like,
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.820]   well, what trades do I have to make?
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.940]   Do I have to sell these three to rebalance?
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.780]   And it was just like,
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.620]   I actually wasn't sure if I could make the trades.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.700]   And then I was like, well,
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.060]   I don't know if these trades are gonna have to clear
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.180]   before I can rebuy.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.100]   And so I just kept pausing, pausing, pausing,
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.740]   and I watched the market move and I was like,
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.580]   what am I doing?
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.500]   I don't think that doing this full-time
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.820]   is a priority enough that I'm doing it.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.300]   I have to offload it.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.220]   The added benefit was that things like direct indexing,
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.500]   when you can start to break apart the index fund
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.700]   and actually say, well, instead of investing in the S&P 500
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.940]   or Vanguard at VTI or VTSAX,
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.540]   you can just buy all the individual things.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.340]   Well, obviously that's completely untenable
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.420]   for a person to do and go buy hundreds and hundreds
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.620]   of stocks, but there's some advantages there
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.780]   when it comes to being able to tax loss harvest
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.460]   with a hundred or whatever number of stocks.
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.140]   So we could go down here quite a bit.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.060]   I will attempt to pull back and stay on the money theme
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.260]   and just think, okay, so we're talking about money.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.220]   We've identified not focus on that side of money,
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.620]   but what are we focused on and how do we spend it?
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.940]   Are there things that you think next year
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.840]   you're gonna spend more time thinking on
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.780]   when it comes to money or how you spend it?
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.140]   - Yeah, without a doubt.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.220]   And your podcast has kind of helped inform a lot of this.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.460]   And I think for me, it's experiences and health.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.100]   So those are the two things that at this point
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.780]   I am prioritizing.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.620]   And I think what that's gonna mean in reality
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.180]   is spending money and that's perfectly okay.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.460]   And I think Brad circa five years ago
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.660]   would not have been okay with that.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.700]   And I am now, and I think that's perfectly fine.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.420]   And I'm frankly very happy about it.
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.980]   - Are there any particular experiences
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.220]   that you're like this year, this is what I wanna spend on?
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.180]   - So you and I are both lovers of Japan
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:44.940]   and I desperately want to get back to Japan
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.820]   and I want to climb Mount Fuji.
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.540]   That is like an absolute goal of mine.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.540]   Will that happen in 2023?
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.380]   I don't know if it will or not.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.340]   So sophomore year of college over the summer,
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.420]   lived with a host family in a city called Hamamatsu.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.660]   And it was a couple hours south of Tokyo
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.260]   and the Shinkansen.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.220]   And the only time that I saw Mount Fuji
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:13.040]   was on the bullet train and it just appeared.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.100]   And obviously, you know how majestic it is.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.540]   It was the cloudy season.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.460]   And unfortunately, I only got like a couple
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.860]   little quick glimpses of it.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.200]   But I'm like, damn, I will be back there someday.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.620]   At this point, it's going on 20 plus years.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.260]   So I have not been so great with the follow through on that.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.900]   So my older daughter is now a roller coaster enthusiast,
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.180]   which is actually a thing.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.820]   Like that is an actual term, roller coaster enthusiast.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.820]   There are like massive organizations
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.700]   of these roller coaster enthusiasts throughout the world.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:45.700]   And in the town immediately adjacent to Mount Fuji
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.260]   is one of Japan's best roller coasters.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.380]   So I'm using this as like my little hook
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.340]   to get my family there.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.700]   I'd be curious to hear your thoughts.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.500]   You now have two kids and I have two,
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.140]   I guess my kids are older at this point,
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.300]   which is kind of crazy to say, but it's still hard to travel.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.220]   And we have not been as good at that
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.500]   as I wish that we were, frankly.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.540]   So the very short answer to your question is,
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.740]   yeah, I need to get back to Japan.
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:13.980]   I wanna show my family, my wife, just that amazing culture.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.460]   That's the hope on like one of the big adventures.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.300]   - So if you're listening to this
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.460]   and you haven't been to Japan, you absolutely have to.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.180]   Next week, I have an episode
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.140]   that's entirely devoted to Japan.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:23.980]   - Seriously?
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.940]   - Yeah, I sat down with Brandon Presser,
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.500]   who is a previous guest,
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.020]   who I think said has been to Japan every year
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.980]   for the last 20 years, except one.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.140]   He's written, I don't know, five or six guidebooks on Japan.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.060]   We sat down, the episode's gonna be long.
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.060]   We might even split it into two next week
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.020]   because we were talking for a couple hours.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.460]   The goal was to be a masterclass
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.780]   in planning a trip to Japan.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.380]   Overview the culture, the people, the travel, the transit,
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.740]   Tokyo, Kyoto, other places to go,
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.620]   some hotspots that he loves, unknown little corner places.
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.420]   So if Japan is anything you've ever even considered,
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.140]   you should listen and I'm gonna try to fit in
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.820]   to this incredibly long episode at the end,
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.660]   a little thing about like,
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.300]   how do you use your points and miles to get there?
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.220]   'Cause that's what I love.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.820]   Like, how do you make it an affordable trip?
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.340]   Japan is known for being expensive,
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.620]   but so is San Francisco and New York and LA.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.860]   And somehow we all find ways to get to those cities.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.260]   So yes, Japan should be on everyone's list.
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.020]   I've been four times and it's still on my list,
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.240]   but I'm gonna come back to your travel with kids thing.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.180]   And it's something I've been really thinking about.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.220]   And I actually had a really funny conversation this week
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.900]   with Tony Hawk, funny enough to bring it all together
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.740]   about travel to Japan.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.340]   When he was in his early twenties, he had a kid.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.100]   And for all we know that Tony Hawk being successful
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.000]   and famous and rich and all these things,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.260]   at that point in time of his life,
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.460]   he was anything but that, like living on ramen, everything.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.700]   And he got these demo offers in Japan
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.020]   and he couldn't afford childcare.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.620]   So he brought his kid to Japan when he was young.
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.420]   And he would be like at a skate demo with a infant
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.780]   or toddler, just like hanging out there
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.700]   because he just had to do it.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.940]   He didn't have any options.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.780]   But his advice was by doing that
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.420]   and being forced to do that,
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.860]   his kids just got so comfortable rolling with the punches.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.780]   So we took what I think was a very ambitious trip
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.180]   to Paris and London with a six month old and a two year old.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.980]   And it was nothing like a trip to London
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.940]   that you would take with no kids,
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.260]   but we learned how to make it work.
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.680]   Was it as fun as it was before?
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.540]   In many ways, no, but in a few ways, yes.
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.180]   And maybe you could argue it too in six months,
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.500]   they're not quite old enough
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.780]   to necessarily appreciate the culture,
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.340]   but they are learning how to sit on an airplane for 10 hours.
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.020]   My daughter loves airplanes.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.900]   We invest in a lot of things that are painful.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.540]   If you wanna learn how to run,
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.980]   the first getting out the gate
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.240]   and starting to run as an adult is painful.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.740]   And then it gets easier and it gets easier.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.140]   I think the same thing is true with travel with kids.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.660]   And sure, I'm gonna do an episode in 2023
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.360]   about all the travel hacks I've learned traveling with kids
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.700]   from the Stokke JetKids suitcase,
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.700]   which if you have a small kid is amazing.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.500]   It basically converts any coach seat
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.260]   into like a business class seat,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.180]   at least in the eyes of a young kid.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.680]   Does nothing for adults, by the way.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.380]   But I think you just have to do it.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.580]   The rule I heard from someone,
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.340]   just plan one thing a day, that's it.
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.080]   Your itinerary is one thing a day,
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.340]   at least when they're really young.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.580]   Now that you're way past naps and early bedtimes
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:12.540]   and the ability to not miss like five meal snack times a day
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:13.420]   like you're past that.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.220]   So I think it's gonna be a little bit more enjoyable,
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.000]   but at the young ages, I just keep telling myself,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.060]   I'm building up the travel resilience
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.060]   so that a few years when they really learn
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:22.980]   to appreciate things,
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.220]   we just have things so much more dialed in.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.460]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.300]   I like that.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.120]   And yeah, it's funny.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.020]   My kids at this point both go to sleep after me.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.020]   So I'm like the old man that goes to sleep at 9.30.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.820]   I'm like fanatical about my bedtime.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.700]   So yes, I do not have to worry about nap time anymore
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.580]   or schedules, but nevertheless, you have to make the effort.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.460]   And going back to your question about experiences,
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.480]   I think it's about making the effort.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.780]   You talked about the loneliness
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.140]   of maybe not being in the office
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.060]   and not being around people all the time.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.740]   And frankly, working at home,
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.400]   regardless of whether we have conversations
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.240]   like this or not,
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.780]   and also being financially independent and being home
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.540]   and all of your friends are at work,
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.280]   you have to make an effort to actually see people.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:14.200]   And I think it's very, very easy to get into a rut.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.340]   And I think I have been in a rut for a while
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.780]   in terms of actually making the effort
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.780]   to see people that I wanna see and do new things.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.940]   That's another thing, as you can tell,
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.100]   I'm a fanatical listener of all the hacks, right?
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.700]   Like one of the things you've talked about
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.380]   is like that one thing a month.
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.220]   - Yeah.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.180]   - And that just always resonated with me.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.060]   I thought that was super cool the first time
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.880]   that I heard you talk about that.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.320]   And the operating principles.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.500]   Like, can I be looking for adventure?
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.220]   Do I have an answer to your question right now, Chris?
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.060]   I don't.
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.380]   I could BS like, I'm gonna learn how to, I don't know,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.780]   do archery and drive a race car.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.540]   I could BS anything you wanted right now,
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:54.740]   but it's not true.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.980]   Because the only thing that I know for sure right now
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:02.980]   is like my aperture is open to experience
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.100]   and fun and connection.
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.700]   And like, those are the things that are like
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.620]   rolling around in my head of,
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.900]   hey, in conjunction with Die With Zero from Perkins,
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.180]   it's like, hey, you have some money.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.780]   You have some time.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.540]   And you have people you haven't seen in a while.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.980]   Like, what would it look like to get together with people
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.820]   and to do something just cool and different?
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.780]   And that I normally wouldn't do
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.740]   because I frankly haven't done it for years.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.780]   So I think that's where I am right now.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.280]   So yeah, the next time we do this,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.580]   hopefully I'll have an update for you.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.740]   I don't even know if I can be as adventurous as you
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.580]   with the one a month,
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.940]   but what if I tried five new things and just try to explore?
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.860]   So long story short is I'm gonna see how this rolls.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.860]   So I don't know.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:43.720]   What do you think?
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.380]   You used to do one of these a month
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:48.660]   and obviously with COVID and the world shutting down
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.180]   and you having kids,
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.620]   how has that changed and how are you looking at it now?
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.060]   - I talked earlier about my goal for the year,
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.220]   my bold move is gonna be about valuing time.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.420]   So I think what that allows you to do
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.300]   is make time for whatever that thing is,
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.460]   whether it's something you wanna learn,
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.660]   whether it's something you wanna do.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.420]   I was talking to someone the other day
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:05.260]   and they were like,
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.980]   we're going on a trip without our kids.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.900]   Our parents are gonna watch it.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.580]   And they had not done this and their youngest kid was five.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.260]   This is the first trip they're taking alone.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.260]   And it's a weekend trip.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.640]   It's not a crazy thing.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.600]   So I think you can make a lot of experiences
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.740]   that aren't the experiences of years past
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.700]   where it's like, let's take a two week backpacking trip to,
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.020]   yeah, that's a great experience.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.500]   I just pulled off the bookshelf, Ben Nempton,
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.740]   who I had on episode 36,
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.540]   who wrote this book called "The Bucket List Journal".
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.580]   And the reason I pulled it off
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.760]   is 'cause I'd encourage everyone to check this out.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.060]   We did an episode, you can get some of it there.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.860]   But he created this journal that is about
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.860]   a list that he created with some friends
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.780]   and it's an insane bucket list.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.920]   But he created a book to help people create their own.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.560]   But the thing he did that I think is so great,
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.900]   and I'm reading his do's or don'ts.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.720]   It's like, do's, go on a date a month,
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.200]   like run five miles twice a week.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   He was kind of trying to give people ideas,
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.660]   but he breaks everything into categories.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.440]   And he breaks it into travel and adventure,
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.280]   physical health, material, creative, professional,
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.560]   intellectual, financial, mental health,
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.540]   relationships, and giving.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.520]   So I wanna encourage people that when you hear us say
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.160]   experiences and things you wanna do,
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.160]   and you wanna think about how to be ambitious
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.440]   with your years ahead,
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.040]   don't assume that every experience
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.340]   needs to be like jump out of an airplane,
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.020]   or like the traditional big audacious experience thing.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.200]   One of the things that I have on my bucket list
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.780]   is to cook a seven course meal for friends.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.640]   Not necessarily go out to a fancy restaurant,
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.520]   just to make this incredible, awesome dinner
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.920]   where you think about it and you plan it
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.480]   and you shop and you do all this stuff.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.720]   Like that is an experience.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.840]   It's not jumping out of an airplane.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.120]   It's not traveling around the world.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.840]   I'm trying to prioritize things in other categories
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.520]   that I think are also really meaningful.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.040]   And so that's something I'm thinking about this year.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.880]   But when it comes to mine on valuing time,
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.160]   which I think is a big one for me,
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.920]   I wanna share some of the things I've done
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.880]   and some of the things I'm gonna do.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.220]   I think that one thing that's really unfortunate,
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.460]   I remember sharing an app to a friend of mine
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.080]   and saying, oh, this is a great app, Paprika.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.240]   It's a food app, right?
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.040]   And it's recipe management, meal planning, all this stuff.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.160]   And they were like, oh, it's expensive.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.880]   It costs, I don't know, five, 10, $20.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   So I was like, okay.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.520]   We've kind of trained ourselves to assume,
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.680]   oh, software should all be free.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.200]   Content should all be free and all that stuff,
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.240]   which is fair because it's not like we've been trained.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.920]   It's not like we just decided this.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.200]   And I have a similar problem.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.200]   I'm like, do I wanna buy an app for $20?
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.040]   This is crazy.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.400]   Most apps are free.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.600]   But then I'm trying to equate things to
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.680]   how much is this gonna make my life easier?
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.660]   And of course, $20 is a good amount.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.840]   So there are a bunch of products
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.680]   that some of which I've partnered with,
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.620]   some I haven't because I'm just such a big fan.
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.960]   So Paprika is one.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.640]   It costs money and I love it.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.000]   It saves me so much time.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.440]   We meal plan on it, we grocery shop on it.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.320]   I think it's great.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.100]   Partners of ours, Delete Me,
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:45.420]   is this site that I think is an incredible product
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:46.680]   that will basically go and remove
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.120]   all your data off the internet.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.460]   So I went pretty deep last year on cybersecurity
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.120]   and like, how do I get my data off?
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.560]   How do I make sure I'm protected?
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.880]   I did a whole two-part episode series
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.920]   where I interviewed someone
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.640]   and then did a ton of research and published it.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.640]   So you can go back and listen to those.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.320]   But that was one where I actually started
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.560]   and I was like, you know what?
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.040]   I don't know if I wanna pay for a service
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.160]   that's gonna go delete all my information off the internet.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.680]   I could just go to every individual
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.320]   data broker website and do it.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.720]   Like, why would I pay for someone to do this for me?
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.920]   And then I started doing it.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.980]   And one, I found that I spent five or 10 hours
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.820]   and I wasn't finished.
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.900]   And I was like, this is crazy.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.180]   I do not value my time.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.840]   And then two, after I did it manually,
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.680]   I was like, you know what?
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.880]   Let's at least see if I got it all.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.320]   And I didn't.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.200]   So like, I spent all these hours trying to do it.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.040]   And then I realized,
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.620]   not only could I pay someone to save me time,
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.600]   but I could pay someone to do it better than me.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.000]   So that was an interesting one and a product I love.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.240]   I use 1Password.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.440]   They're not really a partner of the show.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.640]   I think there's an affiliate link for them if you sign up,
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.720]   but I think I make a dollar.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.640]   It's not like a big deal.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.940]   It's just like, because I already love it,
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.220]   I might as well put the link in on the website.
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.360]   But just managing passwords,
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.360]   like I'm glad to pay for a service like that.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.240]   I'm glad to pay for photo storage.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.480]   We talked about money.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.100]   I love a product called Kubera, right?
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.380]   And it is a product that replaces
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.720]   your like spreadsheet balance sheet, right?
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.040]   Like that's what it replaces.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.760]   And it syncs with all of the sites.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.000]   It's a premium service.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   It's not free.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.040]   I think it's $150 a year,
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.080]   but they've worked with all the data aggregators
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.240]   so that they use the best,
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   whether it's Plaid or Yoda,
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.520]   all these ways you sync your accounts,
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.080]   the best one for each account.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.080]   And they just built all the features I want.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.560]   And now I don't spend an hour a month
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.580]   updating my balance sheet spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.500]   And it's like, if I can save 12 hours a year,
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.800]   plus get some extra insight,
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.280]   I would, of course I should be willing
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.720]   to pay something for that.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.680]   And that's something I've gotten really in tune with.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.520]   And this year going forward, I'm like,
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.760]   maybe I need to try one of these
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.180]   virtual assistant services out.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.800]   I just signed up for Fancy Hands,
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.600]   which I'm not sure if it's going to be the right fit
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.360]   because it's not really like a dedicated person
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.380]   that learns you.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.480]   But I just want to get myself comfortable
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.440]   with paying to save myself time
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.000]   because I'm using that time to be creative with my business,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.120]   which hopefully will generate revenue in the future.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.040]   I'm using this time to spend with my kids,
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.200]   which I want to do.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.920]   So that's been a really hard thing for me.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.720]   And I think one of the biggest unlocks
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.880]   was starting to pay for products and services
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.040]   that will save me time.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.080]   It starts out really easy when it's hour obvious,
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.240]   where it's like, I'm going to have someone
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.860]   help clean my house,
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.940]   which I know would take me this many hours,
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.160]   but I'm trying to extend that to,
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.920]   I'm going to use this software that's going to save me time.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.320]   Or I'm going to buy this product that costs more,
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.440]   but it's going to save me time.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.320]   Are you good at that?
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.440]   - I'm getting better.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.280]   I'm trying.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.840]   I share the same affliction that you share,
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.520]   which is, oh, of course I can do this on my own.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.360]   Or of course, if that's going to cost a couple hundred
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.920]   dollars, I can do it.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.120]   I can do it just the same.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.240]   But like you said,
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.640]   it almost invariably takes way longer than you anticipate.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.440]   And in the case of Delete Me,
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.920]   you don't do as good a job, right?
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.080]   I think I'm a work in progress on a lot of this stuff.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.800]   It's just reorienting,
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.500]   even down to meal planning and cooking meals at home.
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:03.120]   So for years, we have, I guess at chooseava.com/meals,
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.520]   we have a PDF of like 30 recipes that she's curated.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.520]   They're not like her recipes.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.220]   They're recipes she's curated over the years of essentially,
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.480]   it was like $2 per person per meal.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.320]   And these are fabulous, delicious meals,
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.800]   like our like A+ meals in essence.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.920]   And that's been fantastic.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.080]   And we meal plan and we save time, we save money, et cetera.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.320]   But it's still a lot of hours.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.840]   And not to mention on the front side,
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.800]   but on the backside too,
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.960]   like you don't think about this, the cleanup, right?
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.320]   Like if you're cleaning up pans every single time
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.400]   and putting all the dishes away,
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.680]   it's like 20 plus minutes for each of us.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.040]   That's 40 person minutes, right?
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.440]   And then when you think about that times seven
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.440]   or times how many of our meals per week,
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.120]   it's just an absurd amount of time.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.540]   I think we've been much more cognizant of our time recently.
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.800]   So we're actually spending significantly more
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.480]   on food recently and still in the cosmic scheme of things,
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.400]   it's not that much Chris,
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.320]   but we're able to get delicious food
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.760]   from one of our favorite restaurants.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.120]   And it winds up being like $5 per person per meal.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.000]   And they cook it for you.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.680]   They have this like amazing, they call it like Sunday supper.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.320]   And the way that it works is you can get enough food
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.580]   that for us, it lasts four dinners for the rest of the week.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.680]   It's like $50.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.200]   It's absurdly cheap.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.000]   - Brad doesn't live in the Bay area for anyone listening,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.680]   where dinner for four that doesn't last the whole week
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.960]   is like more than $50.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.800]   (laughing)
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.560]   - Yes, I am in a low cost of living area.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.760]   I'm in Richmond, VA, but yeah, it's fun.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.120]   Like it's actually fun
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.560]   because there's a new menu every week.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.080]   We try something new.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.760]   My wife, this is the way that things have been delivering
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.920]   in our house 'cause she generally likes cooking.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.220]   She's always been the one who made the food
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.640]   and she's been doing that for a long time.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.680]   Especially when you have kids
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.160]   who we got into the bad habit
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.920]   of making different meals for people,
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.720]   which I don't advise at all.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.840]   And she's just kind of done with it.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.880]   It's a lot of fun, frankly, to like try new food every week.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.600]   And we don't have nearly as much,
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.940]   obviously on the front side, but on the backside also,
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.200]   they give you the pans to cook these things in.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.080]   There's no cleanup.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.860]   So it's just, well, damn, would I pay $3 extra a meal
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.880]   to not have to waste an hour of prep time and cleanup time?
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.040]   Of course I would, a hundred times out of a hundred.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.680]   And the food frankly is as good or better
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.680]   and it's different every week.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.920]   We actually just recently hired someone
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:28.000]   to clean the house once a month and that's been great.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.380]   Just like little things.
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.360]   I think I'm kind of dipping my toe in here.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.840]   I'm not maybe quite as advanced as you at this point
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.040]   in terms of like the virtual assistants and things like that.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.360]   I'm open to it.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.640]   I think it's just more like, I need to conceptualize.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.240]   Like, what does that actually look like?
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.320]   How are you thinking about that?
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.800]   - Well, I did this episode with Dan Martell
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.300]   that you already referenced about buying back your time.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.200]   And I consider Dan, having talked to him,
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.280]   to be like the pro.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.880]   I'm like, you don't spend one second of your day
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.160]   on something that isn't a good use of your time.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.600]   And I'm not sure I have the roadmap
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.120]   on how to exactly get there.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.400]   And some of the things he's doing require more capital
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.920]   than I'm willing to spend on it, but I'm working on it.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.140]   We experimented with hiring someone to drop off meals
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:09.480]   and do the preparation.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.720]   We're trying to go out or do carry out a couple nights a week
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.000]   just to give ourselves a break.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.800]   We built bulk cook so that we have enough meals
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.720]   for another day.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.420]   I hope to have an update in the next time we chat,
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:23.040]   which is some of the experiments and the results of them.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.080]   - Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.820]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.640]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.240]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.760]   without our consent.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:37.720]   I found a listing for my dad on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:41.680]   that had his name, age, address, phone number, email,
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.560]   past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:49.080]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.360]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours finding all the sites
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.200]   with his info and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.440]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine,
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.760]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.700]   for this episode.
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:04.680]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.760]   and remove your personal information
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.560]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.680]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.320]   and get that removed as well.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.520]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes over 2,000 pieces
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.960]   of data for a customer in their first two years,
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.640]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.000]   of data for their customers.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.560]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.540]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:34.520]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme and get 20% off a plan
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.100]   for you or your entire family.
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:41.080]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.920]   If you wanna keep learning from the world's best minds
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.380]   anytime, anywhere, and at your own pace,
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.560]   you have to check out MasterClass,
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.140]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.540]   With over 2,500 classes from a range
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.400]   of world-class instructors like Steph Curry,
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.620]   Richard Branson, and Martin Scorsese,
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:01.620]   that thing you've always wanted to do
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.560]   is way closer than you think.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.000]   When I signed up a few years ago,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.560]   I jumped straight into an amazing cooking class
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.420]   by Thomas Keller that has totally leveled up my skills
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.360]   in the kitchen.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.840]   I also really enjoyed FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss'
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.920]   class on the art of negotiation.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.600]   And with every class I've taken,
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.580]   I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.760]   the instructors have and the quality of the experience.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.340]   And a MasterClass membership makes such a good gift

[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.800]   are there any other money things
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.660]   you're thinking about going forward?
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.680]   - I am kind of at a crossroads
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.880]   with my real estate investing.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.360]   So I know a bunch of our listeners
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.960]   have asked for an update with this is,
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:16.980]   I went to buying,
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.360]   and I don't know if I ever told you this,
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.440]   but two single family rental properties
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.960]   down in Georgia a couple of years ago.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.240]   It's probably three or four years ago at this point.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.680]   And I've never liked real estate.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.520]   Kind of scares me.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.960]   I had a bad experience of like kind of speculation
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.680]   back in my 20s, and it just scarred me for life.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.240]   I've gotten over it to a large degree
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.160]   in terms of like, okay, idiot,
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.800]   don't look at this as like,
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.040]   you're gonna make a quick buck.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:41.860]   This is gonna go up.
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.220]   Like, look at it as a business.
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:44.060]   I'm a CPI.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.000]   I should be looking at this as a business.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.200]   And does it have cashflow?
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.520]   Is there positive net income?
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.020]   And what's the return on investment?
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:54.400]   So I actually bought both these properties in cash
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.940]   and they've been great.
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.920]   They've returned phenomenally.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.600]   Like the bigger pockets, 1% rule.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.400]   Now, obviously for anybody in the Bay Area,
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.640]   or like this is for your own personal residence,
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.960]   this is laughable.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.320]   But for an investment property in rural Georgia
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.680]   or in Alabama or in many places throughout the country,
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:17.160]   you can find it's like 1% of the purchase price
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.960]   as the monthly rent.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.280]   So now for instance, I bought these properties
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.120]   after renovation, I bought them for basically $55,000 a piece.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.620]   So 1% of that would be $550 a month.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:33.160]   So that would be then like a 12% gross return per year.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.000]   But actually, Chris, I rent them for like 750 and 800 a month.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.440]   So it's like one and a half percent, which is phenomenal.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.120]   And so far, and it's a small sample size, obviously,
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:46.700]   but I haven't been hit with any major extraordinary expenses.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.200]   Obviously, there's always stuff that comes up as a homeowner
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.340]   or a landlord, but they've returned phenomenally.
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:55.640]   And then that brings the question, OK, yeah,
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.280]   I kind of don't love real estate,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.440]   but these have been like an unmitigated success.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.160]   And then I had Alan Corey on the podcast a couple of weeks
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.160]   ago talking about, hey, maybe that sounds great,
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.760]   but what would that have looked like if you had bought eight
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:16.680]   of these with 25% down instead of two with 100% cash,
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.240]   in essence?
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.000]   Those index funds, they're so easy.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:19.920]   There's no overhead.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.200]   Oh, index funds are so easy.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.200]   And that's the constant tension in my life
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.840]   is I just want simplicity.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.160]   Simplicity is everything to me.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.160]   But the diversification--
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.040]   Chasing those returns.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.040]   Yeah, those returns.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.240]   That's what it comes down to.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.200]   You can know intellectually, but damn,
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.560]   those returns are great, right?
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.440]   And is that a small sample size?
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.880]   Is this replicable?
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.880]   Am I going to not sleep as well at night
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.880]   if I have a mortgage on something?
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.120]   So these are all kind of rolling around in my head.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.120]   What are your time-adjusted returns?
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.580]   Because I promise you that buying that rental property
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.200]   and managing that rental property
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.440]   has a cost of time that is greater than how long it
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.680]   took you to buy VTI or VTSX or whatever index fund.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.720]   And I don't know if there's an easy way to factor that in,
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.920]   but I don't know.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.400]   For me, the only real estate that we
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.200]   have other than our primary residence
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.800]   is a fractional home that we stay in, and that's it.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.360]   We're not trying to rent it out.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.660]   We're not trying to make money.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.840]   It's just a good way for us to be able to have
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:22.040]   another place to go to.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.340]   I've always struggled with this.
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.960]   I did this episode with Brandon Turner,
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.460]   and he has a real estate empire and has amassed a net worth far
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.880]   greater than both of us combined through real estate.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.840]   But every time I think about it, I'm just like,
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.500]   I don't know if I want to play the game.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:36.580]   It doesn't excite me.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:40.200]   Being a landlord is not fun for me in any scalable thing.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.080]   I just published a newsletter, as we're recording this today,
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.400]   but last week, about house hacking.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.320]   Love that concept.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.700]   If we could build an ADU in our house, it would be awesome.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:51.700]   Being a one-off landlord and taking on that kind of little
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.320]   work is not too much, but actually turning it
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.180]   into a profession and doing it, it's for a lot of people.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.300]   And I think a lot of people do really well with it.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.800]   My brother and sister-in-law, they've
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.600]   bought up a bunch of auto repair and tire shops.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.740]   There are a lot of businesses that you can own,
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.400]   and they can be very successful, and you
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.620]   could do well with them.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:09.660]   That's just not what I want to do.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:10.900]   But they've done a great job.
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:13.500]   And it's funny how real estate seems
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:17.180]   like the obvious alternative of what to do with your money.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.940]   But then you listen to someone like Cody Sanchez, who's
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.060]   going to be coming on the podcast soon,
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.680]   and she's like, I'm buying laundromats.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.020]   I'm buying all these businesses.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.840]   There's lots of ways you can buy businesses, one of which
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.160]   is a rental property.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.220]   But do you want to do that professionally or not?
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.500]   And what is the opportunity cost?
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.980]   If you put a little bit more of time instead of into that
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.540]   into your side hustle, or to your day job,
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.620]   or to the company you run, or something,
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.540]   will that be as lucrative in the long run?
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.040]   It's hard to compare because there's
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:48.660]   no average return on investment of spending time
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.820]   on your side hustle.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:53.620]   But I encourage people to realize that real estate has
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:56.180]   a time component that, if you don't love,
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.980]   can feel like a lot of work.
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:00.500]   Yeah, and I think a lot of the real estate people
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.980]   who pontificate about how wonderful it is,
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:06.740]   I think there's a large degree of survivorship bias to it.
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:08.860]   Frankly, you don't hear about all the people
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.940]   that got wrecked by leverage and just made stupid decisions.
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.340]   I think there's some aspect of that, certainly.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:16.580]   And no matter how I run the numbers,
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:18.500]   even without factoring in leverage--
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.540]   because any time you factor in leverage,
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.180]   there's always that risk of this going kaboom.
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.900]   Let's be perfectly honest with ourselves.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.780]   But without leverage, even that 1% rule,
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:31.140]   there are very few people, very few markets in the country
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.260]   that can find that 1% rule.
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.820]   Again, 1% of the purchase price per month in rent.
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.580]   Yeah, you're not going to find it here.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.220]   Right, no, not in a million years.
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:40.820]   In the Bay Area, that's for damn sure.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.740]   And I mean, that's a 12% gross return.
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.460]   And then, again, bigger pockets.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:46.940]   You mentioned Brandon Turner.
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:52.860]   They say you should anticipate about 50% of the gross rent
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.660]   as expenses.
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:56:00.780]   So OK, your 12% gross return turns into a 6% net return.
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:01.980]   6%.
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.180]   That's not so fantastic.
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:05.060]   And then, obviously, there's appreciation.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:07.940]   But appreciation, in my opinion, is speculation.
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.380]   You cannot bank on appreciation by any means.
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.620]   So it's speculative.
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:15.060]   But that said, you can anticipate a couple percent
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:15.740]   appreciation.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:20.140]   So we're still back at 7%, 8%, 9%,
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.820]   which is pretty analogous to what we anticipate
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:23.660]   in the stock market.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:25.820]   And like you said, it's a whole hell of a lot easier
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:31.620]   to buy VTI or VTSAX than it is to run a real estate rental
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:33.900]   company, if you will, or whatever you want to conceptualize
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:34.380]   it as.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:36.620]   So is the juice worth the squeeze?
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:39.340]   I think if you like it, great.
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:44.100]   If you enjoy that, like I enjoy optimizing my travel, great.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.580]   I think it's awesome.
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:47.300]   But just don't go into it thinking it's
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.740]   the best thing in the world.
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:49.380]   Teach his own.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.100]   Teach his own.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.380]   There are people that love it.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:54.180]   But without leverage being included,
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:56.620]   because leverage can go both ways,
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:59.740]   it's no better than essentially anything else.
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.580]   And obviously, again, the real estate people
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.660]   will pontificate about the tax benefits and the 1031
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:05.420]   and all this stuff.
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:06.860]   There is that to some degree.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.060]   But like you said, you got to factor in your time
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:09.620]   a little bit.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.140]   I think that's important.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.860]   So the only other money thing I had
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:15.460]   was that we have an au pair from Italy.
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:16.340]   She's amazing.
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.700]   Our last few au pairs didn't drive, but she does.
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.340]   And we're adding her to our insurance.
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.220]   And when you add someone who hasn't ever
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.660]   had a license in the US, who's under 25,
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.860]   your insurance goes up.
[00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:29.220]   And so that inspired me to start going to reprice my insurance.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.380]   And I'm going to do an episode all about insurance,
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:32.980]   so keep an ear out for it.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:35.500]   But I would just say it's amazing
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:39.260]   that every few years, different insurance companies completely
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.860]   change the way they price different things.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.260]   And I've consistently in my life found
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.620]   that every couple of years, I just send all--
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.380]   I keep it in a nice, easy formatted thing
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.220]   where I'm like, here's the level of coverage we need.
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.820]   Here's all the things we need to cover.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:55.380]   And I'll just send it to a few insurance reps or brokers
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.940]   and be like, hey, could you give me some quotes for this?
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.060]   Because for some reason in California now,
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.740]   most of the websites don't let you price yourself anymore.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:03.860]   This is just my experience.
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.820]   I went to State Farm, couldn't price it myself.
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.160]   So I had to email it to someone.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.220]   But I did that.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.740]   And sure enough, I think I'm going
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:12.700]   to save $600, $700 a year on insurance.
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.820]   Might even be closer to $1,000 just
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.420]   by shopping around and repricing.
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:19.060]   So that's my little fun thing for 2023
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.060]   is if you haven't repriced your insurance in a little while,
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.180]   especially if you've got your home or your rental,
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.540]   you've got your car, maybe you've
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.380]   got an umbrella policy, you start to add all the things up,
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.780]   could be worth shopping around and getting a deal.
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:34.820]   Yeah, I think there are a lot of these little one-time-a-year
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.420]   things that you should do that a lot of us don't do, frankly.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:39.660]   But at least to be mindful of it, like I said,
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:41.500]   throw it in some task list that you
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:43.020]   have come up in mid-January.
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:44.740]   And you could do it more often.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.580]   But frankly, is the juice worth the squeeze?
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:49.780]   So I think one-time-a-year, price insurance.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.860]   One-time-a-year, hopefully at minimum but certainly
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.860]   one-time-a-year, go through your credit card bill.
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.500]   Just line by line, are there any recurring things
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.100]   that you just forgot about?
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:02.300]   This happened to me a couple of times with random Peacock
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:05.260]   or Hulu or some kind of Paramount Plus or some such.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.700]   And like, oh, I wanted to watch Top Gun Maverick,
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:08.860]   so I got Paramount Plus.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.660]   And I'm probably going to be paying
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.700]   for that for a couple of months because I'm stupid
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:14.940]   and I didn't cancel it.
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:17.380]   Just use Rocket-- look, they're a partner of the show.
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:18.800]   They're not paying me to say this,
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.340]   but Rocket Money is so good at this.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.300]   Do tell.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:24.780]   Free app, you sync your cards, and then they
[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:26.420]   scan for things that are recurring.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:28.220]   And then they just give you an easy view
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:29.420]   of here are your recurring subscriptions.
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:29.980]   That's cool.
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.740]   Now, their business model is, OK,
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.460]   is there a recurring subscription?
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:35.500]   You can go cancel it.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.060]   Or you could just tap one button,
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:38.500]   be like, go cancel it for me.
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.700]   And you need their premium subscription to do that.
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.180]   But then they'll go reach out to whatever company is
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:44.380]   and just cancel it for you.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.980]   And depending on the state you live in-- in California,
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.260]   companies are required to let you opt out online.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.980]   But if you have a New York Times subscription
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:51.900]   and you don't live in California,
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:52.860]   it's so hard to cancel.
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:54.260]   By the way, if you don't live in California
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.500]   and you have things to cancel, next time you're in California,
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:57.620]   just go online and do that.
[00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.620]   Or if you have a VPN that has a California option,
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.220]   it's really easy to cancel online here.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:02.980]   That's very cool.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.540]   Now, it's certainly very timely, as I'm
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.700]   talking about doing it manually.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.740]   We're talking about saving time.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.060]   Saving time, saving time.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:08.980]   That's the whole game.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.540]   But when you do reprice your insurance,
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.620]   make sure you actually look at how many miles you
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:13.420]   drive on your car.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.060]   So we don't drive that much.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:18.260]   And so one of our car policies is priced at 5,000 miles
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.580]   a year, one's at 3,000.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:21.460]   But if you don't tell your insurance company,
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.580]   they price it at like 10,000 or 12,000 a year.
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.900]   And you can actually save a ton of money
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.060]   if you don't use your car a lot.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.220]   I think a lot of us now that we're working from home more
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.180]   might not be driving as much as you used to.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.220]   So you might be overpaying for insurance,
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.840]   even without switching carriers, just
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.540]   because you didn't tell them that you're
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:39.100]   using less than whatever they set as your average mileage.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.020]   That's a cool tip.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:40.660]   I like that.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.820]   I mean, that's easy, right?
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.580]   Like, hey, just a quick email, quick phone call.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.340]   That's cool.
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.620]   I think we're describing, like, how do you do simple things
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.540]   that it's just not going to take a ton of time?
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:53.040]   And you've heard me reference Todoist a bunch of times here.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:57.740]   But I want to offload everything out of my brain, everything.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.420]   So I have all of these recurring tasks.
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.300]   And I don't think that's the best answer.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.500]   Knowing you, you have some better answer than Todoist.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.880]   I don't doubt it for one second.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:13.200]   But for me, it's like, OK, if I am 100% essentially adamant
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.800]   about putting everything in my life into Todoist,
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.400]   then I don't have to think about it ever again.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.880]   So if a task comes up, even down to-- like,
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.520]   I just renewed global entry.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.920]   And literally, the next time I have to renew is 2027.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.560]   So I just quite literally put the task in.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.880]   It comes due July of 2027 for February 2027.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.600]   And now I never have to think about that ever again.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.880]   Because I know when 2027 rolls around February,
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.840]   I'm going to see that.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.840]   And I have the URL for where I need to renew.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.720]   And it's just there.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.200]   The psychological baggage of getting all of this nonsense
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.120]   out of your head, when you free that,
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.600]   it's like the most freeing feeling you'll ever experience.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.120]   Think about all of those things that
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.120]   are rattling around in most people's heads of,
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.440]   oh, I have to do this next week.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.680]   And I have to make that phone call two weeks from now,
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.720]   whatever.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.840]   You don't have to do that.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.560]   Just get it out of your head.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.240]   Put it, in this case, on digital paper.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.960]   And your life is so much better.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.440]   So that is probably the thing that
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.080]   has improved my life most significantly
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.720]   in the last couple of years.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.440]   But again, like I said, you have to be 100% compliant with it.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.360]   Because if you're not, then you'll always
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.360]   have that nagging doubt that, oh, is it really in there?
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.960]   Can I really trust this?
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.040]   But when you can trust it 100%, you're golden.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.960]   So I don't know.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.600]   Do you use anything like that?
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.640]   I do not have a good system like that.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.560]   I do use this app called Trustworthy,
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.280]   which I'll call the family operating system, where
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.840]   you can basically store all of your IDs,
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.960]   your vaccination cards, your passports, your tax returns.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.560]   It's like a secure, organized repository.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.240]   You could have a Dropbox folder and put all this there.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.880]   But it's not as organized.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.840]   This has an app.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.080]   So when I'm at the doctor's office, and they're like,
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.600]   can we reconfirm your daughter's insurance?
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.440]   I'm like, yes, I know where her insurance card is.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.360]   You get in a car accident, where's your car insurance?
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.560]   I know exactly where that is.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.360]   And then on top of that, I like it
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.800]   because you can nominate a person, which for us
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.440]   is like my sister-in-law and my wife.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.520]   It's like, if something were to happen to you,
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.840]   let these people, through some verification,
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.600]   have access to all of our stuff.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.880]   So we just store all of our stuff there.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.480]   And it actually has a feature like this.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.480]   You upload your passport or your driver's license,
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.080]   and you put in the expiration date.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.440]   And then they remind you, hey, your driver's license
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.440]   expires in six months.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.440]   So it's a little bit different in that it's not
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.880]   a central repository.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.480]   But for a lot of those kind of expiring things,
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.600]   I have that in there.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.480]   But I have not found a task management solution that I love.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.400]   I got to work on that.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.560]   But we are well on our way to filling an episode.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.920]   And we had a whole topic of health.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.160]   Do we want to jump into that?
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.840]   Do we want to do that again the next time?
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.600]   What do you think?
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.600]   Maybe we give a quick overview, because I suspect
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.640]   with a lot of this stuff, we're at the beginning of the year
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.160]   here.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.400]   We're both exploring.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.920]   And I think what could be cool is
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.880]   for there to be some accountability
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.960]   to the audience of, hey, we're going to actually follow
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.360]   through on this.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.480]   Because I think that's what we tell our audience
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.360]   all the time is, it's great to take in information,
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.280]   and that's all well and good.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.760]   But if you don't take action, it's all worthless.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.320]   So you have to get up off the couch and take action.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.720]   Also, frankly, I fall down on this a lot.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.880]   There are probably dozens of things
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.480]   that I promised over the years that, oh, I'm going to do this,
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.840]   and I don't follow up, because there's no accountability.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.600]   So it would be pretty cool, maybe on some level,
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.280]   for us to be accountability partners,
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.040]   and then by extension, the audience to some degree.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.720]   I don't have a prepared list of things
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.360]   I want you and the audience to hold me accountable for when
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.720]   it comes to some of these things.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.760]   I know you have a few on health.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.960]   Why don't we set the stage for this at a high level
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.920]   and say, look, health is a big thing for us.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.640]   We want to spend some time focused on it.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.560]   So one, if this is interesting as an episode,
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.840]   definitely reach out to Brad.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.160]   If you're listening to all the hacks, reach out to me.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.440]   If you're listening to us, reach out to both of us.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.000]   It doesn't matter.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.080]   But let us know, so we know, should we keep this up?
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:54.960]   Should we keep doing this?
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.240]   You don't have to send a long email.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.200]   You can send Chris at all the hacks and say, do Brad again.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.000]   I'd rather get the feedback than get this really nice response.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.240]   Whether it's on social or email or whatever format you like,
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.120]   I'd love to know what people think of this,
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.400]   so we can come back and finish this whole health thing.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.160]   What do you think?
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.040]   That's a great idea.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.560]   Same for either your audience or mine.
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.160]   Go to chooseavi.com or just get on my newsletter
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.440]   at chooseavi.com/subscribe.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.400]   When you hit reply, it literally comes to me.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.600]   So I'm the one who'll be reading all those emails.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.440]   So let us know what you think about this.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.640]   We kind of conceptualize this as, like you said,
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.480]   a conversation, just kind of a random show of, hey,
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.680]   what's going on in our lives?
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.200]   And I think just to set the stage for this,
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.720]   certainly for next time, is, yeah, I think my bold move,
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.520]   as I talked about with that episode with Dominic Cortuccio,
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.680]   is I want this to be my healthiest year ever.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:48.040]   I don't precisely know today how I can quantify that.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.080]   But I'm not letting that limit me.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.600]   With my kind of over-anxiety analytical brain,
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.680]   I would have let that be the limiting factor
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.200]   and not gotten started.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.120]   But I'm going in with an open mind of, hey,
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.000]   I want to experiment.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.040]   So just a couple of things that I've
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.600]   been doing so far which I think have made a big difference.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.680]   First, Chris, you know more than anybody,
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.800]   I am a massive fanboy of Dr. Peter Attia.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.360]   I've been following him since, I think,
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.840]   episode 50 of The Tim Ferriss Show, which came out maybe
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:19.040]   nine years ago, plus or minus, which is crazy.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:23.880]   He's a pretty high-performing athlete throughout his life.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.400]   And a couple of years back, he decided
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.960]   to what seemed like basically stop
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:33.040]   a lot of his heavy training in favor of this program called
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:37.720]   DNS, so it's Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.040]   And it sounded fascinating to me,
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.040]   because I'd kind of been plagued with some shoulder issues
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:43.840]   and neck issues.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.520]   And everything that I tried was always a band-aid.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.640]   There was no actual substantive fix to it.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.320]   And the more I learned about DNS,
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.760]   the more that I thought this could be the answer.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.960]   There aren't that many DNS practitioners in the US,
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.960]   but luckily, there's one here in Richmond.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.160]   And I've been going to him for the last month
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.520]   or two at this point.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.640]   And Chris, I kid you not, it has been the best thing
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.320]   that I've ever done for my body.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.800]   I feel so much better, because it actually
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.440]   looks at the brain and nervous system
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.840]   as almost going back to developmental milestones
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.440]   from when we were infants.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.520]   And if you missed a milestone, it's
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.680]   not like you were incapacitated for the rest of your life.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.600]   Obviously, I've been a fairly normal person.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.960]   But you always are coming up with some workaround.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.680]   And what that leads to in a lot of cases
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.000]   is injury and/or stress in certain spots.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.200]   So very long story short, because again, we'll
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.480]   talk about this more in depth, is my neck and my hip flexors,
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.200]   which are constantly tight, have never felt better.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.160]   I wake up in the morning, and I'm like, holy cow.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.080]   I can move my hips in a way that I didn't think was possible.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.720]   Like, I didn't think it was possible
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.160]   that I could feel this good.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.280]   And that's just from a handful of times
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.640]   going to this DNS doctor.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.960]   And again, with the experimenting and not
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.040]   worrying about money and just trying to explore this,
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.000]   it's fairly expensive.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.320]   That's not covered by insurance.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.880]   I'm paying out of pocket every single time I go.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.520]   But it's working.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.840]   And I would be foolish, in my opinion, to not do it
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.920]   and to not continue just over dollars, which, as Perkins
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.320]   would say, when you wake up and you're 85
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.480]   and you have more money than you could ever use,
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.840]   are you going to look back on whatever?
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.040]   And now he would talk about experiences and memory
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.340]   dividends and all these things.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:34.480]   But in my case, I might get extra years of vitality
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.040]   out of spending this money.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.720]   So to me, it's an absolute no-brainer.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.360]   The other thing is morning walks.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.800]   I also listen to the Huberman Lab podcast a ton.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.440]   So he's always talking about getting morning sunlight.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.920]   Easiest way to do that is just go on a walk.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.560]   And it's just wonderful to be out in nature,
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.520]   peaceful in the morning.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.560]   Nobody's around.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.960]   You get some morning sunlight.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.840]   It's just been these add-on effects.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.360]   The third and biggest thing, though this is the newest,
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.860]   so I don't have all that much to it,
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:04.040]   is I hired an online fitness coach who I found through
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:08.120]   Twitter that I believed in what he was espousing.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.320]   And he wound up having this program.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.140]   And now, like I said before, I'm going
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:16.480]   in to the gym with Jonathan, my Choose a Vibe business
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.160]   partner, four times a week.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.800]   And it's just awesome.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.480]   It's also, frankly, like I talked about,
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:24.080]   making the effort for connection is now
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.600]   I get to hang out with my buddy Jonathan six to eight hours
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.120]   a week when I wasn't previously.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.560]   I am working towards something because I
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.720]   think that's the other thing.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.280]   Like, I'm in reasonably good shape.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.000]   So it's not like I'm going from couch potato
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.880]   to trying to be Mr. Olympia.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.220]   That's not what we're doing here.
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:43.920]   But when I go into the gym, when I go into CrossFit, I love it,
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.200]   but it doesn't feel like I'm working towards something.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.240]   I think having goals and having tangible improvements
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.240]   and having an accountability partner
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.080]   are really going to benefit me.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.080]   We're in week two here.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.280]   This is workout number eight.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.800]   So it's a very small sample size.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.400]   But I think the conjunction of all of these things
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.960]   are really working pretty well.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.400]   And then it's a mindset of exploration
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.680]   and just wanting to be as healthy as I possibly can.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.760]   Because, frankly, I'm 43 years old, which I still
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.520]   can't believe, and not getting any younger, obviously.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   And the time is now.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.640]   That's how I'm thinking about it.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.320]   I'm turning 39 this year.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.800]   And my goal is to dial in health before I turn 40.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.840]   I did an episode with Dr. Jordan Shlain.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.160]   We talked about I've got high cholesterol and then
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.000]   the impact of that.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.120]   That's the thing that I'm tackling first.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:35.080]   And through a combo of both medicine and lifestyle changes.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.840]   But I'm very early in that journey.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.280]   When you have two small kids and you start a podcast
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.600]   and you go full time on it, I felt like for a while
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.800]   I was treading water.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.480]   And now I'm like, OK, we're starting
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.800]   to get things dialed in.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.960]   Need to get the exercise back on the regular regime.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.600]   I think we've been doing well with food.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.840]   So I'm not too worried there.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.960]   But that's the big one I'm focused on right now.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.360]   Going back to very early conversation,
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.080]   I was talking about apps and how it's crazy to spend money.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.840]   It's crazy how medical things are the same.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.400]   It seems wild to pay for a doctor that
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.040]   isn't covered by your insurance, or to pay for a treatment,
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.160]   or to pay to get blood work done,
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.880]   or blood analysis, or DNA analysis, all these things.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:18.040]   But it also seems crazy to not allocate
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.280]   some portion of your budget to your health.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.200]   And so we actually had a conversation
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.120]   on that episode a few weeks ago about how
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.800]   do you think about what to allocate
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.320]   in your budget towards health?
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.680]   And after the fact, I emailed Jordan.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.600]   I was like, hey, I'm thinking about a doctor.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.040]   So Jordan runs a concierge practice that, for me,
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.640]   is not within the budget that I want for my health.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.760]   It's quite expensive.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.440]   But I was like, do you know someone
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.000]   that I could work with that's not as expensive?
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.040]   And he was like, what's your budget?
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.160]   And I was like, I don't know.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.000]   And then I asked Amy.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.520]   And I was like, what's our budget for health?
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.720]   And we're like, I don't know.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.000]   So it's something that I need an answer to,
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.520]   because I'm not necessarily always the budgeting type.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.440]   But a budget gives you permission to spend.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.800]   And so in some areas, I feel like I don't necessarily
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.440]   need a budget.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.800]   I know what's a reasonable amount
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.280]   to spend just instinctively.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.160]   But with health, I feel like I need to create a budget.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.720]   And I might even start doing this with an FSA,
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.400]   though open enrollment just ended,
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.520]   so I've got to wait a year.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.000]   But I feel like I need to force myself
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.840]   to be comfortable spending money on health.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.520]   And if I could create a budget that says,
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.680]   you have $2,000 to spend on health,
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.280]   then maybe the answer is you say, whatever's not here,
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.560]   we're going to give away.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.760]   Something that makes it a little bit more accountable.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.960]   With an FSA, it would be like that.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.560]   Whatever you don't spend, you actually can't use.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.240]   You lose it.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.520]   I would encourage anyone who has an expiring FSA
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.760]   to go buy stuff that a local shelter needs
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.360]   and don't let it go to waste.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.280]   But I want to create something there,
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.040]   because I feel like I need to force myself
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.160]   to spend more on my health.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:40.640]   That's a big one.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.520]   We had a whole list of 10 or 12 bullets
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.240]   of what we want to focus on with health.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.000]   We're going to have to save that for the next time.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.040]   Yeah, to be continued.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.560]   We didn't get to travel and some of that stuff.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.240]   So we got a lot.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.080]   Kids, Brad's superpower is teaching his kids
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.120]   all these amazing lessons.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.440]   So we're going to get to that.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.880]   But I feel like we hit on a lot.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.160]   I'm like jazzed to go do a lot of the things
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.480]   we talked about that you shared.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.880]   This is awesome.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.440]   Yeah, I knew this was going to be fun.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.520]   It worked out even better than I anticipated.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.600]   And it's pretty wild.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.160]   We have so many of these things, A, to follow up on.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.560]   This will be some accountability.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:13.600]   But B, there's all these topics we didn't get to.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.960]   I'm up for doing this a handful of times a year minimum.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.200]   I think this would be awesome.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.720]   I think it'll be fun and super valuable, obviously.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.480]   It's always good to talk to you, my friend.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.040]   Selfishly, that's the best part.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.520]   So I would say, if you're listening,
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.920]   if you like this or don't like it,
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.600]   I mean, genuinely, if you listen to this
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.440]   and you're like, this was not a good episode,
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.400]   please let me know.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.400]   I want to create content that you like.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.160]   Brad and I can have this conversation
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.680]   and not record it or record it.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.000]   We're going to have it anyways.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.440]   So let us know.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.120]   But if you do like it, send us topics
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.280]   that you think would be fun.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.520]   But if you have questions that might be better suited
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.160]   for a conversation than just a response, send them in.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.960]   And unless we get a bunch of bad feedback,
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.480]   we'll probably do this again, and we'll see where it goes.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.000]   Nice.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.400]   Yeah, sounds like a plan.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:53.880]   Awesome.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.200]   Very, very cool, Chris.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.160]   Always good to chat.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.040]   And yeah, until next time, please send in the feedback.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.400]   The cool thing is we could talk about anything.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.160]   That's what's fun about these conceptualized random shows
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.120]   is it can be anything.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:05.640]   All right.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.760]   Thanks for being here.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.640]   I look forward to the next one.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.200]   I hope you enjoyed episode 100.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.800]   And honestly, thank you so much for all the support
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.680]   the last two years.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.120]   I really don't know if I could have
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.960]   kept going if I didn't know all of you
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.400]   were here with me for the journey.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.040]   So I am excited for everything 2023
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.560]   will have in store for All The Hacks.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.560]   And I can't wait to share more of that with you.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:29.040]   Finally, one quick reminder to go check out Brad's podcast,
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.720]   Choose a Five, which is awesome.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.280]   If you have any feedback on the show, questions for me,
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.400]   or just want to say hi, I'm Chris at allthehacks.com.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.520]   That's it for this week.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.480]   See you next week.
