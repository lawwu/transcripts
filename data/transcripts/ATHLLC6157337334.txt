[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.560]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.780]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.320]   I cannot believe I'm saying this,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.760]   but welcome to episode 100.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.840]   It seems so surreal that I've come this far with the podcast
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.680]   but it really wouldn't be possible without your support.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.800]   So thank you so much for listening
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.680]   and supporting me on this journey.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.520]   Okay, as for this week's episode,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.480]   I wanted to try something a bit different.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.560]   And the idea came up as I was talking
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.920]   to my good friend, Brad Barrett,
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.160]   who hosts the ChooseFI podcast
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.520]   and was also my guest for episode two
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.280]   on financial independence.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.900]   We started having a conversation
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.160]   about me making it to episode 100,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.560]   him taking his show over on his own
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.000]   and all the things we've learned the past few months
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.560]   and how we're applying them to our lives this year.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.080]   Things like focusing on what matters the most,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.520]   optimizing our life towards net fulfillment,
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.060]   outsourcing tasks, and a lot more.
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.080]   But instead of having that whole conversation,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.360]   we paused and decided to record it
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.160]   and share it with you today.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.360]   It'll also be in the ChooseFI podcast feed next week.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.520]   So while you might not need to listen to it twice,
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.740]   you should definitely check out his show.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.000]   It is so fantastic and it touches on every aspect
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700]   of financial independence.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.200]   Okay, enough of the intro.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.700]   Let's get into the episode right after this.
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.280]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.600]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.780]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.800]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.240]   But one of his top hacks
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.720]   was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.160]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.880]   but after getting a full set
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.040]   of microwave cookware from Anyday,
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.800]   I am a total convert and I am so excited
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.040]   to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.080]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.360]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.700]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.720]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.360]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.280]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.440]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.640]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.280]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.460]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.760]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.080]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.160]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.280]   or use the code HACKS15 at checkout.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.280]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.720]   Brad, I am so excited we're doing this.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.560]   - Yeah, Chris, this should be fun.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.320]   We always have a lot of interesting conversations offline,
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.160]   so this should be a fun meandering little chat here.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.040]   - And I don't know if you knew this,
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.480]   so this is my episode 100, but I went back and looked
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.760]   and I know you weren't my episode one,
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.120]   but you were episode two on All The Hacks,
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.160]   and we actually recorded that first.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.760]   So my very first hit record on a podcast was with you,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.480]   so I'm very excited and thankful for you doing that,
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.640]   and it's fun to be celebrating 100 with you.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.560]   - Oh, that's so cool.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.640]   Well, I am honored that I was the first guest
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.640]   and back for 100 here.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.480]   Yeah, it's wild.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.360]   I can't believe you've been doing it that long,
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.400]   100 episodes.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.660]   - I love how Brad is saying this,
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.000]   because if you haven't listened to "Choose If I," his show,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.160]   Brad's probably done 600 episodes at this point.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.400]   I feel like I'm way, way, way behind,
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.120]   but when I started, I wasn't sure
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.400]   if it was gonna be 10 episodes
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.740]   and it just wasn't gonna be a good fit.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.000]   So the idea that I've gone from side project
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.200]   to full-time job on podcasting, I'm lucky to do that.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.920]   I'm so thankful for everyone listening
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.800]   that has enabled me to do that,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.000]   and I'm just excited for the next 100.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.320]   - Yeah, I hear ya.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.000]   What's wild about podcasting is there's no downside,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.280]   essentially, to trying it.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.080]   So yeah, we're coming up right on 600,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.640]   but when we started, it was just me and Jonathan
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.720]   sitting in a random spare office in Jonathan's house
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.920]   in Richmond, Virginia, talking into two microphones.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.160]   It cost us essentially nothing to start,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.480]   and we figured, what the hell?
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.000]   Let's experiment with this, and if it goes nowhere,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.840]   no harm, no foul, in essence, right?
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.400]   Like, nobody's ever gonna hear it other than our parents.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.460]   And if it goes somewhere,
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.620]   then who knows what kind of impact it could have.
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.560]   It's pretty wild.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.160]   Certainly, podcasting is something
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.080]   that I never would have guessed in a million years
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.200]   would transform my life.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.760]   I was a corporate accountant.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   I did corporate state tax returns,
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.960]   which is as horrible and mind-numbing as you can imagine,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   and now I'm a financial independence podcaster
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.080]   with 60 million downloads.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.000]   It's crazy, and then to see your life transform
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.180]   so dramatically since the first time I met you,
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.320]   which I guess was through
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.400]   the "Playing with Fire" documentary, right?
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.040]   - Yeah, I went to the FIRE,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.080]   well, I guess it's not technically a FIRE conference,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.280]   but FinCon seems like it's pretty rooted
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.520]   in the financial independence movement for my startup,
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.800]   'cause I was like, "Oh, we're building software
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.760]   "for financial planners and people
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.960]   "who wanna be better with finances.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.200]   "I should go to this conference."
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   We met, and it's been a great friendship.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.840]   And really kind of like how this episode came to be
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.400]   was we were just talking about things in life
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.840]   and catching up, and we're like, "We should record this."
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.880]   Like, people would probably wanna hear
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.000]   what we're thinking about, how last year went,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.840]   what we're planning to do next year,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.600]   what's going on with the FIRE movement,
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.100]   all the things, health and data breaches, everything.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.240]   So I'm excited to just jump in
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.440]   and go through what we go through,
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.320]   and if this does well, people like it,
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.520]   obviously reach out to Brad and I, let us know,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.320]   and we can make it a regular thing.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.400]   - Yeah, I would love to do this a couple times a year,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.240]   and that's for damn sure.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.000]   So yeah, let's kick it off.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.760]   The biggest thing in your world,
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.000]   I don't wanna put words in your mouth,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.560]   but you're full-time now on this podcast,
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.500]   and you left Wealthfront fairly recently, right?
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.280]   It's not an easy decision, no matter where you are in life.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.400]   I know, obviously, you have a degree of financial security
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.760]   that a lot of people don't necessarily
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.920]   when they're making job transitions,
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.540]   but nevertheless, that's not an easy step.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.920]   And I'm curious, how you thought through it.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.120]   - For me, I am always a fan of the side hustle
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.640]   to full-time hustle path.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.400]   I started the podcast as a thing on the side,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   I kind of experimented with working with partners,
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   and then got it to a point where it was, I guess,
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.080]   big enough, financially stable enough
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.800]   that it was worth the risk.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.920]   Is it financially stable enough
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.160]   that I would make as much money
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.680]   as if I had a corporate job right now?
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.040]   Probably not, but do I see a path there?
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.160]   And can I make it work?
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.000]   Yes.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.360]   And so that was really all I needed.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.300]   I still love Wealthfront, the product,
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.480]   I still love the team.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.760]   In fact, the one thing that is sad
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.960]   about being a full-time creator is it's kind of lonely.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.200]   You don't have that kind of water cooler team experience
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.040]   that you do at a company, and so I do miss that.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.600]   I still have a text thread
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.600]   with all of the Wealthfront people that I was close with.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.500]   We're talking almost every day,
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.320]   but I felt like it was an opportunity
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.440]   that if a friend asked me if they should take on,
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.880]   I was like, "Yes, you should."
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.520]   So I needed to do it myself.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.960]   I needed to kind of take my own advice.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.320]   And you, you had a co-host for a long time,
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.260]   and now you're kind of running the show.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.560]   Quite literally.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.520]   - Literally running the show.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.720]   Yeah, it's hard to believe.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.240]   Yeah, so Jonathan, I guess it was probably August
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.680]   of last year, yeah, we're coming five months and change.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.840]   He came to me and said,
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.760]   "I think I'm gonna step back from the podcast."
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.280]   And it was definitely a surprise.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.000]   And to everybody out there who,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.440]   'cause I got a ton of emails,
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.600]   I'm like, "Oh, what's going on?
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.720]   Is everything okay?"
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.640]   Everything's great.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.360]   Jonathan and I are still great friends.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.240]   In fact, I just came from a workout with him at the gym.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.200]   We're working out together four days a week now,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.600]   and he's doing stuff behind the scenes for Trues of Eyes.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.800]   So we're still business partners.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.640]   Everything's great.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.680]   He's gonna come back on the show every now and again.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.360]   But yeah, man, it's been interesting.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.720]   And you and I have talked a ton of times,
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.000]   talked shop actually, which is funny.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.320]   Though I've been a podcaster,
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.240]   I basically just have always showed up and recorded,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.080]   and that was it.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.680]   And Jonathan kind of took care of everything.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.000]   Yeah, when you're saying running the show,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.800]   it's been a big change for me, honestly.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.560]   And what I've always been good at in terms of the podcast
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.640]   was kind of like sitting back
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.040]   and just listening critically and asking questions.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.080]   And I mean, frankly, like for me and my skillset,
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.920]   that was pretty easy.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   It wasn't a heavy lift.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.960]   I just listened and asked her a couple of questions
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.400]   here and there, hopefully incisive, interesting questions.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.200]   But damn, now I've got to do Jonathan's part and mine,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.960]   which is Jonathan was always,
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.080]   hey, he was the engine behind the show.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.400]   The reason why I'm going into this,
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.040]   and I'm curious of like your process,
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.200]   is it is not just 2X the work for me.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.120]   Now, like being the engine behind the show,
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.880]   the story arc, and then the questions.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.320]   There's some like exponential factor,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.720]   especially with my brain.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.320]   Like when I get done with this, I'm fried, man.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.680]   I mean, normally like on an interview,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.840]   because you have to essentially bifurcate your brain of,
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.440]   okay, this side has to think about the story arc
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.040]   and moving it forward and making interesting and logical
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.680]   and coming to a conclusion.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.960]   But then the other side has to think of questions
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.960]   that are interesting and, oh, what would I want to ask
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.160]   if I were the podcast listener?
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.960]   'Cause that's how I think of myself.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.920]   And man, it is exponentially more difficult,
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.480]   but so far, I think it's going pretty well.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.240]   It's been 20 plus episodes now and so far so good.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.080]   It's been a challenge.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.920]   I'm not gonna lie.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.400]   It's been a challenge, but it's been good.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.720]   I think people that are listening think,
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.040]   oh yeah, podcasting, it's so great.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.360]   You just hop on, have a conversation,
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.920]   but there's a lot of work behind the scenes.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.280]   I spend a lot of time just trying to plan out
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.280]   what is the topics.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.880]   And somebody emailed me and said,
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.480]   hey, it'd be great if you could work with
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.200]   more sponsors I've never heard of,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   and you could interview people
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.720]   that have never been on other shows.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.320]   And it's like, yes, but finding those people,
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.960]   finding those companies to work with,
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.280]   it's definitely a full-time job.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.760]   I didn't want to start another startup
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.000]   'cause I didn't want to have another 80 hour a week job.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.920]   And my wife and I joke together, it's like,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.160]   oh, you did start a startup,
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.320]   you just didn't call it a startup.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.080]   So it's definitely demanding, but it's great.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.520]   You get a lot of flexibility and people listening
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.080]   probably know that I've been experimenting a lot with,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.920]   okay, well, what if I just do some solo episodes?
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.720]   What if I talk about a country?
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.520]   What if I do something different
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.200]   and don't necessarily stick to only the interview regime?
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.560]   But this is an example of that.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.480]   It's kind of an interview,
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.880]   but it's really more of conversation.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.520]   So that's been fun.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.920]   And then I've been trying to make sure
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.320]   that it's not my only thing.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.920]   We could talk about podcasting forever,
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.080]   but the average person listening here is probably like,
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.160]   oh, I don't have a podcast.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.480]   I appreciate the background.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.120]   It's interesting, but we are able to use the topic
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.840]   of the people we talk to and the content we consume
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.360]   as kind of research for the show
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.880]   as ways to think about other things in life.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.600]   That's also been a fun part of it,
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.560]   which is you do an episode with someone, talk about health,
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.440]   and now you got to go deep on your own health,
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.600]   and now that's a big project.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.960]   I know that's one of the things
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.960]   we're both really thinking about this year.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.120]   I thought maybe for this episode,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.440]   it'd be fun to talk about some of the major things
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.400]   that have happened in the last month or two
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.880]   that have sparked missions or goals
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.720]   for what we want to do this coming year
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.680]   and talk about it openly.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.240]   And hopefully people find that interesting.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.720]   When I hear you talk about your side,
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.640]   I'm like, yes, please tell me, taking notes,
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.320]   all that kind of good stuff.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.080]   - Yeah, and certainly right back at you.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.160]   I told you offline that a couple of your most recent episodes
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.000]   have really significantly impacted me.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.560]   No joke, I have listened to the Bill Perkins episode.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.720]   I think it came out in mid-December.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.440]   And Dan Martell with "Buy Back Your Time,"
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.480]   listened to each of those twice already.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.640]   It's fascinating.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.920]   I consume a lot of podcasts,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.280]   probably more than I should, frankly,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.760]   but you never know when an idea is just gonna hit you.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.160]   And if I'm honest with myself,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.200]   the Bill Perkins "Die With Zero" concept
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.920]   would not have resonated with me two years ago,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.520]   certainly five years ago.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.360]   It would have fallen on deaf ears completely.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.720]   I read his book, really good book, certainly,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.840]   but it didn't impact me as much
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.080]   as hearing him on your podcast.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.760]   And then I heard him on Peter Tia's "The Drive."
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.760]   And I think just the confluence of a couple of things,
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.480]   so like that, and I had my buddy Dominic Cortuccio
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.200]   on our podcast on "Choose a Buy" episode 419,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.640]   just a couple of weeks ago,
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.960]   and he was talking about your bold move for 2023.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.280]   So his conceptual framework is he comes up with like
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.360]   one bold move that kind of typifies that year.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.320]   And he's been doing this now for,
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.720]   I think this is the ninth or 10th year.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.240]   And it just sounded really cool to A,
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.920]   have like an operating principle behind a year,
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.200]   but also to be able to then look back
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.560]   on a decade of growth and fun and experience and say,
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.280]   oh, I was in that place when I did this bold move.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.160]   And the confluence of those three things have just like,
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.480]   without sounding hyperbolic,
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.800]   just fried my brain in the best possible way.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.640]   And I think for a while,
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.360]   and I'm probably a little like neurotic
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   and get inside my head.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.000]   I have like, you know, prone to anxiety and such.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.040]   It was actually a little stressful, Chris.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.520]   And when I spoke with Dominic,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.360]   I just didn't have an answer.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.920]   And then in hearing Perkins and Martel,
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   like it crystallized to me that I just need to explore more.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.000]   Like I need more fun in my life.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.760]   What I actually hit on was my healthiest year ever.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.840]   That's my kind of operating principle for 2023.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.960]   And what that means in practical terms
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.120]   is actually like loosening the purse strings.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.080]   I don't consider myself like a frugal
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.480]   or cheap person anymore.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.600]   Not that frugal and cheap are exactly synonymous,
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.280]   but obviously, you know very well,
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.520]   the old school five mindset of watching every penny.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.680]   I think both of us, frankly,
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.360]   have gotten a lot better with that.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.840]   So I'll let you jump in now,
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.280]   because I know that last thing is very impactful for you
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.120]   and how your mindset has changed
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.040]   just since I've met you, honestly.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.440]   - It's funny, when I first found
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.000]   the financial independence movement,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.920]   I was like, oh, this is great.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.220]   This is how I've been living my life,
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.280]   which is like save every dollar possible,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.000]   find every hack there is to spend less
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.160]   on everything you wanna do,
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.040]   whether it's house hacking or travel hacking or anything,
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.520]   so that I could save as much as possible.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.240]   My original goal was to do that
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.920]   because I hadn't found a career that I loved.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.760]   And I was like, I can't work a job I don't love.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.040]   So there was a real reason behind it.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.120]   But I feel like I went to an extreme
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.920]   that was very hard to get out of
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.400]   once I realized, oh, I actually do like what I do.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.480]   And now it was very hard to do the most silly things,
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.480]   like, oh, I'm at a restaurant
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.320]   and I really want a miso soup,
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.960]   but miso soup's usually $3 and this place it's $6.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.760]   And I'm like, ah, that just seems egregious.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.720]   I shouldn't get this miso.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.840]   It's like, all I want is a miso soup.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.600]   And we're talking about $3.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.360]   And I would get stressed out about it
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.360]   to the point that I wouldn't get the miso soup.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.600]   And my wife had ended up acting similarly.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.800]   So we would both be sitting there like,
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.720]   all we want is a miso soup,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.840]   but for $6 between the two of us, we can't do it.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.120]   But we could if it was $3.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.800]   It got to be a little crazy.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.000]   And I hadn't been able to articulate
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.800]   and process those feelings.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.640]   It's like something I'd been thinking about.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.240]   And I remember going to dinners where someone's like,
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.760]   we'll buy a really expensive bottle of wine
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.640]   if you just put in $20.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.880]   And I'm like, why would I put in $20?
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.840]   I'm only getting a glass
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.400]   and there's a glass on the menu for $12.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.080]   And they're like, come on, just spend eight more dollars.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.800]   Like everyone's just trying to get me
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.560]   to spend a little bit more.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.800]   And when I sat down with Bill Perkins and we talked,
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.960]   I was like, what is all of this money for?
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.360]   That was one big component.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.720]   And then the other big component
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.040]   that I probably haven't talked a lot about
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.040]   is that sometimes spending your money is not a net negative.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.800]   So for me, when I think about the podcast,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.000]   I'm like, oh, okay.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.400]   I've never been in a circumstance
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.800]   where the business you work at or run,
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.200]   the expenses you create for it directly affect your income.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.400]   When you work at a company,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.840]   if you spend a little bit more of the company's money,
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.240]   yes, there's like an indirect trickle down effect
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.960]   of the company being less profitable and might affect you.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.440]   But when you're owning your own business,
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.600]   if you spend all of the money the business makes,
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.960]   you don't have a salary.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.000]   It's very different.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.680]   So as I think about the year ahead,
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.440]   there are opportunities to build cool products
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.640]   that everyone listening right now might benefit from
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.680]   to save money on travel, to get cool deals,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.480]   like I have all these ideas,
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.680]   but to go spend the time and energy to do that,
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.120]   I either need to hire people or invest more time
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.840]   or get an assistant or something.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.120]   And I struggle with that,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.400]   even though I know that it's a good investment.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.840]   It's like, I'm gonna invest money in my own business.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.560]   So I'm trying to get better at it.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.160]   I don't have a bold move for the year,
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.240]   but if I did, it would be like value my time
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.120]   or invest in myself.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.640]   Maybe it's invest in myself, but I don't know.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.040]   I feel like that might be too broad
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.360]   'cause you'd be like, well, is it your health?
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.200]   Is it your time?
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.600]   And then you could just, it's hard.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.960]   And I think if there's anything I learned
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.240]   from running companies, you can't have a bunch of goals.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.360]   You need like a single theme that everything falls under.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.320]   Otherwise you just have this endless to-do list
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.240]   and you don't know how to prioritize.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.920]   - Yeah, I hear you.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.040]   And like you said, oh, I could build out this thing
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.600]   to help people with travel rewards
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.320]   and it may be a good investment,
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.280]   but I think one of the operating principles
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.520]   that I operate under is actually this question
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.600]   that I ask myself is, what are you optimizing for?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.040]   And I think it's just really impactful
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.280]   just to ask yourself that.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.200]   And like literally ask myself that quite often.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.440]   Like what in this situation are you optimizing for?
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.440]   From my daughter and what high school she's gonna go to
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.440]   is, okay, what are you optimizing for?
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.760]   Are you optimizing for signaling of,
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.920]   look how smart my kid is?
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.880]   Are you looking for, hey, this is a nice neighborhood school
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.220]   where she could be on the marching band
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.520]   and we don't have to drive her halfway across the county?
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.360]   Like, what are you actually optimizing for?
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.200]   Are you optimizing for elite college entrants?
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.600]   So that's something that's been rolling around in my head.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.000]   And the question to ask yourself is like,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.880]   really, what are you optimizing for?
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.520]   What would growth mean to you?
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.440]   Like in your case,
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.280]   and I'm not necessarily looking for an answer,
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.000]   it's mostly rhetorical, but is it money?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.600]   Is it impact?
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.520]   Is it building something new the world hasn't seen
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.420]   that like only Chris Hutchins
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.960]   and his inimitable style with hacks can put together?
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.360]   Like, is it some alchemy of all three of those things
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.680]   or something that I didn't listen?
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.120]   I think it's really important to ask that from the outset
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.960]   because you might get down a road where,
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.040]   hey, this is a good investment, this is gonna have impact,
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.680]   but damn, if it isn't gonna take up 40 hours a week
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.140]   out of my 168, is that worth it?
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.980]   - And I like to sleep,
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.920]   so 168 just isn't a real number in my mind, but no,
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.280]   it's a really valuable exercise.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.440]   I had Sahil Bloom on the podcast a week ago,
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.960]   and we just talked about doing that personal annual review.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.520]   And he has like, here are seven questions to ask yourself
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.040]   to reflect on the year past,
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   which I think is just a really valuable exercise
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.840]   to try to figure out, not necessarily just to reflect,
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.480]   but things like what created energy last year
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.120]   or what drained energy?
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.560]   How do you do less of that thing
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.200]   and do more of something else?
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.820]   If that's not something that anyone listening has done,
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.660]   I would encourage it 'cause it's really helpful
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.000]   before you start planning for this year
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.440]   to figure out what worked well, what didn't work well,
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.600]   what can you optimize for based on how last year went?
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.880]   And then you can start to focus on
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.560]   what do I wanna focus on now?
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.200]   You and I both kind of cut our teeth
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.880]   in the financial independence world,
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.640]   and I think most people think that we spend all of our time
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.760]   optimizing our money, when I think in reality,
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.280]   in terms of like our investments and our savings
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.600]   and our bank accounts,
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.560]   it's like one of the few things we spend almost no time on.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.960]   It's like this funny paradox
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.960]   of the people who care about their money the most
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.960]   and talk about it the most
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.920]   actually spend the least amount of time thinking about it.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.000]   And use it more as a tool.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.520]   So it was funny, Sam Parr posted this thing on Twitter
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.360]   where he's like,
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.200]   "Would you rather earn 8% guaranteed forever,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.320]   but at the expense of you can never invest in startups,
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.160]   you can never buy stocks."
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.840]   And so many people were like, "No, I wouldn't."
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.000]   And it's like, what?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.640]   So many people just really get caught up
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.200]   in that like eking for returns.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.800]   I don't know what your reaction was to that,
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.500]   but for me, this year,
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.920]   I'm not trying to turn the dials on my investments.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.560]   I'm trying to focus on my life.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.720]   - Yeah, focus on life is the critical part.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.440]   And it is this funny paradox that for people like us
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.060]   who have always been attuned to our money,
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.080]   really our financial lives are the easiest part
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.040]   of our entire lives because it's on autopilot, right?
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.320]   Like that's how I have my whole financial life set up.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.760]   I kind of famously say,
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.960]   I spend 10 minutes a month on my finances
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.240]   and that's maybe a little bit of an exaggeration.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.120]   It's probably ever so slightly more than that,
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.280]   but not that much more.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.400]   You set everything on autopay, autopilot.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.200]   For me, it's stress minimization.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.680]   So that's how I kind of conceptualize my finance.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.720]   I'm not looking to optimize every penny.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.460]   I'm looking to optimize for stress mitigation.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.680]   What that means in practice is I'll keep a little bit
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.720]   extra money sitting in my checking account,
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.920]   five or 10 grand, whatever it is, it doesn't even matter.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.080]   And then I don't have to worry about timing.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.320]   Like, oh, I have a big credit card bill this month.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.160]   Who cares?
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.980]   There's a big buffer there.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.760]   I never want to have to think about the timing of anything.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.200]   So all of my transfers happen pretty much on autopilot,
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.080]   except for a couple of random, you know, HSA.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.280]   I max out on January 1st of every year,
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   but I have a little task in Todoist,
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.600]   which is my task manager and it's just max out HSA.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.080]   And then I never have to think about it again.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.040]   But anyway, this thread from Sam was so interesting
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.560]   and it's especially fascinating.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.320]   So Sam Parr is one of the co-hosts
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.060]   of the My First Million podcast,
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.320]   which both you and I thoroughly enjoy.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.180]   And interestingly enough, Sean Puri is his co-host.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.300]   And he basically said, I asked Sean
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.620]   and a few others this question.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.420]   I'm shocked at how many said no,
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.820]   they'd prefer to buy individual stocks and other things
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.620]   in hopes of a return greater than 8%.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.900]   They want to manage their own money.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.280]   This baffles me.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.260]   And I actually wrote back to this,
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.580]   which Sean wrote back to,
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.420]   and I don't think was altogether thrilled,
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.500]   but I said, baffling and just silly.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.920]   Sean is a poker player, so he knows better.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.580]   The highest likelihood of success over an investing lifetime
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.000]   is to match the market with low fees.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.940]   Everybody thinks they're Warren Buffett.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.940]   They're not.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.700]   Match the market and get rich.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.580]   Find your fun in real life.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.760]   That last part was the point that I wanted to make
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.840]   is for most people,
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.860]   like a lot of these people on this thread
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.700]   were basically saying like, oh, but I learned so much.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.920]   I get fun out of this.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.860]   I mean, my argument is there's so many other ways
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.900]   to actually have fun in life.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.300]   And Sam's actual original post said,
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.060]   you can still build your own startups.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.780]   It's just, you can't invest in this wacky stuff.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.820]   And I think for me,
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.340]   I look at life through the lens of like a poker player
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.980]   and what increases my odds of success long-term.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.180]   So it's like the aggregation of marginal gains, right?
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.380]   1% differences might not make a difference
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.460]   in the short term, but over a lifetime,
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.100]   if you make the right decision over and over and over again,
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.060]   thousands of times, it's going to have an effect.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.100]   It's going to have a positive expected value,
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.980]   plain and simple.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.860]   If you put a gun to someone's head and say,
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.740]   are you going to outperform the market net of fees
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.860]   and net of taxes essentially from all your wacky trading
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.300]   over a 50 year time period?
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.020]   No, virtually nobody is going to outperform.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.980]   So you're willingly taking a lower net worth
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.180]   for no reason whatsoever, other than to have fun
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.740]   and to just be an idiot, essentially.
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.360]   And it makes no sense to me.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.620]   It's totally illogical.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.260]   I don't care how much money you have.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.900]   You can tell this gets me hot and bothered.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.760]   It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.420]   Go out and have fun in a million other ways.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.980]   But to me, money, it's about maximizing net worth,
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.660]   especially if you can do it the brain dead way
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.220]   by investing in index funds, right?
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.100]   Like if the easiest way possible to maximize your net worth
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.820]   is the no brainer way, man, that's a win-win
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.980]   in every possible way.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.340]   Why would you not pick that?
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.900]   - I'll play a slight devil's advocate,
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.720]   which is I thought you might.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.260]   - I'm not sure that picking stocks is the alternative
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.560]   that I'll put in this camp.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.780]   The question kind of carved out the ability
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.140]   to start your own companies.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.880]   But I do think that I've seen lots of people
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.140]   in my peer group and my friends that who've taken their
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.980]   money and built companies and taken their money
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.640]   and launched products that have generated returns
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.380]   that exceed what an index fund or a set of stocks would do.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.220]   So that's true.
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.580]   I do think there is some uncontrollable instinct
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.840]   that I love this thing, I want to bet on it.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.180]   It's like betting on yourself
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.380]   because you have this belief in the world.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.740]   And I like to do that with a small part of my portfolio,
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.460]   but it's so small that it doesn't matter.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.220]   And I would give it up if I had to.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.900]   The big thing I'll say is all of the investing advice.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.460]   If you asked this question three years ago
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.720]   before the pandemic, and you said stocks and bonds,
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.940]   how correlated are they?
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.260]   It's like, historically, they're always not correlated.
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.660]   The 60/40 portfolio is always going to do great.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.140]   That's why you diversify.
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.080]   And then it didn't.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.180]   And so I will say that as much as I don't believe
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.820]   what I'm about to say is something that you should factor in,
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.860]   I'll at least share it, which is that all of the knowledge
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.940]   we have about how much better index funds are than stocks,
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.780]   it's all based on what happened in the past.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.740]   And there are all kinds of things happening
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.240]   that could mean a different future.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.460]   That said, I don't think any of the people I know
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.540]   that are choosing to make all these active trades
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.740]   and active investments are doing it for that reason.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.180]   I think they're doing it for a different reason.
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.900]   I did this episode with Brian Feraldi,
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.900]   who has a whole checklist on how to be an investor
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.120]   and invest in stocks.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.260]   And he approaches stock investing
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.780]   much differently than most,
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.400]   building out a portfolio of stocks,
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.900]   almost like creating your own indexes
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.820]   and doing some kind of research and that kind of stuff.
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.660]   And I would say, if that's your approach,
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.000]   then I feel a lot better.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.060]   But if your approach is more, I just pick crazy things
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.140]   'cause I wanna win and I read about them on Reddit,
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:19.980]   I'm less excited.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.020]   But we can go down that rabbit hole forever.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.420]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day,
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.020]   and Viore is one of them.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.900]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.980]   for this episode.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.180]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.860]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.380]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.180]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.260]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.100]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.820]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.420]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.860]   And it's not just for men.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.260]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.900]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.340]   I think I have three pairs of them
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.860]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.900]   I've ever owned.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.700]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.780]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.700]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.860]   but they're also great for lounging,
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.100]   or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.060]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.380]   And for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.620]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.140]   If you're like me, it's about the time of year
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.780]   that you have to deal with collecting all your W2s,
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.960]   1099s, and any other docs you need
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.500]   for this year's tax return.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.220]   Well, thanks to Daffy, I never have to go digging
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.000]   through emails, desk drawers, or Dropbox folders
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.740]   to find my donation receipts,
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.860]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.720]   Daffy has a better system for giving
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.500]   and allows you to give to any 501(c)(3) across the US
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.020]   with just a few taps.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.860]   And because it houses all your charitable contributions,
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.980]   you only have one place to go at tax time,
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.360]   and you can easily make sure you're maximizing
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.180]   one of the most generous tax deductions in 2023,
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.860]   charitable contributions.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.980]   Daffy does all this by helping you set up
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.180]   a donor advised fund, or DAF,
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.180]   which is a tax advantaged account
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.580]   that lets you contribute cash or assets
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.780]   on a one-time or recurring basis,
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.980]   take the tax deduction at the time of the contribution,
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.240]   and then distribute that money
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.060]   to over one and a half million charities,
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.020]   schools, and faith-based organizations
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.420]   whenever you want to.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.540]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.300]   to get a better system for giving,
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.820]   and for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.100]   you can get a free $25 to give

[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.840]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/DAFFY.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.640]   I think both of us, almost all of our money
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.480]   is in some form of investment account.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.540]   I am curious, I think you manage yours on your own.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.200]   So you're doing the rebalancing,
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.820]   you're doing the tax loss harvesting.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.620]   I think, not because I did work at Wealthfront,
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.400]   but just because I believe that
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.140]   it is a better use of my time to not do that,
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.740]   and to get the extra edge from things like direct indexing
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.880]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.380]   Have you ever considered not managing it yourself?
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.300]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.900]   Under your advisement, I did open a Wealthfront account.
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.640]   I don't know if you ever actually even knew
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.520]   that I did that or not,
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.820]   but I have been putting some money in there.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.420]   So just more to kind of see
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.300]   how the tax loss harvesting worked, essentially.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.420]   And it's pretty cool, I'm not gonna lie.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.040]   There is no world where I would do that on my own.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.740]   I haven't done analysis, certainly,
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.040]   of like, is the benefit that I'm getting,
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.980]   does it outweigh the fees?
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.580]   I suspect that it does, but in all candor, I haven't.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.660]   I mean, sure, you have that information committed to memory,
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.800]   but in general, for me, if I were to not manage my money,
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.180]   I think it would be more psychological than anything.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.720]   I like to believe that I don't make poor decisions,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.240]   like sell when the world is going to hell in a hand basket
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.280]   in March of 2020, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.420]   But I think I'm as susceptible to that as anyone.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.960]   So I probably have underperformed
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.680]   what I should have performed
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.840]   if I just did what I advise all the time
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.240]   and just keep pumping money in, go to sleep,
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.520]   wake up in 10, 20, 30 years,
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.760]   and essentially have more money than I can imagine.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.080]   Obviously, nobody cried for me, I'm doing fine,
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.560]   I've reached financial independence.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.080]   At the end of the day, it's fine,
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.400]   but I know in my heart of hearts,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.200]   I've probably made suboptimal decisions based on emotion.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.700]   When we talked about, hey, like,
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.440]   the actual nuts and bolts of money is the easy part,
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.540]   I stand with that, and I hold to that, certainly,
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.240]   because I think it's precisely the psychological part
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.840]   that's really the hard part.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.360]   You let your brain get involved,
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.640]   and it just kind of does stupid crap.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.040]   - I've always noticed that the financial
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.480]   independence community, and myself included,
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.360]   always hate fees.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.560]   Like, it just is one of those things
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.160]   that people just hate paying fees.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.360]   And so I know that's been a lot of the aversion
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.920]   to an investment advisor, a financial advisor,
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.160]   a robo-advisor, any of those things.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.800]   And what really changed it for me one time was
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.080]   I had created this portfolio that was like eight index funds
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.200]   and I was going through trying the process of rebalancing
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.840]   and managing it and all that.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.920]   And I remember at one point I was like,
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.520]   what trades do I have to make?
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.680]   Well, I have to sell these three to rebalance.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.480]   And it was just like, I actually wasn't sure
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.360]   if I could make the trades.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.200]   And then I was like, well, I don't know if these trades
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.880]   are gonna have to clear before I can rebuy.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.840]   And so I just kept pausing, pausing, pausing,
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.480]   and I watched the market move and I was like,
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.320]   what am I doing?
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.800]   I don't think that doing this full-time is a priority
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.640]   enough that I'm doing it.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.040]   I have to offload it.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.960]   The added benefit was that things like direct indexing,
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.240]   when you can start to break apart the index fund
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.520]   and actually say, well, instead of investing
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.680]   in the S&P 500 or Vanguard, VTI, or VTSAX,
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.280]   you can just buy all the individual things.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.080]   Well, obviously that's completely untenable
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.160]   for a person to do and go buy hundreds and hundreds
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.360]   of stocks, but there's some advantages there
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.520]   when it comes to being able to tax loss harvest
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.160]   with a hundred or whatever number of stocks.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.880]   So we could go down here quite a bit.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.800]   I will attempt to pull back and stay on the money theme
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.000]   and just think, okay, so we're talking about money.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.960]   We've identified not focus on that side of money,
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.320]   but what are we focused on and how do we spend it?
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.660]   Are there things that you think next year
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.560]   you're gonna spend more time thinking on
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.480]   when it comes to money or how you spend it?
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.840]   - Yeah, without a doubt.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.960]   And your podcast has kind of helped inform a lot of this.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.200]   And I think for me, it's experiences and health.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.800]   So those are the two things that at this point
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.480]   I am prioritizing.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.320]   And I think what that's gonna mean in reality
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.880]   is spending money and that's perfectly okay.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.180]   And I think Brad circa five years ago
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.400]   would not have been okay with that.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.400]   And I am now, and I think that's perfectly fine.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.120]   And I'm frankly very happy about it.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.720]   - Are there any particular experiences
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.960]   that you're like this year, this is what I wanna spend on?
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.920]   - So you and I are both lovers of Japan
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.680]   and I desperately want to get back to Japan
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.580]   and I want to climb Mount Fuji.
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.280]   That is like an absolute goal of mine.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.280]   Will that happen in 2023?
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.120]   I don't know if it will or not.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.080]   So sophomore year of college over the summer,
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.160]   lived with a host family in a city called Hamamatsu.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.400]   And it was a couple hours South of Tokyo
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.040]   and the Shinkansen.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.960]   And the only time that I saw Mount Fuji
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.800]   was on the bullet train and it just appeared.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.860]   And obviously, you know how majestic it is.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.320]   It was the cloudy season.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.240]   And unfortunately, I only got like a couple
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.640]   little quick glimpses of it.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.960]   But I'm like, damn, I will be back there someday.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.360]   At this point, it's going on 20 plus years.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.040]   So I have not been so great with the follow through on that.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.680]   So my older daughter is now a roller coaster enthusiast,
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.920]   which is actually a thing.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.600]   Like that is an actual term, roller coaster enthusiast.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   There are like massive organizations
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.460]   of these roller coaster enthusiasts throughout the world.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.460]   And in the town immediately adjacent to Mount Fuji
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.040]   is one of Japan's best roller coasters.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.140]   So I'm using this as like my little hook
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.120]   to get my family there.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.460]   I'd be curious to hear your thoughts.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.280]   You now have two kids and I have two,
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.880]   I guess my kids are older at this point,
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.520]   which is kind of crazy to say,
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.080]   but it's still hard to travel.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.960]   And we have not been as good at that
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.240]   as I wish that we were, frankly.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.280]   So the very short answer to your question is,
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.520]   yeah, I need to get back to Japan.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.760]   I want to show my family, my wife, just that amazing culture.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.240]   That's the hope on like one of the big adventures.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.060]   - So if you're listening to this
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.200]   and you haven't been to Japan, you absolutely have to.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.960]   Next week, I have an episode
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.920]   that's entirely devoted to Japan.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.740]   - Seriously?
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.720]   - Yeah, I sat down with Brandon Presser,
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.280]   who is a previous guest,
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.800]   who I think said has been to Japan every year
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.760]   for the last 20 years, except one.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.000]   He's written, I don't know,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.880]   five or six guidebooks on Japan.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.800]   And we sat down, the episode's gonna be long.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   We might even split it into two next week
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   because we were talking for a couple hours.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.200]   The goal was to be a masterclass
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.560]   in planning a trip to Japan.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.320]   Overview of the culture, the people, the travel,
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.520]   the transit, Tokyo, Kyoto, other places to go,
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.400]   some hotspots that he loves, unknown little corner places.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.180]   So if Japan is anything you've ever even considered,
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.920]   you should listen, and I'm gonna try to fit in
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.600]   to this incredibly long episode at the end,
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   a little thing about how do you use your points and miles
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.180]   to get there, 'cause that's what I love.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.560]   How do you make it an affordable trip?
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.120]   Japan is known for being expensive,
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.400]   but so is San Francisco and New York and LA,
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.600]   and somehow we all find ways to get to those cities.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.040]   So yes, Japan should be on everyone's list.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.760]   I've been four times and it's still on my list.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.000]   But I'm gonna come back to your travel with kids thing,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.960]   and it's something I've been really thinking about.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.000]   And I actually had a really funny conversation this week
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.680]   with Tony Hawk, funny enough to bring it all together,
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.540]   about travel to Japan.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.120]   When he was in his early 20s, he had a kid,
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.880]   and for all we know of Tony Hawk being successful
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.800]   and famous and rich and all these things,
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.040]   at that point in time of his life,
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.240]   he was anything but that, like living on ramen, everything.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.480]   And he got these demo offers in Japan
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.840]   and he couldn't afford childcare,
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.400]   so he brought his kid to Japan when he was young.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.240]   And he would be like at a skate demo with a infant
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.560]   or toddler just like hanging out there
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.480]   because he just had to do it.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.720]   He didn't have any options.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.520]   But his advice was by doing that
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.160]   and being forced to do that,
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.600]   his kids just got so comfortable rolling with the punches.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.540]   So we took what I think was a very ambitious trip
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:22.960]   to Paris and London with a six month old and a two year old.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.720]   And it was nothing like a trip to London
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.700]   that you would take with no kids.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.040]   But we learned how to make it work.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.440]   Was it as fun as it was before?
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.280]   In many ways, no, but in a few ways, yes.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.960]   And maybe you could argue it too in six months,
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.280]   they're not quite old enough
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.560]   to necessarily appreciate the culture,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.120]   but they are learning how to sit on an airplane for 10 hours.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.800]   My daughter loves airplanes.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.680]   We invest in a lot of things that are painful.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.320]   If you wanna learn how to run,
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.760]   the first getting out the gate
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.000]   and starting to run as an adult is painful.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.520]   And then it gets easier and it gets easier.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.920]   I think the same thing is true with travel with kids.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.420]   And sure, I'm gonna do an episode in 2023
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.120]   about all the travel hacks I've learned traveling with kids
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.460]   from the Stoke-A-Jet Kids suitcase,
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.480]   which if you have a small kid is amazing.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.240]   It basically converts any coach seat
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.000]   into like a business class seat,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.920]   at least in the eyes of a young kid.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.400]   Does nothing for adults, by the way.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.120]   But I think you just have to do it.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.320]   The rule I heard from someone,
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.080]   just plan one thing a day, that's it.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.800]   Your itinerary is one thing a day,
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.080]   at least when they're really young.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.280]   Now that you're way past naps and early bedtimes
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   and the ability to not miss like five meal snack times a day,
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.160]   like you're past that.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.960]   So I think it's gonna be a little bit more enjoyable,
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.720]   but at the young ages, I just keep telling myself,
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.760]   I'm building up the travel resilience
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.760]   so that a few years when they really learn
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.720]   to appreciate things,
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.960]   we just have things so much more dialed in.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.160]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.000]   I like that.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.820]   And yeah, it's funny.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.720]   My kids at this point both go to sleep after me.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   So I'm like the old man that goes to sleep at 9.30.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.540]   I'm like fanatical about my bedtime.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.440]   So yes, I do not have to worry about nap time anymore
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.360]   or schedules, but nevertheless, you have to make the effort.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.160]   Going back to your question about experiences,
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.200]   I think it's about making the effort.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.520]   You talked about the loneliness
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.880]   of maybe not being in the office
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.800]   and not being around people all the time.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.480]   And frankly, working at home,
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.120]   regardless of whether we have conversations
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:12.960]   like this or not,
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.480]   and also being financially independent and being home
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.240]   and all of your friends are at work,
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.000]   you have to make an effort to actually see people.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.920]   And I think it's very, very easy to get into a rut.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.080]   And I think I have been in a rut for a while
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.480]   in terms of actually making the effort
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   to see people that I wanna see and do new things.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.680]   That's another thing, as you can tell,
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.800]   I'm a fanatical listener of all the hacks, right?
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.400]   Like one of the things you've talked about
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.120]   is like that one thing a month.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:48.960]   - Yeah.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.900]   - And that just always resonated with me.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.040]   I thought that was super cool
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.600]   the first time that I heard you talk about that
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.040]   and the operating principles.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.200]   Like, can I be looking for adventure?
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.960]   Do I have an answer to your question right now, Chris?
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:00.800]   I don't.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.160]   I could BS, like I'm gonna learn how to, I don't know,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.560]   do archery and drive race car.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.280]   I could BS anything you wanted right now,
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.320]   but it's not true because the only thing
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.080]   that I know for sure right now is like,
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:19.080]   my aperture is open to experience and fun and connection.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.040]   And like, those are the things
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.400]   that are like rolling around in my head of,
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.640]   hey, in conjunction with "Die With Zero" from Perkins,
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.560]   it's like, hey, you have some money, you have some time.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.320]   And you have people you haven't seen in a while.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.760]   Like, what would it look like to get together with people
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.600]   and to do something just cool and different?
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.560]   And that I normally wouldn't do
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.480]   because I frankly haven't done it for years.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.560]   So I think that's where I am right now.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.040]   So yeah, the next time we do this,
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.320]   hopefully I'll have an update for you.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.160]   I don't even know if I can be as adventurous
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.320]   as you with the one a month,
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.680]   but what if I tried five new things and just try to explore?
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.600]   So long story short is I'm gonna see how this rolls.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.480]   So I don't know, what do you think?
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.160]   You used to do one of these a month
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.440]   and obviously with COVID and the world shutting down
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.200]   and you having kids, how has that changed
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.440]   and how are you looking at it now?
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.840]   - I talked earlier about my goal for the year,
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.000]   my bold move is gonna be about valuing time.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.240]   So I think what that allows you to do
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.080]   is make time for whatever that thing is,
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.240]   whether it's something you wanna learn,
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.440]   whether it's something you wanna do.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.240]   I was talking to someone the other day
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.760]   and they were like, we're going on a trip without our kids.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.680]   Our parents are gonna watch.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.360]   And they had not done this and their youngest kid was five.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.040]   This is the first trip they're taking alone.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.040]   And it's a weekend trip.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.440]   It's not a crazy thing.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.400]   So I think you can make a lot of experiences
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.520]   that aren't the experiences of years past
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.440]   where it's like, let's take a two week backpacking trip.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.800]   Yeah, that's a great experience.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.280]   I just pulled off the bookshelf, Ben Nimpton,
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.520]   who I had on episode 36,
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.320]   who wrote this book called "The Bucket List Journal".
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.360]   And the reason I pulled it off
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.560]   is 'cause I'd encourage everyone to check this out.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.880]   We did an episode, you can get some of it there.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.160]   But he created this journal that is about a list
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.640]   that he created with some friends
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.580]   and it's an insane bucket list.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.720]   But he created a book to help people create their own.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.360]   But the thing he did that I think is so great,
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.700]   and I'm reading his do's or don'ts,
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.520]   it's like, do's, go on a date a month,
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.000]   like run five miles twice a week.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   He was kind of trying to give people ideas,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.460]   but he breaks everything into categories.
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.240]   And he breaks it into travel and adventure,
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.100]   physical health, material, creative, professional,
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.360]   intellectual, financial, mental health,
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.340]   relationships and giving.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.320]   So I wanna encourage people that when you hear us say
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.960]   experiences and things you wanna do,
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.960]   and you wanna think about how to be ambitious
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.200]   with your years ahead,
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.520]   don't assume that every experience needs to be like,
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.120]   jump out of an airplane,
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.800]   or like the traditional like big audacious experience thing.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.960]   One of the things that I have on my bucket list
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.540]   is to cook a seven course meal for friends.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.400]   Not necessarily go out to a fancy restaurant,
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.280]   just to make this incredible, awesome dinner
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.680]   where you think about it and you plan it
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.240]   and you shop and you do all this stuff.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.480]   Like that is an experience.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.600]   It's not jumping out of an airplane.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.880]   It's not traveling around the world.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.600]   I'm trying to prioritize things in other categories
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.280]   that I think are also really meaningful.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.800]   And so that's something I'm thinking about this year.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.640]   But when it comes to mine on valuing time,
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.920]   which I think is a big one for me,
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.680]   I wanna share some of the things I've done
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.640]   and some of the things I'm gonna do.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.980]   I think that one thing that's really unfortunate,
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.220]   I remember sharing an app to a friend of mine
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.840]   and saying, "Oh, this is a great app, Paprika."
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.000]   It's a food app, right?
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.800]   And it's recipe management, meal planning, all this stuff.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.920]   And they're like, "Oh, it's expensive.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.640]   It costs, I don't know, five, 10, $20."
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   So I was like, "Okay."
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.200]   We've kind of trained ourselves to assume,
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.440]   "Oh, software should all be free.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.960]   Content should all be free and all that stuff."
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.000]   Which is fair because it's not like we've been trained.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.680]   It's not like we just decided this.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.920]   And I have a similar problem.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.960]   I'm like, "Do I wanna buy an app for $20?
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.780]   This is crazy.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.140]   Most apps are free."
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.040]   But then I'm trying to equate things
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.400]   to how much is this gonna make my life easier?
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.400]   And of course, $20 is a good amount.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.600]   So there are a bunch of products
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.200]   that some of which I've partnered with, some I haven't,
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.360]   because I'm just such a big fan.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.720]   So Paprika is one.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.400]   It costs money and I love it.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.760]   It saves me so much time.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.720]   We meal plan on it.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.200]   We grocery shop on it.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.080]   I think it's great.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.880]   Partners of ours, Delete Me,
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.200]   is this site that I think is an incredible product
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.040]   that will basically go and remove all your data
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:02.880]   off the internet.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.220]   So I went pretty deep last year on cybersecurity
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.880]   and like, how do I get my data off?
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.320]   How do I make sure I'm protected?
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.640]   I did a whole two-part episode series
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.680]   where I interviewed someone
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.400]   and then did a ton of research and published it.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.400]   So you can go back and listen to those.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.080]   But that was one where I actually started
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.320]   and I was like, "You know what?
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.800]   I don't know if I wanna pay for a service
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.920]   that's gonna go delete all my information off the internet.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.360]   I could just go to every individual data broker website
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.200]   and do it.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.480]   Like, why would I pay for someone to do this for me?"
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.680]   And then I started doing it.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.740]   And one, I found that I spent five or 10 hours
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.580]   and I wasn't finished.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.680]   And I was like, "This is crazy.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.940]   I do not value my time."
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.600]   And then two, after I did it manually,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.440]   I was like, "You know what?
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.640]   Let's at least see if I got it all."
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.080]   And I didn't.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.960]   So like, I spent all these hours trying to do it.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.560]   And then I realized not only could I pay someone
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.400]   to save me time,
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.360]   but I could pay someone to do it better than me.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:52.760]   So that was an interesting one and a product I love.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.000]   I use 1Password.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.200]   They're not really a partner of the show.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.400]   I think there's an affiliate link for them if you sign up,
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.480]   but I think I make a dollar.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.400]   It's not like a big deal.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.700]   It's just like, because I already love it,
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.980]   I might as well put the link in on the website.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.120]   But just managing passwords,
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.120]   like I'm glad to pay for a service like that.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.000]   I'm glad to pay for photo storage.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.240]   We talked about money.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.880]   I love a product called Kubera, right?
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.160]   And it is a product that replaces
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.480]   your spreadsheet balance sheet, right?
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.800]   Like that's what it replaces.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.520]   And it syncs with all of the sites.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.800]   It's a premium service.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.760]   It's not free.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.800]   I think it's $150 a year,
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.840]   but they've worked with all the data aggregators
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.020]   so that they use the best,
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.000]   whether it's Platt or Yoda,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.280]   all these ways you sync your accounts,
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.840]   the best one for each account.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.840]   And they just built all the features I want.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.320]   And now I don't spend an hour a month
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.360]   updating my balance sheet spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.280]   And it's like, if I can save 12 hours a year
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.600]   plus get some extra insight,
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.480]   I would, of course,
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.480]   I should be willing to pay something for that.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:51.440]   And that's something I've gotten really in tune with.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.320]   And this year going forward, I'm like,
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.560]   maybe I need to try one of these
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.960]   virtual assistant services out.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.580]   I just signed up for Fancy Hands,
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.400]   which I'm not sure if it's gonna be the right fit
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.120]   'cause it's not really like a dedicated person
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.160]   that learns you,
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.580]   but I just wanna get myself comfortable with paying
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.220]   to save myself time
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.760]   because I'm using that time to be creative with my business,
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.880]   which hopefully will generate revenue in the future.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.800]   I'm using this time to spend with my kids,
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.960]   which I wanna do.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.680]   So that's been a really hard thing for me.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.480]   And I think one of the biggest unlocks
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.640]   was starting to pay for products and services
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.800]   that will save me time.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.840]   It starts out really easy when it's hour obvious,
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.620]   where it's like, I'm gonna have someone help clean my house,
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.700]   which I know would take me this many hours,
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.960]   but I'm trying to extend that to,
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.680]   I'm gonna use this software that's gonna save me time,
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.080]   or I'm gonna buy this product that costs more,
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.200]   but it's gonna save me time.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.080]   Are you good at that?
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.200]   - I'm getting better.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.040]   I'm trying.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.600]   And I share the same affliction that you share,
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.280]   which is, oh, of course I can do this on my own.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.040]   Or of course, if that's gonna cost a couple hundred dollars,
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.880]   I can do it just the same.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.000]   But like you said,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.400]   it almost invariably takes way longer than you anticipate.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.200]   And in the case of Delete Me,
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.700]   you don't do as good a job, right?
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.840]   I think I'm a work in progress on a lot of this stuff.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.560]   It's just reorienting,
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:13.280]   even down to meal planning and cooking meals at home.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.240]   So for years, we have, I guess,
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.920]   at choosethivy.com/meals,
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.320]   we have a PDF of like 30 recipes that she's curated.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.320]   They're not like her recipes.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.320]   They're recipes she's curated over the years.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.280]   Essentially, it was like $2 per person per meal.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.120]   And these are fabulous, delicious meals,
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.600]   like our A-plus meals, in essence.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.720]   And that's been fantastic.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.880]   And we meal plan, and we save time, we save money, et cetera.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.120]   But it's still a lot of hours.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.640]   And not to mention on the front side,
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.600]   but on the backside too,
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.720]   like you don't think about this, the cleanup, right?
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:50.080]   Like if you're cleaning up pans every single time
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.160]   and putting all the dishes away,
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.460]   it's like 20 plus minutes for each of us.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.800]   That's 40 person minutes, right?
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.200]   And then when you think about that times seven
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.200]   or times how many of our meals per week,
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.880]   it's just an absurd amount of time.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.320]   I think we've been much more cognizant of our time recently.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.560]   So we're actually spending significantly more
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.240]   on food recently.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.240]   And still in the cosmic scheme of things,
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.180]   it's not that much, Chris,
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:16.060]   but we're able to get delicious food
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.520]   from one of our favorite restaurants.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.880]   And it winds up being like $5 per person per meal.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.760]   And they cook it for you.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.460]   They have this like amazing, they call it like Sunday supper.
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:28.080]   And the way that it works is you can get enough food
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.340]   that for us, it lasts four dinners for the rest of the week.
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.420]   It's like $50.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.980]   It's absurdly cheap.
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:36.780]   - Brad doesn't live in the Bay Area for anyone listening.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:40.460]   Where dinner for four that doesn't last the whole week
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.720]   is like more than $50.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.340]   - (laughs) Yes, I am in a low cost of living area.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.460]   I'm in Richmond, VA.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.540]   But yeah, it's fun.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.880]   Like it's actually fun
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.340]   because there's a new menu every week.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.840]   We try something new.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.380]   My wife, this is the way that things have been delayed
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.660]   in our house 'cause she generally likes cooking.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.980]   She's always been the one who made the food
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.400]   and she's been doing that for a long time.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.940]   Especially when you have kids who we got into the bad habit
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.700]   of making different meals for people,
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:08.460]   which I don't advise at all.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.620]   And she's just kind of done with it.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.640]   It's a lot of fun, frankly, to like try new food every week.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.380]   And we don't have nearly as much,
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.720]   obviously on the front side, but on the backside also,
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.980]   they give you the pans to cook these things in.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:22.840]   There's no cleanup.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.520]   So it's just, well, damn,
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.640]   would I pay $3 extra a meal
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:30.640]   to not have to waste an hour of prep time and cleanup time?
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.560]   Of course I would.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.820]   100 times out of 100.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.440]   And the food frankly is as good or better
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.440]   and it's different every week.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.720]   We actually just recently hired someone
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.420]   to clean the house once a month.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:42.800]   And that's been great.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.180]   Just like little things.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.140]   I think I'm kind of dipping my toe in here.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.620]   I'm not maybe quite as advanced as you at this point
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:51.820]   in terms of like the virtual assistants and things like that.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.140]   I'm open to it.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.340]   I think it's just more like,
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.420]   I need to conceptualize,
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.040]   like what does that actually look like?
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.100]   How are you thinking about that?
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.580]   - Well, I did this episode with Dan Martell
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.100]   that you already referenced about buying back your time.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.980]   And I consider Dan, having talked to him,
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.100]   to be like the pro.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.660]   I'm like, you don't spend one second of your day
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.960]   on something that isn't a good use of your time.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.400]   And I'm not sure I have the roadmap
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.920]   on how to exactly get there.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.200]   And some of the things he's doing require more capital
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.720]   than I'm willing to spend on it, but I'm working on it.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.920]   We experimented with hiring someone to drop off meals
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.280]   and do the preparation.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.520]   We're trying to go out or do carry out a couple nights a week
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.800]   just to give ourselves a break.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.600]   We built bulk cook so that we have enough meals
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.520]   for another day.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.220]   I hope to have an update in the next time we chat,
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.800]   which is some of the experiments and the results of them.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.860]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.600]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.420]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.040]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.560]   without our consent.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:52.520]   I found a listing for my dad on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.480]   that had his name, age, address, phone number, email,
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.320]   past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:03.880]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:07.140]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours finding all the sites
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:10.000]   with his info and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.240]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Avine,
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.560]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.520]   for this episode.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.480]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.580]   and remove your personal information
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.360]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.480]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.120]   and get that removed as well.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.320]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes over 2,000 pieces
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.920]   of data for a customer in their first two years,
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.820]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.740]   for their customers.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.300]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.300]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:49.300]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme and get 20% off a plan
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.860]   for you or your entire family.

[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.900]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.300]   With over 2,500 classes from a range
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.160]   of world-class instructors like Steph Curry,
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.380]   Richard Branson, and Martin Scorsese,
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.380]   that thing you've always wanted to do
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.340]   is way closer than you think.
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:19.780]   When I signed up a few years ago,
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.340]   I jumped straight into an amazing cooking class
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.180]   by Thomas Keller that has totally leveled up my skills
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.120]   in the kitchen.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.900]   I also really enjoyed FBI hostage negotiator,
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.700]   Chris Voss's class on the art of negotiation.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.380]   And with every class I've taken,
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.340]   I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.540]   the instructors have and the quality of the experience.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.100]   And a Masterclass membership makes such a good gift

[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.540]   are there any other money things
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.420]   you're thinking about going forward?
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.440]   - I am kind of at a crossroads
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.620]   with my real estate investing.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.100]   So I know a bunch of our listeners
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.740]   have asked for an update with this is,
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:31.740]   I went to buying,
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.120]   and I don't know if I ever told you this,
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.200]   but two single-family rental properties
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.720]   down in Georgia a couple years ago.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.000]   It's probably three or four years ago at this point.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.440]   And I've never liked real estate.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.280]   Kind of scares me.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.720]   I had a bad experience of like kind of speculation
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.420]   back in my 20s, and it just scarred me for life.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.000]   I've gotten over it to a large degree
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.920]   in terms of like, okay, idiot,
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:54.560]   don't look at this as like,
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.800]   you're gonna make a quick buck,
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.620]   this is gonna go up.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.980]   Like, look at it as a business.
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:58.820]   I'm a CPA.
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:00.800]   I should be looking at this as a business.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.980]   And does it have cashflow?
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.280]   Is there positive net income?
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.800]   And what's the return on investment?
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.160]   So I actually bought both these properties in cash,
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.700]   and they've been great.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.700]   They've returned phenomenally.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.380]   Like the bigger pockets, 1% rule.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.180]   Now, obviously for anybody in the Bay Area,
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.420]   or like this is for your own personal residence,
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.700]   this is laughable.
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.100]   But for an investment property in rural Georgia,
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.460]   or in Alabama, or in many places throughout the country,
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.920]   you can find it's like 1% of the purchase price
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.720]   as the monthly rent.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.040]   So now for instance, I bought these properties
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.880]   after renovation, I bought them for basically $55,000 a piece.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.380]   So 1% of that would be $550 a month.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:47.920]   So that would be then like a 12% gross return per year.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.760]   But actually, Chris, I rent them for like 750 and 800 a month.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:55.200]   So it's like 1.5%, which is phenomenal.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.880]   And so far, and it's a small sample size, obviously,
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:01.240]   but I haven't been hit with any major extraordinary expenses.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.200]   Obviously, there's always stuff that comes up
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.160]   as a homeowner or a landlord, but they've returned
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.100]   phenomenally.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:10.400]   And then that brings the question, OK, yeah,
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.040]   I kind of don't love real estate,
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:16.220]   but these have been like an unmitigated success.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.920]   And then I had Alan Corey on the podcast a couple of weeks
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.920]   ago talking about, hey, maybe that sounds great,
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.520]   but what would that have looked like if you had bought eight
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:31.440]   of these with 25% down instead of two with 100% cash,
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.000]   in essence?
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.760]   Those index funds, they're so easy.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.720]   There's no overhead.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.960]   Oh, index funds are so easy.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.960]   And that's the constant tension in my life,
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.600]   is I just want simplicity.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.920]   Simplicity is everything to me.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.920]   But the diversification--
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.840]   Chasing those returns.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.800]   Yeah, those returns.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.000]   That's what it comes down to.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   You can know intellectually, but damn,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.360]   those returns are great, right?
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.200]   And is that a small sample size?
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.640]   Is this replicable?
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.640]   Am I going to not sleep as well at night
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.640]   if I have a mortgage on something?
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.880]   So these are all kind of rolling around in my head.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.880]   What are your time-adjusted returns?
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.360]   Because I promise you that buying that rental property
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.960]   and managing that rental property
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.200]   has a cost of time that is greater than how long it
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.460]   took you to buy VTI or VTSX or whatever index fund.
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:21.480]   And I don't know if there's an easy way to factor that in,
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.680]   but I don't know.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:25.160]   For me, the only real estate that we
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.960]   have other than our primary residence
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.720]   is a fractional home that we stay in.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.480]   And that's it.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.000]   We're not trying to rent it out.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.280]   We're not trying to make money.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.600]   It's just a good way for us to be able to have
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.800]   another place to go to.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.100]   I've always struggled with this.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.720]   I did this episode with Brandon Turner,
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:44.220]   and he has a real estate empire and has amassed a net worth far
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.680]   greater than both of us combined through real estate.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.600]   But every time I think about it, I'm just like,
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.260]   I don't know if I want to play the game.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.260]   It doesn't excite me.
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.760]   Being a landlord is not fun for me in any scalable thing.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.640]   I just published a newsletter as we're recording this today,
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.960]   but last week, about house hacking.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.840]   Love that concept.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.340]   Like, if we could build an ADU in our house, it'd be awesome.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.240]   Being a one-off landlord and taking on that kind of little
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.640]   work is not too much.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.120]   But actually, like, turning it into a profession
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.880]   and doing it, it's for a lot of people.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:13.960]   And I think a lot of people do really well with it.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.420]   My brother and sister-in-law, like,
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.120]   they've bought up a bunch of auto repair and tire shops.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.500]   It's like, there are a lot of businesses that you can own
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.340]   and they can be very successful and you could do well with them.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.380]   That's just not what I want to do.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:25.580]   But they've done a great job.
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:28.220]   And it's funny how real estate seems
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:31.920]   like the obvious alternative of what to do with your money.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.660]   But then you listen to someone like Cody Sanchez, who's
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.800]   going to be coming on the podcast soon,
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.420]   and she's like, I'm buying laundromats.
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.720]   I'm buying all these businesses.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:42.580]   There's lots of ways you can buy businesses, one of which
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:43.900]   is a rental property.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.940]   But do you want to do that professionally or not?
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.220]   And what is the opportunity cost?
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.740]   If you put a little bit more of time instead of into that,
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.300]   into your side hustle, or to your day job,
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.340]   or to the company you run, or something,
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.260]   will that be as lucrative in the long run?
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.840]   It's hard to compare because there's
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.440]   no average return on investment of spending time
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:04.600]   on your side hustle.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.220]   But I encourage people to realize
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:10.420]   that real estate has a time component that, if you don't
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.660]   love, can feel like a lot of work.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.860]   And I think a lot of the real estate people who
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.780]   pontificate about how wonderful it is,
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:21.500]   I think there's a large degree of survivorship bias to it.
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.740]   Frankly, you don't hear about all the people that
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:26.740]   got wrecked by leverage and just made stupid decisions.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.140]   I think there's some aspect of that, certainly.
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.340]   And no matter how I run the numbers,
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:33.300]   even without factoring in leverage--
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.340]   because any time you factor in leverage,
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:38.020]   there's always that risk of this going kaboom.
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.700]   Let's be perfectly honest with ourselves.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.580]   But without leverage, even that 1% rule,
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.940]   there are very few people, very few markets in the country
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:48.060]   that can find that 1% rule.
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:50.620]   Again, 1% of the purchase price per month in rent.
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.380]   Yeah, you're not going to find it here.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:52.880]   Right?
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.020]   Not in a million years.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.980]   In the Bay Area, that's for damn sure.
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.540]   And that's a 12% gross return.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.260]   And then, again, bigger pockets--
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.740]   you mentioned Brandon Turner--
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:07.660]   they say you should anticipate about 50% of the gross rent
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.460]   as expenses.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:15.580]   So OK, your 12% gross return turns into a 6% net return.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.780]   6%.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:17.980]   That's not so fantastic.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.860]   And then, obviously, there's appreciation.
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.740]   But appreciation, in my opinion, is speculation.
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:25.180]   You cannot bank on appreciation by any means.
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:26.420]   So it's speculative.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:29.860]   But that said, you can anticipate a couple percent
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.540]   appreciation.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.940]   So we're still back at 7%, 8%, 9%,
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:38.020]   which is pretty analogous to what we anticipate in the stock
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:38.540]   market.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.660]   And like you said, it's a whole hell of a lot easier
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:46.420]   to buy VTI or VTSAX than it is to run a real estate rental
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:47.940]   company, if you will, or whatever you
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.100]   want to conceptualize it as.
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.460]   So is the juice worth the squeeze?
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.140]   I think if you like it, great.
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:58.900]   If you enjoy that, like I enjoy optimizing my travel, great.
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.380]   I think it's awesome.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.100]   But just don't go into it thinking it's
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.580]   the best thing in the world.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.220]   Teach his own.
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:04.900]   Teach his own.
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:06.180]   There are people that love it.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:08.980]   But without leverage being included,
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.500]   because leverage can go both ways,
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.540]   it's no better than essentially anything else.
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.340]   And obviously, again, the real estate people
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:19.460]   will pontificate about the tax benefits and the 1031
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:20.220]   and all this stuff.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:21.620]   There is that to some degree.
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:23.900]   But like you said, you've got to factor in your time
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.460]   a little bit.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.860]   I think that's important.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.660]   So the only other money thing I had
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:30.300]   was that we have an au pair from Italy.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.180]   She's amazing.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.460]   Our last few au pairs didn't drive, but she does.
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.060]   And we're adding her to our insurance.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.980]   And when you add someone who hasn't ever
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.420]   had a license in the US who's under 25,
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.540]   your insurance goes up.
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:43.900]   And so that inspired me to start going to reprice my insurance.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.980]   And I'm going to do an episode all about insurance,
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:47.740]   so keep an ear out for it.
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.260]   But I would just say it's amazing
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.020]   that every few years, different insurance companies completely
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:56.500]   change the way they price different things.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.020]   And I've consistently in my life found
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:01.300]   that every couple of years, I just send all--
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.140]   I keep it in a nice, easy formatted thing
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:04.980]   where I'm like, here's the level of coverage we need.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.580]   Here's all the things we need to cover.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:10.140]   And I'll just send it to a few insurance reps or brokers
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:12.700]   and be like, hey, could you give me some quotes for this?
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.820]   Because for some reason in California now,
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.500]   most of the websites don't let you price yourself anymore.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:18.620]   This is just my experience.
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:20.580]   I went to State Farm, couldn't price it myself.
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.920]   So I had to email it to someone.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.980]   But I did that.
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:24.500]   And sure enough, I think I'm going
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.460]   to save $600, $700 a year on insurance.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.580]   Might even be closer to $1,000 just
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:31.180]   by shopping around and repricing.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:33.820]   So that's my little fun thing for 2023
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:36.820]   is if you haven't repriced your insurance in a little while,
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:38.940]   especially if you've got your home or your rental,
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.300]   you've got your car, maybe you've
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.140]   got an umbrella policy, you start to add all the things up,
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:45.540]   could be worth shopping around and getting a deal.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:49.540]   Yeah, I think there are a lot of these little one time a year
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:52.180]   things that you should do that a lot of us don't do, frankly.
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.420]   But at least to be mindful of it, like I said,
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.780]   throw it in some task list that you have come up
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:57.780]   in mid-January.
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.580]   And you could do it more often.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.420]   But frankly, is the juice worth the squeeze?
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:04.540]   So I think one time a year, price insurance.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:07.020]   One time a year, hopefully at minimum,
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.420]   but certainly one time a year, go through your credit card
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.900]   bill, just line by line.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.860]   Are there any recurring things that you just forgot about?
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:17.100]   This happened to me a couple of times with random Peacock
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.020]   or Hulu or some kind of Paramount Plus or some such.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.500]   And like, oh, I wanted to watch Top Gun Maverick,
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.620]   so I got Paramount Plus.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.460]   And I'm probably going to be paying
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.500]   for that for a couple of months because I'm stupid
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.740]   and I didn't cancel it.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.900]   Just use Rocket.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.100]   Look, they're a partner of the show.
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.500]   They're not paying me to say this,
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.020]   but Rocket Money is so good at this.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.020]   Zuta.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.020]   Free app.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.540]   You sync your cards, and then they
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.140]   scan for things that are recurring.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:42.940]   And then they just give you an easy view
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.140]   of here are your recurring subscriptions.
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:44.700]   That's cool.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.500]   Now, their business model is, OK,
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.180]   is there a recurring subscription?
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.220]   You can go cancel it.
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.780]   Or you could just tap one button,
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.220]   be like, go cancel it for me.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.420]   And you need their premium subscription to do that.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.900]   But then they'll go reach out to whatever company is
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:59.100]   and just cancel it for you.
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.740]   And depending on the state you live in, in California,
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.020]   companies are required to let you opt out online.
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.740]   But if you have a New York Times subscription
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.660]   and you don't live in California,
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.620]   it's so hard to cancel.
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.020]   By the way, if you don't live in California
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.260]   and you have things to cancel, next time you're in California,
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.380]   just go online and do that.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:15.380]   Or if you have a VPN that has a California option,
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.980]   it's really easy to cancel online here.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.740]   That's very cool.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.300]   Now, it's certainly very timely, as I'm
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.460]   talking about doing it manually.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.500]   We're talking about saving time.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.140]   Saving time.
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:22.820]   Saving time.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:23.740]   That's the whole game.
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.300]   But when you do reprice your insurance,
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.340]   make sure you actually look at how many miles you
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.180]   drive on your car.
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.820]   So we don't drive that much.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:33.020]   And so one of our car policies is priced at 5,000 miles
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.380]   a year, one's at 3,000.
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.220]   But if you don't tell your insurance company,
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.340]   they price it at like 10,000 or 12,000 a year.
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.660]   And you can actually save a ton of money
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:40.820]   if you don't use your car a lot.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.980]   I think a lot of us now that we're working from home more
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:44.940]   might not be driving as much as you used to.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.980]   So you might be overpaying for insurance,
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.620]   even without switching carriers, just
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.300]   because you didn't tell them that you're
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.860]   using less than whatever they set as your average mileage.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:54.780]   That's a cool tip.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:55.420]   I like that.
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.580]   I mean, that's easy, right?
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.340]   Like, hey, just a quick email, quick phone call.
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.100]   That's cool.
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:03.300]   I think we're describing like, how do you do simple things
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.300]   that it's just not going to take a ton of time?
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.840]   And you've heard me reference to do it a bunch of times here.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.500]   But I want to offload everything out of my brain, everything.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.180]   So I have all of these recurring tasks.
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:17.060]   And I don't think that's the best answer.
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.260]   Knowing you, you have some better answer than Todoist.
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:20.600]   I don't doubt it for one second.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:27.960]   But for me, it's like, OK, if I am 100% essentially adamant
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.560]   about putting everything in my life into Todoist,
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.160]   then I don't have to think about it ever again.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.640]   So if a task comes up, even down to-- like,
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.280]   I just renewed global entry.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.700]   And literally, the next time I have to renew is 2027.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:45.320]   So I just quite literally put the task in.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:50.640]   It comes due July of 2027 for February 2027.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.360]   And now I never have to think about that ever again.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.640]   Because I know when 2027 rolls around February,
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.600]   I'm going to see that.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.600]   And I have the URL for where I need to renew.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.480]   And it's just there.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.960]   The psychological baggage of getting all of this nonsense
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.880]   out of your head, when you free that,
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.480]   it's like the most freeing feeling you'll ever experience.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.880]   Think about all of those things that
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.880]   are rattling around in most people's heads of,
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.200]   oh, I have to do this next week.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.440]   And I have to make that phone call two weeks from now,
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.480]   whatever.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.600]   You don't have to do that.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.320]   Just get it out of your head.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.000]   Put it, in this case, on digital paper.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.720]   And your life is so much better.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.200]   So that is probably the thing that
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.840]   has improved my life most significantly
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.400]   in the last couple of years.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.200]   But again, like I said, you have to be 100% compliant with it.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.120]   Because if you're not, then you'll always
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.120]   have that nagging doubt that, oh, is it really in there?
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.720]   Can I really trust this?
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.800]   But when you can trust it 100%, you're golden.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.720]   So I don't know.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.360]   Do you use anything like that?
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.400]   I do not have a good system like that.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.320]   I do use this app called Trustworthy,
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.040]   which I'll call the family operating system, where
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.600]   you can basically store all of your IDs,
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.720]   your vaccination cards, your passports, your tax returns.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.800]   It's like a secure, organized repository.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.000]   You could have a Dropbox folder and put all this there.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.640]   But it's not as organized.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.600]   This has an app.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.560]   So when I'm at the doctor's office,
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.520]   and they're like, can we reconfirm
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.360]   your daughter's insurance?
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:11.880]   I'm like, yes.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.240]   I know where her insurance card is.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.120]   You get in a car accident, where's your car insurance?
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.320]   I know exactly where that is.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.120]   And then on top of that, I like it
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.560]   because you can nominate a person, which for us
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.200]   is like my sister-in-law and my wife.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.280]   It's like, if something were to happen to you,
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.600]   let these people, through some verification,
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.360]   have access to all of our stuff.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.640]   So we just store all of our stuff there.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.240]   And it actually has a feature like this.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.240]   You upload your passport or your driver's license,
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.840]   and you put in the expiration date.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.200]   And then they remind you, hey, your driver's license
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.320]   expires in six months.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.320]   So it's a little bit different in that it's not
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.640]   a control repository.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.240]   But for a lot of those kind of expiring things,
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.360]   I have that in there.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.280]   But I have not found a task management solution that I love.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.240]   I got to work on that.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.280]   But we are well on our way to filling an episode.
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.640]   And we had a whole topic of health.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.880]   Do we want to jump into that?
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.520]   Do we want to do that again the next time?
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.240]   What do you think?
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.320]   Maybe we give a quick overview because I suspect
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.360]   with a lot of this stuff, we're at the beginning of the year
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:06.860]   here.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:08.120]   We're both exploring.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.640]   And I think what could be cool is
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.000]   for there to be some accountability to the audience
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.080]   of, hey, we're going to actually follow through on this.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.640]   Because I think that's what we tell our audience all the time
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.080]   is it's great to take in information,
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.000]   and that's all well and good.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.480]   But if you don't take action, it's all worthless.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.040]   So you have to get up off the couch and take action.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.440]   Also, frankly, I fall down on this a lot.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.600]   There are probably dozens of things
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.320]   that I've promised over the years that I--
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   oh, I'm going to do this.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.700]   And I don't follow up because there's no accountability.
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.320]   So it would be pretty cool maybe on some level
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.040]   for us to be accountability partners,
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.000]   and then by extension, the audience to some degree.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.500]   I don't have a prepared list of things
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.160]   I want you and the audience to hold me accountable for when
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.500]   it comes to some of these things.
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.520]   I know you have a few on health.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.720]   Why don't we set the stage for this at a high level
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.680]   and say, look, health is a big thing for us.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.380]   We want to spend some time focused on it.
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.320]   So one, if this is interesting as an episode,
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.600]   definitely reach out to Brad.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.920]   If you're listening to all the hacks, reach out to me.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.200]   If you're listening to-- or reach out to both of us.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:06.760]   It doesn't matter.
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.120]   But let us know so we know.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:08.840]   Should we keep this up?
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.720]   Should we keep doing this?
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.000]   You don't have to send a long email.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.960]   You can send Chris at all the hacks and say, do Brad again.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.760]   I'd rather get the feedback than get this really nice response.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.000]   Whether it's on social or email or whatever format you like,
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.880]   I'd love to know what people think of this
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.160]   so we can come back and finish this whole health thing.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:25.920]   What do you think?
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.800]   That's a great idea.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.320]   Same for either your audience or mine.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.920]   Go to chooseavi.com or just get on my newsletter
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.200]   at chooseavi.com/subscribe.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.160]   When you hit reply, it literally comes to me.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.360]   So I'm the one who'll be reading all those emails.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.200]   So let us know what you think about this.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.400]   We kind of conceptualize this as, like you said,
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.280]   a conversation, just kind of a random show of, hey,
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.520]   what's going on in our lives?
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.960]   And I think just to set the stage for this,
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:52.480]   certainly for next time, is, yeah, I think my bold move,
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.280]   as I talked about with that episode with Dominic Cortuccio,
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.440]   is I want this to be my healthiest year ever.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.840]   I don't precisely know today how I can quantify that.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.840]   But I'm not letting that limit me.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.360]   With my kind of over-anxiety analytical brain,
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.440]   I would have let that be the limiting factor
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.960]   and not gotten started.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.920]   But I'm going in with an open mind of, hey,
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.880]   I want to experiment.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.840]   So just a couple of things that I've
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:21.400]   been doing so far which I think have made a big difference.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.440]   First, Chris, you know more than anybody,
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.560]   I am a massive fanboy of Dr. Peter Attia.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.120]   I've been following him since, I think,
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.640]   episode 50 of The Tim Ferriss Show, which came out maybe
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.800]   nine years ago, plus or minus, which is crazy.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.600]   He's a pretty high-performing athlete throughout his life.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.120]   And a couple of years back, he decided
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.880]   to what seemed like basically stop a lot of his heavy training
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.160]   in favor of this program called DNS.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.440]   So it's Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.560]   And it sounded fascinating to me because I kind of
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.560]   been plagued with some shoulder issues and neck issues.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:01.240]   And everything that I tried was always a band-aid.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:05.360]   There was no actual substantive fix to it.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.040]   And the more I learned about DNS,
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.480]   the more that I thought this could be the answer.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.680]   There aren't that many DNS practitioners in the US.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.680]   But luckily, there's one here in Richmond.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.440]   And I've been going to him for the last month or two
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.240]   at this point.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.360]   And Chris, I kid you not, it has been the best thing
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.040]   that I've ever done for my body.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.480]   I feel so much better because it actually
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.120]   looks at the brain and nervous system
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.560]   as almost going back to developmental milestones
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.120]   from when we were infants.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.200]   And if you missed a milestone, it's
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.360]   not like you were incapacitated for the rest of your life.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.280]   Obviously, I've been a fairly normal person.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.640]   But you always are coming up with some workaround.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.360]   And what that leads to in a lot of cases
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.680]   is injury and/or stress in certain spots.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.880]   So very long story short, because again, we'll
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.960]   talk about this more in depth, is
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.920]   my neck and my hip flexors, which are constantly tight,
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:02.920]   have never felt better.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.920]   I wake up in the morning, and I'm like, holy cow,
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.840]   I can move my hips in a way that I didn't think was possible.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.480]   Like, I didn't think it was possible
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.800]   that I could feel this good.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.040]   And that's just from a handful of times
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.400]   going to this DNS doctor.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.720]   And again, with the experimenting and not
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.800]   worrying about money and just trying to explore this,
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.800]   it's fairly expensive.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.120]   That's not covered by insurance.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.560]   So I'm paying out of pocket every single time I go.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.120]   But it's working.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.480]   And I would be foolish, in my opinion, to not do it
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.840]   and to not continue just over dollars, which,
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.920]   as Perkins would say, when you wake up and you're 85
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.080]   and you have more money than you could ever use,
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.520]   are you going to look back on whatever?
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.160]   And now he would talk about experiences and memory dividends
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.040]   and all these things.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.080]   But in my case, I might get extra years of vitality
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.760]   out of spending this money.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.400]   So to me, it's an absolute no-brainer.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.920]   The other thing is morning walks.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.560]   I also listen to the Huberman Lab podcast a ton.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.200]   So he's always talking about getting morning sunlight.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.680]   Easiest way to do that is just going to walk.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.320]   And it's just wonderful to be out in nature,
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.280]   peaceful in the morning.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.320]   Nobody's around.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.720]   You get some morning sunlight.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.600]   It's just been like these add-on effects.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.120]   The third and biggest thing, though this is the newest,
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.660]   so I don't have all that much to it,
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:18.040]   is I hired an online fitness coach who
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.880]   I found through Twitter that I believed
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.880]   in what he was espousing.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.080]   And he wound up having this program.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.920]   And now, like I said before, I'm going
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.960]   in to the gym with Jonathan, my Choose a Vibe business partner,
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:32.920]   four times a week.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.560]   And it's just awesome.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.260]   It's also, frankly, like I talked about,
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:38.840]   making the effort for connection is now
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.400]   I get to hang out with my buddy Jonathan six to eight hours
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.880]   a week when I wasn't previously.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   I am working towards something.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.480]   Because I think that's the other thing.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.040]   Like, I'm in reasonably good shape.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.760]   So it's not like I'm going from couch potato
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.640]   to trying to be Mr. Olympia.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.000]   That's not what we're doing here.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.780]   But when I go into the gym, when I go into CrossFit, I love it.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.040]   But it doesn't feel like I'm working towards something.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.000]   I think having goals and having tangible improvements
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   and having an accountability partner
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.840]   are really going to benefit me.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:09.840]   We're in week two here.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.080]   This is workout number eight.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.560]   So it's a very small sample size.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.160]   But I think the conjunction of all of these things
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.840]   are really working pretty well.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.200]   And then it's a mindset of exploration
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.440]   and just wanting to be as healthy as I possibly can.
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.200]   Because frankly, I'm 43 years old,
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.360]   which I still can't believe.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.320]   And I'm not getting any younger, obviously.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.320]   And the time is now.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.440]   That's how I'm thinking about it.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.120]   I'm turning 39 this year.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.600]   And my goal is to dial in health before I turn 40.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.600]   I did an episode with Dr. Jordan Schlein.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.920]   We talked about I've got high cholesterol and then
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:42.800]   the impact of that.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.920]   That's the thing that I'm tackling first.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:49.880]   And through a combo of both medicine and lifestyle changes.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.600]   But I'm very early in that journey.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.040]   When you have two small kids and you start a podcast
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.400]   and you go full time on it, I felt like for a while
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.600]   I was treading water.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.240]   And now I'm like, OK, we're starting
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.600]   to get things dialed in.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.920]   Need to get the exercise back on the regular regime.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.680]   I think we've been doing well with food.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.920]   So I'm not too worried there.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.760]   But that's the big one I'm focused on right now.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.120]   Going back to very early conversation,
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.920]   I was talking about apps and how it's crazy to spend money.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.680]   It's crazy how medical things are the same.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.160]   It seems wild to pay for a doctor that
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.800]   isn't covered by your insurance or to pay for a treatment
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.200]   or to pay to get blood work done or blood analysis or DNA
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.680]   analysis, all these things.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:33.480]   But it also seems crazy to not allocate some portion
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.160]   of your budget to your health.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.000]   And so we actually had a conversation
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.880]   on that episode a few weeks ago about how
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.560]   do you think about what to allocate
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.240]   in your budget towards health.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.720]   And after the fact that I emailed Jordan, I was like,
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.280]   hey, I'm thinking about a doctor.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.880]   So Jordan runs a concierge practice
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.240]   that for me is not within the budget
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.400]   that I want for my health.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.520]   It's quite expensive.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.200]   But I was like, do you know someone
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.800]   that I could work with that's not as expensive?
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.840]   And he was like, what's your budget?
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.920]   And I was like, I don't know.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.760]   And then I asked Amy.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.280]   And I was like, what's our budget for health?
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.480]   And we're like, I don't know.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.760]   So it's something that I need an answer to,
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.320]   because I'm not necessarily always the budgeting type.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.120]   But a budget gives you permission to spend.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.560]   And so in some areas, I feel like I don't necessarily
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.200]   need a budget.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.620]   I know what's a reasonable amount
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.080]   to spend just instinctively.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.960]   But with health, I feel like I need to create a budget.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.480]   And I might even start doing this with an FSA,
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.160]   though open enrollment just ended,
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.280]   so I've got to wait a year.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.760]   But I feel like I need to force myself
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.600]   to be comfortable spending money on health.
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.280]   And if I could create a budget that says,
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.440]   you have $2,000 to spend on health,
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.040]   and maybe the answer is you say, whatever's not here,
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.320]   we're going to give away.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.440]   Something that makes it a little bit more accountable.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.840]   With an FSA, it would be like that.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.360]   Whatever you don't spend, you actually can't use.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.000]   You lose it.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.240]   I would encourage anyone who has an expiring FSA
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.520]   to go buy stuff that a local shelter needs
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.080]   and don't let it go to waste.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.920]   But I want to create something there
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.800]   because I feel like I need to force myself
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.920]   to spend more on my health.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.580]   That's a big one.
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.280]   We had a whole list of 10 or 12 bullets
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.960]   of what we want to focus on with health.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.760]   We're going to have to save that for the next time.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.800]   Yeah, to be continued.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.800]   We didn't get to travel and some of that stuff.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:04.960]   So we got a lot.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.840]   Brad's superpower is teaching his kids
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.960]   all these amazing lessons.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.200]   So we're going to get to that.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.640]   But I feel like we hit on a lot.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.960]   I'm like jazzed to go do a lot of the things
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.320]   we talked about that you shared.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.600]   This was awesome.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.200]   Yeah, I knew this was going to be fun.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.280]   It worked out even better than I anticipated.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.400]   And it's pretty wild.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.880]   We have so many of these things, A, to follow up on.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.240]   This will be some accountability.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.280]   But B, there's all these topics we didn't get to.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.760]   I'm up for doing this a handful of times a year minimum.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.960]   I think this would be awesome.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.000]   I think it'll be fun and super valuable.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.420]   And obviously, it's always good to talk to you, my friend.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.000]   Selfishly, that's the best part.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.040]   So I would say, if you're listening, if you like this
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.640]   or don't like it, I mean, genuinely,
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.800]   if you listen to this and you're like,
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.600]   this was not a good episode, please
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.200]   let me know.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.240]   I want to create content that you like.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.920]   Brad and I can have this conversation
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.520]   and not record it or record it.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.840]   We're going to have it anyways.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.240]   So let us know.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.920]   But if you do like it, send us topics
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.080]   that you think would be fun.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.580]   But if you have questions that might
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.200]   be better suited for a conversation than just
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.040]   a response, send them in.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.840]   And unless we get a bunch of bad feedback,
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.040]   we'll probably do this again.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.320]   And we'll see where it goes.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:06.880]   Nice.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.200]   Yeah, sounds like a plan.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:08.680]   Awesome.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.080]   Very, very cool, Chris.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:10.960]   Always good at chat.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.880]   And yeah, until next time, please send in the feedback.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.600]   The cool thing is we could talk about anything.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.920]   What's fun about these conceptualized random shows
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.920]   is it can be anything.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.440]   All right.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.560]   Thanks for being here.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.480]   Look forward to the next one.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.920]   I hope you enjoyed episode 100.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.520]   And honestly, thank you so much for all the support
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.440]   the last two years.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.840]   I really don't know if I could have
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.680]   kept going if I didn't know all of you
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.160]   were here with me for the journey.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.760]   So I am excited for everything 2023
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.200]   will have in store for all the hacks.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.200]   And I can't wait to share more of that with you.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.760]   Finally, one quick reminder to go check out Brad's podcast,
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.480]   Choose a Five, which is awesome.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:48.040]   If you have any feedback on the show, questions for me,
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.160]   or just want to say hi, I'm Chris at allthehacks.com.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.160]   That's it for this week.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.240]   See you next week.
