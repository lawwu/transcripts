[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   Hey, everybody, welcome to the all in podcast. I'm your moderator for the week Dave Friedberg
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.960]   Not the world's greatest moderator. This show is gonna be a bit of a shortened version at the back end of the pod today
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.600]   We actually are gonna show some Q&A from Jason's launch summit, which he held in Napa Valley this week great event
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.400]   Thanks for having us up there
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.840]   Jkal, thanks for coming great speakers great content and we did a live Q&A
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.500]   For the all-in pod with the audience there which will transition to about halfway through through the show today
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.080]   Jkal, thanks for your hospitality. Oh, yeah. Thanks for having me the fun birthday party the poker night
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.120]   We had a great time. I still don't know what I was doing there. You were meeting some of your LPs
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.240]   It was like a dog and pony show Jkal was using us as some sort of dog and pony show to raise money
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.640]   Zach did you really have LPs there that you would never met? No. Yes
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.080]   Hold on a second. I had one LP there who I have definitely met many times before
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.800]   Okay, she told us she'd never met you she wanted an introduction
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.920]   So maybe she's getting into the spirit of all-in and joking with you
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.880]   But you had a three-hour meeting with one of your LPs as I heard she talked about
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.740]   Yeah, she said she had like two or three hours with you mother you with us today. What's going on?
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.200]   You there buddy? Chamath is very drunk. By the way, he brought up his own wine. He started margaritas at 2 o'clock
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.920]   He was drunk by the time we got there. What? He showed up
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.180]   He was day drinking margaritas in the Sun
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.100]   Oh, and then we showed up and he was like falling asleep by the time we were done with the stage
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.720]   You know, by the way politics is one of these incredible things where you see the meanest people
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.240]   come out of the woodwork when you
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.420]   Even feign support for somebody that they don't support now that it's out there that sax and I are doing this fundraiser for RFK
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.420]   Oh, yeah, if you look at Twitter
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.760]   some of like the
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.840]   the
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.640]   Democratic surrogates are out just
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.240]   Smacking me and sax around and it's incredible
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.080]   These people are like the biggest
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.600]   imposter loser clowns
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:31.360]   They've never literally done anything in their whole life and then they show up and then they just like how dare you work and help
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.020]   Build a company. How dare you help build another company?
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.160]   How dare you help now fund other companies?
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.520]   I am a talking mouthpiece who's never done anything except work in one administration as a speechwriter and now I think you guys suck balls
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.280]   It's like give me a break. Mm-hmm
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.120]   So you are you a little kind of emotional about that today?
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.400]   I love actually I love critiques actually because I think like you can learn a lot from critiques, but then when mids just
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.960]   spew I
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.240]   Just get annoyed. I think mids should not be allowed to talk. Yeah. Well, that's just my thought there goes half the internet sex
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.640]   Are your Republican?
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.400]   cohort friends
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.600]   Upset about you hosting a fundraiser for RFK. I've got none of that. None of that
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.200]   That's interesting. What's your take on that?
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.360]   Yeah, do Republicans generally think that it's a good thing if our a kid jr
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.080]   Gets the Democratic nomination because he will be easily beatable. I don't think they're thinking that way. I think that there's a
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.360]   respect
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.280]   For RFK jr. Among many Republicans because he's speaking out on issues that they care about like I've talked about he's denouncing censorship
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.280]   he's in favor of free speech is in favor of civil liberties and
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.720]   You know not the this massive surveillance state. He's speaking out in favor of peace instead of war. He's speaking out on the border
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.440]   He had this amazing video. That was great a couple of days ago where he went to the border in Yuma, Arizona
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.200]   At 2 a.m. In the morning
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.360]   And he shows he shows where the border wall ends and where the border wall ends the line
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.840]   Begins and people from all over the world are just entering
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.720]   Through this hole in the wall in a never-ending stream of people and then they get loaded onto buses
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.320]   Provided by the government and then they get handed it a ticket to supposedly appear in court to resolve their case in three or four years
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.680]   And they're never heard from again and they're dispersed all over the country
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.000]   What I don't understand is if the federal government can get its act together enough to provide buses
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.200]   Why can't they get their act together enough to plug the hole in the wall? It's absurd
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.480]   This is like an act of sabotage against the United States. And so he's there just pointing this out
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.160]   I've never seen anything like this before
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.520]   It was interesting as a as a Democrat to do this because that's typically kind of a Republican
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.240]   Point right and some of the commentary made about RFK jr
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.680]   I think it was in the New York Times this week or someone that covered his candidacy one of the big media
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.920]   companies
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:07.400]   Highlighted how much of his agenda seems to be a Republican talking point agenda. Does that sound accurate?
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.800]   Even most people in the country who identify as Democrats would be against having an open border
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.080]   That's what we're talking about when there's a hole in the wall and people can just start forming a line and then once they get through
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.720]   The line, right? They're literally just hold on. They're basically distributed throughout the country on buses
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.880]   I don't think most people in the country even Democrats would support that
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.440]   But what he's violating here is the press blackout on what's really going on at the border
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.820]   So you're right. Like the only you went there. Yeah, but other Republican talking points. So the
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.520]   points around the vaccine
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.140]   Republican well, he's expressed obviously concerns about vaccines preceding the kovat vaccine
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.920]   I don't know whether he's right about that or not
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.240]   I'm not willing to say whether he's right or wrong about that because I just don't know enough
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.560]   I think he's definitely right about the inefficacy of the kovat vaccine
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.480]   We've talked about this before even Bill Gates admits now that the vaccine doesn't work
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.560]   It's too short acting and it doesn't hold up against very it's not a vaccine. Let's just
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.600]   You from getting the illness. It's a death reduction shot. It was a revenue grab by big pharma
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.360]   plastered with
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.240]   Non-scientific thinking from a bunch of people who should have known better Wow
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.480]   I think you just got our so much
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.200]   Is just the truth hold on what you must have said is just like the factual reality and and
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.120]   You can't get that from the mainstream media. Like there's no
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.560]   Re-evaluation. There's no appraisal. They control what we see in here
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.760]   It's like prov to level in terms of the propaganda and that's why I think RFK jr. Is so interesting is because he is
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.240]   Blowing up what the mainstream media wants to control the really interesting thing about him going to the border
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.840]   I agree with sax is hey
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.560]   let's just have a discussion about this and look at the actual facts on the ground that we can agree on and
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.840]   What he actually did was he pierced the veil of like this is an issue about a certain group of people
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.200]   He was there and there are people from Afghanistan China all over the world coming in
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.800]   He made the point that this isn't just about one country and that these people are suffering and that I thought was like another really
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.320]   Important highlight these people are being trafficked
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.280]   They're you know being abused at the border and that it's gonna cost us 10 million a mile to secure the border
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:29.800]   It's a really great talking about it and he's done this with Ukraine as well where he emphasizes the humanitarian aspect of it
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.520]   Yes, and talking about it and I think Republicans should adopt some of that
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.000]   He rhetoric and to Chamath's point. I think it's it is. I think it's a money grab Chamath
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.680]   I do think it lowered death rates
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.920]   But you know, I do think piercing the veil on this and none of us are still getting boosted because we know they don't
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:55.540]   I'm not debating vaccines and politics. We're moving on. We're gonna talk about crypto. So this week the SEC. There we go. Serious action
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.840]   against Binance and coinbase
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:05.740]   You know pretty significant pretty loud SEC filed 13 charges against finance entities and the founders CC
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.200]   charges include operating unregistered
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.360]   securities exchanges broker dealers and clearing agencies
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:19.040]   misrepresenting their trading controls and their oversight on the Binance US platform and the unregistered offer and sale of
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.000]   Securities the next day. They sought a temporary restraining order to freeze finances US assets and
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.820]   Then on Tuesday the SEC sued coinbase
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:36.040]   over their exchange and their staking programs stock dropped 12% the SEC said that
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:44.720]   The company was operating an unregistered exchange and broker and that 13 of their assets listed on their platform were considered crypto asset
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.320]   securities
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.680]   Brian Armstrong
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.000]   Obviously has been on the pod several times
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.860]   Said he's not shutting down his staking service and said regarding the SEC complaint against us today
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.560]   We're proud to represent the industry in court to finally get some clarity around crypto rules
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.460]   He's generally made the statement that he has tried multiple times to register with the SEC
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:10.800]   They have not had a mechanism for him to register. They have tried to do everything by the book and that the SEC
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.680]   approved their IPO filing knowing full well the details of their business and their operating model and
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.820]   Still allowed them to go public on a US securities exchange
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:27.840]   Despite full knowledge about their business. Chamath does anything change this week based on the SEC's action or is this just a continuation of
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.360]   You know crypto has been
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.000]   Rolled back and will continue to roll back here in the US
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.240]   Or is this something new and a new action and opens up a new front on the the government versus crypto?
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.520]   It's a good question. I think there's two ways to look at this one is
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.600]   The conspiracy theorist way which you see a lot of on
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:58.680]   Twitter which is this idea that crypto is making all of these inroads as
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.100]   a replacement mechanism for
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:10.600]   Fiat currency and so governments are really now invested in trying to shut it down. I think that's
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:15.320]   Largely untrue and then there's the more simple basic reality
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.460]   Which is that there was one part of the SEC
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:26.440]   That frankly didn't do the job that they were supposed to by either allowing a few of these crypto companies or crypto businesses
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:33.640]   To go public either a standalone businesses or as part of other businesses. So Coinbase Robin Hood, etc
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:40.480]   And then there's this part of the enforcement action after this FTX fiasco, which is a lot of CYA
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.960]   Covering your ass by the SEC
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.700]   Especially because it looked like they had some cozy relationships with them
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.200]   And so they're coming down hard and they're going to go and systematically dismantle
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:59.880]   The largest actors and they're going to go through the value chain. So I think the obvious place that they're looking now or
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.720]   The exchanges they'll look at the custodial services
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.760]   they will not approve any ETFs and
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.720]   then eventually I do think it trickles into all of the staking services and
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:20.480]   Eventually, I think it'll touch the venture community and all of those firms and funds that had a huge robust business in
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.920]   staking
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:30.560]   These crypto projects in order to get coins like founding coins and then being able to sell them J. Kel
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.520]   I mean, I've been talking about this since the beginning because I
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.360]   bought
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.440]   Bitcoin and wrote about Bitcoin when it was maybe 25 cents and then again when it was a hundred
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.840]   So I've been following this for a long time. And I think
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.140]   Thinking from first principles to stepping back for a moment
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.240]   You know what we do in technology is fundamentally disruptive
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.040]   If it's at its best if it's truly gonna be important in the world
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:59.400]   and when you hear that word disruption, you kind of file it as a buzzword, but what it really means at its core is like
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.720]   Competition and it's not just competition disruption when you say disruption
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.800]   you're talking about existential competition two people go in the ring one person comes out like
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:14.520]   Somebody's gonna get really fucked up. And if you people keep bringing up, oh, you're an investor in uber. They broke the rules
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.080]   They bent the rules
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:23.120]   Uber was going against caps. Airbnb was going against like hotels. We work was going against like long-term real estate leases
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.360]   When you look at all those
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:31.880]   Disruptive technologies and what they did at their core. They disrupted on behalf of consumers and
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.400]   Lowered prices increased choice, etc. When you get crypto
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:41.500]   The crypto crowd literally said we are going to replace fiat currency fiat currency
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.720]   Is the government and so my thesis from the beginning was if the government has a way to stop this
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.280]   They do not want to be disrupted. What what is a government at its core? It's a military
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:57.280]   It's a bunch of rules laws and it's money
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:03.960]   that's the kind of pillars of any government's power we knew the government wasn't gonna give this up and
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:11.480]   You know, they they after round and found out but the truth is the and this is where I have some sympathy for the crypto
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.760]   People not the people who are just committing crime with the whole way and just dumping these bags on retail, etc
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.840]   But we do want to have this innovation here
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:25.120]   There are some innovative aspects to it, but Gary Gensler said listen, you already have electronic money. It's called money in the United States
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.920]   We already have these services. You don't need this consumers don't need it
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.080]   And you have to understand the SEC's function in the world to understand why they're taking this action
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.200]   Their function is to protect investors
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.160]   Investors lost a bunch of money. Therefore they are going to retroactively
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.440]   inflict pain and hold people accountable for
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:48.960]   Their mandate which is to protect investors. You could have easily resolved this the SEC and
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:56.640]   The companies could resolve this the companies could have followed these things as securities and only allowed accredited investors top 5% of the country
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.240]   People will make over 200k a year. They didn't do that. They said anybody can buy these
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.840]   Well, that's just not how it works in America and it should change
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.600]   I think everybody should be able to buy any security they want in America
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.160]   Just like anybody can go play blackjack and the easiest solution for this just passed in Congress this week
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.240]   And we'll go to the Senate and be a lawsuit
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.360]   I think allowing every American the other 94% to take a test and become accredited if that happens
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.120]   You take a test just like you take a driver's license test. I know what diversification is
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.880]   I know how risky these are once you take that 50
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:34.680]   Question test you become accredited and then you can buy these coins if you want to and that's really the easiest path to resolution here
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:40.120]   So we don't have Brian Armstrong move his company to the Middle East or you know an island in the Caribbean
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.760]   Which is what he's gonna do I predict so, okay. Well look we've seen
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:50.360]   This bill make its way I think through is it going to the Senate next or is it going to the Senate?
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.960]   Yeah, go to the Senate. So let's see if it gets done. I think it's a it's a good point one thing. I'll point out
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   when
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.200]   Individual investors were making money
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:07.760]   Because all of these asset values were inflating all of the coins were growing and were climbing in value everyone felt good
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.760]   There was an emergent cry that we all want to have access to these new instruments
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:21.400]   we all have a right to make these investments and to own these assets and then as the asset values declined and
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:29.320]   Individual investors began losing money the emergent cry is where was the government to help save and protect us?
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.720]   And so the SEC I would argue was probably a little bit hindered
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.160]   when the market was inflating in being able to step in and take action because that would have been
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.940]   Counter to the cries of the retail market
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.600]   But as the retail market took their their hits
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.880]   The SEC has to step in and Congress steps in and everyone starts to say it's time to act
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:55.200]   We should have acted sooner and this was a you know, fairly predictable. I think what's happening is more nefarious than that
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.240]   so
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.880]   The SEC is doing two different things. They're alleging two different kinds of
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:07.160]   Crimes one set has to do with protecting
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.680]   investors from having their funds
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:17.480]   Stolen on these exchanges or at least commingled FTX did that right where they basically took customer deposits and stole them
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.080]   What finance is accused of is taking customer deposits?
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.440]   Maybe not stealing them but commingling them with company funds that should be looked at and I think
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.200]   Crypto customers should be protected against that. However the case against coinbase. They're alleging a completely different set of facts, which is
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:40.400]   Effectively what Gensler and the SEC are saying is that it is not legal to operate a crypto exchange in the United States
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.680]   That is what the SEC is saying
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:49.560]   Because coinbase has basically done everything right and I believe that Gensler is far exceeding his authority and stating something like that
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:55.640]   It is not up to the chairman of the SEC to say that Americans should not be holding crypto
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.920]   Why as a free people should we not be able to buy crypto if we want to?
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.560]   You know, why shouldn't we be able to buy Bitcoin now? Maybe you apply rules around
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:13.040]   Accredited investor status there should be protections against unsophisticated investors buying stuff or getting defrauded. That's fine
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.920]   that's the framework that Brian Armstrong is asking for but
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.560]   everyone should understand what the SEC is doing right now is
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.760]   Basically usurping congressional authority
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.600]   It should be Congress that makes the law if Congress wants to ban
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:33.960]   crypto exchanges in the United States and prevent the citizen the United States from owning crypto let Congress do it it should not be
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:41.000]   Up to Gensler to do that. And the question is why is Gensler going this far when previously he had relationships in the industry?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.560]   apparently
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.200]   He was a consultant to finance and even worse
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:52.480]   he was talking to FTX about giving them some special status and I think the reason is the the scuttlebutt is that
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.160]   He has an alliance with Elizabeth Warren and the rumor is that you know
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.960]   She will make him Treasury Secretary if he basically destroys crypto in the US. Sorry, where's the evidence for that?
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.360]   That's just someone's rumor and speculation. This is the scuttlebutt in the industry
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.000]   Okay, so it's
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.160]   This is in fact the back channel just to be clear rumor and innuendo is what you're saying
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:19.040]   No, look what I would say is clear is that Gensler and Elizabeth Warren have an alliance it to destroy crypto in the US
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.520]   This was speculated about before with operation choke point, but now it's clear. They're trying to shut down
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:30.260]   We've talked about on the show before it was a series of actions. Take what you do when you're in a hotel at night
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:38.540]   Operation choke point was a series of actions by the US government to basically destroy all the on ramps to crypto
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.780]   So you couldn't get money into the system now
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.860]   They're going further and they're basically saying it is illegal to operate a crypto exchange in the United States. So
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.280]   Yes
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.780]   I can explain why you're wrong what they're saying is it's not just the exchange. It's that the exchange contains
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:02.260]   Unregistered security, so it's a more nuanced point. I think I agree security. Could you trade?
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:07.980]   Well, if it passes the Howey test or it is registered and there are people who have actually
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:16.460]   Crypto passes the Howey test. No, they're going back on that. You could pass it if you limited it to accredited investors and the fact is
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.020]   Brian Armstrong
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.660]   finance and a lot of crypto projects refused to exclude
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.800]   Non-accredited investors and I watch this happen up close and personal
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:34.360]   You're right about the unregistered securities thing. They're trying to say that all crypto is unregistered security
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   No, they said
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.880]   They literally they named them sacks in the in the lawsuit. They named the 16 or 13. What was it Friedberg?
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.200]   So they they know how to it was dirty. They know how to craft this
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.600]   They're saying for these specific 13 now the industry does feel you're correct and the back channel is everybody's against us
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.440]   But if they had just registered these they would not a problem. I don't think they're gonna
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:01.800]   He doesn't have a way of registering
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.640]   They do they don't want to so they claim they don't have a way of registering
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.640]   They could register it just like we all
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.920]   Lot of people tweeting about this that the SEC has put out statements saying our door is open come talk to us
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.060]   There is no open door. There is no one to talk to they have no idea how to get registered
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:24.040]   How do you think this is gonna get resolved Armstrong's talk publicly about going to Congress?
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.920]   To try and get some clarifying law passed. Are you familiar with any of the
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.920]   Any of the drafting that might be going on to support his cause here or do you think it's gonna get settled in the courts?
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.800]   First of all, I think I think Brian Armstrong is is a really really really good entrepreneur
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.240]   And I'm a really big fan of his
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.840]   That said I just don't think that there's a lot of political support
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:57.780]   To visit this issue right now and so unfortunately, I'm pretty
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.400]   Skeptical that you're gonna see any form of legislation pass. I
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.040]   unfortunately think that
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:16.880]   The SEC has by and large put the entire sector into mate and so I think that what Jason said
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.000]   Is largely right
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.960]   which is that it's gonna force these companies to preserve enterprise value to leave the United States and
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.200]   to jurisdictionally operate from a different place and to
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.400]   Basically IP block and I PK us
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.800]   Residents from using their products and services. I
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:43.560]   Also think that they're gonna have to pay large fines. And so the only thing that'll be left is to adjudicate
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.560]   All of the staking stuff that that happened and whether that was right or wrong, right?
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.440]   So the court it'll get settled it'll get decided. I agree with that
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:58.840]   And I think I think that when you start talking about minutiae like well these 16 cryptos are okay or not
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.640]   Okay, no look you're kind of missing the point
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.320]   The government led by Gensler is in a full assault on crypto
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.920]   And the goal is basically to either destroy it in the US or drive it offshore
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.360]   Chamath is right about that and the question is why and I think Jake how you made the point that
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.920]   progressives like Elizabeth Warren see crypto as
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.120]   Competition to fiat currency and they do not want there to be a competitor. Now. What is the reason for that?
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.960]   I think it's because of their radical spending schemes
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:34.080]   Remember in the first years of the Biden administration the progressives wanted a four and a half trillion dollar build back better bill. Remember
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.680]   Larry Summers
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.080]   told them that you're gonna cause inflation and
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.120]   Even the 750 billion dollars scoped down version that they ultimately passed
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.280]   Caused a lot of inflation and it caused the problems that we have now that we're seeing in the economy
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.000]   But they wanted four and a half trillion and when people were opposed to and said we couldn't fund this they were in favor of
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   minting trillion dollar coins
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Yeah, so look these are people who don't want any check on their ability to spend down the full faith and credit the United States
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.040]   They would basically spend all the money that we have they would basically eat the seed corn or don't have
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.600]   That we don't have that
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:16.720]   I think you guys agree we should not be spending and that is why they're the faction in our political system who are most against crypto
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.760]   The two things can be free bird. Hold on. I gotta I gotta respond to two things can be true
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.120]   One the government doesn't want to give up control of fiat. I agree with that
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:30.440]   Second thing that's also true is that this group of people did not want to play by the rules. They knew the rules
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.520]   They explicitly broke them for profit. That's why they have them dead to rights
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:39.840]   You can name this operation choke point. You can brand it you can put out any conspiracy theory you want
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.560]   They did have the option. Why is it a conspiracy theory? You agree? They're trying to run these guys
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:49.720]   I agree. I said two things can be true at the same time David these this is a tolerance for ambiguity being able to hold
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:57.200]   And they don't want to give up control yeah, that's what's happening. That's the rule you have to follow security
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.280]   You have to only allow three podcasts. You said that coinbase was a good actor. I
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.500]   Believe they have good intentions. Yes, I don't believe the other people do I do believe
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.280]   That coinbase is in violation of the law
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:14.200]   I believe the securities they trading are in violation of law and that's obvious if you but I believe that law should change
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.200]   Let me give you a security are
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.920]   Securities J Cal. Let me give you a third point and sacks
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.240]   Elizabeth Warren she may be motivated by the intention to preserve
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.080]   the authority of the Fiat
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   But is it not also possible that a large number of people lost a lot of money?
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.240]   That they worked hard for and they used to buy crypto assets
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.400]   And then the value of those assets went down and those people lost a lot of value
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.840]   I had there was a group of guys that are house painters that painted my house
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:53.520]   Two summers ago and they painted the whole house. They were here every day for hours every day. So I got to speak to these guys and
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.360]   These these guys were house painters, you know, they they work for an hourly wage
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.880]   They do fairly well
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.600]   But every lunch break every break they got all that they would talk about with one another
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.440]   Was what cryptocurrency they're buying and trading in and out of with the whole intention of making money
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.760]   They all believed that they had a good point of view because they read something on the internet or got some tweet
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.840]   Or got some text or saw something on tik-tok about this one
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:25.840]   Crypto asset or this crypto asset and they were trading in and out and all of the money that these guys worked hard for
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.320]   Was being invested in crypto assets. You're right. That set of facts is not great. However, I don't think that's the motivation
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:38.080]   I think the motivation is to basically end crypto as a potential competitor to fiat money in the United States
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.560]   That's the motivation and they're gonna use those fact patterns to basically
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:48.760]   Support that because look turn up because we could handle that. Okay, we could do the accredited investor test
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:54.000]   there should be a framework or set of guidelines under which it is legal for people to buy and
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.880]   Hold or trade crypto in the United States and lose all that Brian has been asking for
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:04.280]   Let's give us a framework and Genzer is not giving a framework. He's just trying to basically put them out of business
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.800]   Okay, look, I think we've gone around this topic. This has been a great conversation
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.080]   I'm gonna move forward to the next topic which I think is
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.720]   really interesting in the vein of both
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:25.440]   De-globalization but also, you know the scale at which venture firms have gotten to Sequoia decided this week and announced publicly that
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.800]   They're splitting off their China and India Southeast Asia funds as you guys
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.840]   Obviously know Sequoia capital is a venture capital firm and within that firm
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.040]   They manage multiple funds some of the funds that they've raised and managed have been
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:48.160]   Specifically targeted in China where they have 56 billion dollars. I don't know if this number is accurate
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:54.920]   but that's an incredible number 56 billion dollars of assets under management focus just in Sequoia China and then they have a
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.360]   Sequoia India fund
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.960]   Which has about four billion dollars of capital raised in just the last three years
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:09.680]   And now they are separating the management company and the oversight of those funds into separate management companies. So Sequoia
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.720]   Capital will no longer oversee those China funds a new firm has been formed called Sequoia China
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   That is now owned and run by a separate management team based in China and Sequoia
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.680]   India is now called peak 15 partners, which is owned and operated by a separate team of managers out of India
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.520]   Roloff Botha will manage the US and European Sequoia capital
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.480]   Neil Chen will oversee Sequoia China and Shailendra Singh
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.760]   Neil Chen, I'm sorry, Neil Chen and Shailendra Singh will oversee Sequoia India
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:46.640]   I guess this is a question of the Sequoia get too big or are they caving to pressure of
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:54.080]   The political issues arising with having deep relationships and ties with China or as they have said a lot of competition
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:00.680]   Between these different portfolios and companies within these portfolios amongst each other Chamath. What's your read on the action?
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.840]   Is there anything to read into this and anything to extrapolate from it?
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.680]   well, it's been a parade of missteps for Sequoia in the last couple of years and
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.360]   I'll let Sequoia figure out who to blame for this. But the reality is
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.320]   They I think felt a lot of FOMO post SoftBank
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:26.400]   they raised this large mega fund that kind of straddled all of the sub funds and straddled all of the regions and so
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:33.280]   They dangled the carrot of trying to get into the early stage US fund by investing in this big mega fund that also had China
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.280]   and India exposure and growth exposure
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.920]   then they tried this like
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.640]   very convoluted evergreen
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:48.920]   Structure right before the market fell apart where you could basically become a permanent capital vehicle and
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:57.440]   As far as I can tell from the outside looking in it just seems like a taxed tax play for the GP's to not have to
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.120]   sell and realize capital gains
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.240]   But that only works when the stock market keeps going up, which it didn't and then it's summarily
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:11.400]   Crushed tech stocks 80 or 90 percent. So that was a misstep and then when you put all these things together
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:18.920]   Now that China is contracting and we said this before I think China is largely uninvestable for the next 30 or 40 years
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.400]   It just makes sense to jettison
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   Now I will say though that Neil Shen is elite if you consider in investing, I would say I have a simple rubric
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:36.320]   Anybody who's made more than a billion dollars for themselves as an investor. I consider elite Neil Shen is elite
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.440]   And so he'll do just fine
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.240]   Running that's Sequoia
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.960]   China business. I was surprised about why they would allow
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:51.560]   India to leave there's nobody that elite at Sequoia India by that rubric
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:58.600]   But India is a country growing at 6% a year. It literally looks like China in 2008 and 9 and
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.720]   So I'm not sure why you would let them leave
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:09.360]   I think that you would want to attach them to yourself because it makes the US business look better. You probably gets
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.920]   differentiated and smoothed out returns
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:19.840]   But I think this is a little bit of taking you of competition to mark that there was competition between the different portfolio companies
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.440]   And it was leading to conflict I
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.760]   Mean, that's dumb that happens in the United States
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:32.360]   Sequoia has always been known to fund everybody that they think will make money no matter how much they compete
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.240]   When they back YouTube and Moritz was sitting on the board at Google and
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.240]   Sure, look Sequoia Sequoia as an organization is elite
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   They're there to make money for their LPs period end of story. And so all of the other words that can go in any press release
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.160]   Basically, I think try to hide the fact that this is an organization that's had some missteps
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:58.680]   They're not on solid ground. They've lost a lot of money and they're trying to figure out what to do next. I
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:04.560]   however, if I was running that organization would have probably done nothing and
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.400]   Just let the dust settle
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:13.200]   And I think that all of these actions are too close together and it's a little bit to me of
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.000]   Flailing in the water and so I don't think it was a good idea
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.480]   To let India leave. I think it made a ton of sense to cut China
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:27.040]   But I think all of this stuff happened started happening a few years ago
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.360]   Starting with that eight or nine billion dollar mega fund that they raised to try to compete with softbank
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.360]   Saks any read on this?
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.600]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's a example a prominent example of decoupling and
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:46.640]   Globalization going on. So I agree. We have to treat India and China separately with respect to China. I just think it's become
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.360]   Harder and harder for Americans to do business in China
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:56.440]   both because we don't really have the visibility into that system and
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:03.160]   There's too much political uncertainty. So kind of touch my point about it being increasingly uninvestable
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.440]   But I also think that geopolitical concerns
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:11.520]   It's just very hard to straddle those concerns now because the geopolitical competition is heating up so much
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.760]   I think it's investable for people like Neil Shen who are insiders in that system
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:23.440]   So I think you know elite Chinese investors can I'm sure make money in China over the next few decades
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.960]   But I think it's just too hard for Americans to figure that out. So I think
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.340]   Them parting ways makes a lot of sense. I think it's gonna simplify Sequoia's life a lot
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:39.880]   India I I agree with Jama that that's sort of a different question because India is gonna be a huge growth economy over the next
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.320]   Few decades and they are a US ally
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.440]   So it doesn't pose the same geopolitical risk
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:52.760]   but my guess is that it was just kind of unwieldy that it's too unwieldy to
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.680]   Kind of merge funding sources and firm management
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.720]   Across two firms that are really pretty different right the US aquarium firm and then this Indian firm
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.920]   So my guess is they just decoupled because it was just getting too hard to manage
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.240]   And if you're an LP, don't you just want the ability to say?
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:15.080]   Okay, I'm gonna allocate this much money to India and I'm gonna allocate this much money to the US
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.960]   I think LP is probably like it to Sequoia China is frankly over the last
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:25.920]   15 or 20 years as good and probably is numerically better than Sequoia us
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:31.600]   So that was an elite organization just by itself Sequoia India
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.240]   I don't think has much to talk about and so maybe what?
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.880]   Roloff decided is this team is just not very good
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.960]   So we might as well just cut it and we can revisit it later
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:45.640]   They probably have some number of years of a non compete and then they could come back into the market five years with a totally
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.480]   New team and that may be easier
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.480]   So maybe easier just as just maybe the team actually wanted to be separate
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.720]   Look, it's hard to cross returns from two totally different funds, right?
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:02.320]   Because one side one side is gonna be unhappy with the trade, right? Yeah, I can give you the J
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:07.360]   Cal's got actual information to share. Well, no, I mean I have I think I have the closest
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:12.240]   Investor in your company right Jake. Oh, well, I'm an LP in their funds. They're printing money for me
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:17.480]   They back my second startup rule offs on the board of that company is still with me and I was their first scout
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.080]   When they started the scouts program, which is the highest
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.200]   Percentage performing fund I think they ever had
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:28.480]   Sequoia's when you're our you're our resident Captain America. So as a patriot, how do you feel?
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.200]   Well, they are put that aside. Sequoia is 20% of the Nasdaq
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.800]   This is the greatest venture firm of all time hands down and the Sequoia fund
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.000]   Which shut them off referred to me companies they've invested in companies
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:48.280]   As I guess and so the reason the Sequoia fund came out this evergreen fund was because a lot of their LPs wanted
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.360]   Sequoia to manage the public equities
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.560]   going forward because they didn't want to sell them because they realized bullshit that
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:00.120]   The massive gains the the gains from Google
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.680]   Apple etc of these
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:09.800]   Investments that they did when they were private companies Cisco the gains from public forward were greater than the gains in private
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   And I've been in on these presentations. I've sat through them
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.040]   with the Sequoia team and so
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:21.200]   When you manage those public ones, we've all talked about the denominator problem here
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.160]   The denominator problem is hey, are they venture returns or are they part of the public equity?
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.400]   So at a giant endowment
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.880]   They want to put them into the equities bucket get them out of the venture bucket and Sequoia saw an opportunity there to manage this
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.400]   Evergreen fund I'm sure there are tax advantages to it, of course
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.800]   But with relation to what they did in China and India these these were incredibly
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.400]   Prescient and
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:50.720]   Innovative things they did in 2000 and 2005 when they started India and then China was 2005
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.480]   I believe they found domestic teams. You need domestic teams to do this properly
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.000]   especially in places with different governance and different regulations and
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.640]   It gives them autonomy though. They were incredible investments
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:11.160]   But what's happening right now is all venture investments because of AI and chips and the decoupling with China are now under
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:16.480]   Massive scrutiny so they can say there's brand confusion. You can talk about you know
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:22.600]   Collisions and who's gonna back this Chinese entrepreneur an Indian entrepreneur who also is operating in the US, right?
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:27.360]   These businesses operate in the US. And so what really is happening is
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:33.920]   The government is gonna stop all US venture investing in China. That's what's gonna happen in the coming months
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.560]   And so they're just getting ahead of that and now they will compete
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.360]   And it really has to do with chips and AI
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.200]   Okay, you may have seen some of these stories and nobody's gonna invest your if an American invest in AI in China
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.800]   That's gonna be bad and the same with chips. Yeah, you're right
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:56.760]   There are a bunch of stories about whether US investors should be investing in AI in China and people were saying this was un-american
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.240]   Because it was basically gonna give China an advantage against us in this key industry
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.400]   And I think that point is a good example of what I'm talking about with the geopolitical concerns. It's just getting too complicated
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:15.040]   Yes for Americans to invest in China. It raises too many geopolitical concerns and I think Sequoia is massively simplifying its life
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:21.000]   By just splitting these things up and being out. Did you see Keith for voice tweets on this? Yeah, that's what we're referring to
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.240]   Yeah, Keith for boy tweeted basically like it's un-american to invest in China at this point
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.280]   Yeah, we've talked about this before
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:34.120]   I mean look that the Chinese relationship primarily used to be seen as an economic relationship and people were looking for a win-win
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:39.200]   Basically trade scenarios and it was not seen as a moral to invest in China
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:45.400]   Now the relationship is primarily seen through a geopolitical lens, which is to say the balance of power, which is a zero-sum game
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.480]   It's about you know, how much better is the US doing?
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:54.660]   How much more powerful is it than China and anybody who's perceived as helping China in that rubric now is looked on?
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.920]   Skeptically within the United States about that
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.400]   Well, like I said, I don't think that's gonna change
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.320]   So I think Sequoia is doing the right thing to kind of like I said simplify its life what's your personal opinion? I'm curious
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.320]   I think that
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:15.000]   It should be possible to do business with China without it being seen as either unpatriotic or immoral
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.120]   However, there are strategic
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:22.600]   Technologies that are just gonna be I think it's too hard and too risky to
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.960]   To be supporting China in chips and AI
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:33.280]   Yeah, I mean look if somebody is using Chinese manufacturing to make toys or clothes. I don't think that's fundamentally
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:39.160]   strategic in a geopolitical way, but if you're helping them make
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.360]   The next generation of chips that's gonna raise a lot of questions
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.160]   So what so a VC firm?
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.520]   Freeberg can't take out chips and AI run their investment
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:55.480]   Hold on. I want to say something cuz sure this reminds me of one benchmark actually had benchmark Europe and then they cut it
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.920]   Do you guys remember that? Yeah, I do. Yeah and kind of retrenched. They weren't retrenching from a position of strength
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:04.720]   They were retrenching to reestablish themselves after a bunch of missteps
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.320]   so I think typically these retrenchments happen when there's a little bit of internal chaos and
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:17.240]   Mismanagement and underperformance that's not the case here. I can assure you. Yeah, but I actually think retrenching is good because it simplifies things
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.920]   You want to simplify yours? Yeah, I I totally agree with you
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.600]   My point is when I saw that overlay fund I was like, this is questionable
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:31.320]   but then when I saw that weird evergreen fund that to me just seemed like a tax arb and
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.200]   I thought to myself as a person who's looked at this exact stuff for my own stuff
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.960]   what I did was I just converted it to a family office and
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:45.240]   From a tax perspective. It was much simpler, but that exact same structure
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.400]   I looked at for myself and the reason that that structure exists and Jason
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.440]   I know you want to think it's because these endowments want them to manage public equities
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.240]   I still work with a few endowments and pension systems
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.680]   They don't and the reason they don't is they're not allowed to they're not allowed for concentration purposes
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.640]   They pay other people to manage it
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.600]   They have these outside consultants and for fiduciary
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:11.280]   Perspectives you have to do all of these things with respect to managing risk and one of the most obvious things that these foundations
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:17.280]   Do is they get distributions and they sell they don't hold and so the reason why you'd want to look at the
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.920]   Long-term gains of a stock that you distributed is because the GP sold too early
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.560]   Not the LP and I just don't I think that you should not just be a blind
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:32.320]   Surrogate on this topic and actually really think about well, I mean, I don't think you need to well
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:38.200]   I'm not I'm not and you know square if you look at something like that, you know, Roloff's still on the board of square
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:45.040]   I believe so they Sequoia has realized over time, you know as it's been explained to me as an LP that you know
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:50.520]   these companies grow the outliers continue to grow massively when they become public and
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:55.840]   Sequoia is now staying on the board of those companies and so they actually have the most insight into it because they backed it when
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.160]   It was two people and then they're still on the board
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.160]   That's not the point money is not infinite
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.760]   And if you're a foundation and you're legally obligated to distribute some percentage every year
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:10.480]   You need the money back and the foundations do get to choose some foundations want to go along Harvard or whoever
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.000]   I'm just picking, you know, one of the large ones if somebody's got 30 40 billion dollars
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.400]   They may not need to liquidate that and they might very much
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:23.480]   I'm just the only person that is in a position to actually hold for the long term because it's so tax advantageous is the GP
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.960]   That is why that fund was created and I will bet you if you ask him under oath
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.760]   Why they did it I'll tell you it was for themselves
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.200]   I will people have the church million dollars for charity
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:37.880]   Whatever you want to do
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.280]   I bet you if you put him under oath and you subpoena him and you ask him why he did it
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.560]   He'll say he did it for himself and that's fine
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:48.720]   All I'm saying is that's the kind of complexity that sacks is talking about that does not add to success
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.960]   It is over complexifying something that doesn't need to be complicated
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:58.360]   Yeah, I disagree with you, but we can just move on. Well, we agree to disagree sometimes here on the all-in podcast
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.520]   we're gonna move on for our last topic of the day with the
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.200]   announcement see can we talk messy? No, no, we're not good. We're good because we're gonna do one last topic, which I think is
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.600]   PGA and messy go together. Yeah, so let's just talk about the PGA
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.600]   No, we don't have time guys. I appreciate the messy interest, but we're gonna talk about something less messy
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.840]   Who cares? I think it's pretty interesting for a couple of reasons
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:24.240]   So as you guys know, the PGA tour has been around since 1930
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:32.000]   I think the PGA tour makes 1.6 billion dollars a year if reports are correct. I make 1.6 billion a year boring
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.040]   I mean depends on the year
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.520]   all of the players on the PGA tour are
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.480]   independent contractors
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:45.800]   so Saudi Arabia's public investment fund and this is what I think is one of the more interesting aspects of this story and
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:51.000]   Maybe speaks to a broader kind of set of geopolitical
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.080]   Transitions that are underway the Saudi Arabian public invention
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:02.880]   Public investment fund started Li V golf as an alternative to the PGA tour live golf live golf
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.000]   they invested two billion dollars of capital and
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.320]   offered
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.120]   Guarantees to golfers to come and get on their tour. They ended up
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:16.560]   Offering at one point Tiger Woods reportedly got an 800 million dollar guarantee
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:23.160]   To join their tour which he turned down Phil Mickelson got a reported 200 million dollar guarantee
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:28.720]   Which he took to join the tour Hideki Matsuyama got offered 750 K 750 million
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:34.520]   which I might so seven of the ten top paid golfers in the world actually signed up and
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:43.000]   It caused obviously significant disruption to what has effectively been a monopoly, which is the PGA tour in golf in professional golf
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.680]   and
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.760]   Here we are two years later
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:53.320]   And it was announced this week that live and PGA are merging and the current PGA tour commissioner
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.000]   Jay Moynihan will serve as CEO of the new entity
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.760]   Just by way of reference
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:03.800]   Jay Moynihan makes a reported 14 to 15 million dollars a year in salary as CEO of the PGA tour
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   He will now be CEO of this combined
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:13.280]   Organization one big question mark is how much is he getting paid and did that help secure and solidify this deal getting done?
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:19.440]   But I think another big question is do we think this will actually close will this face regulatory and antitrust scrutiny?
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:27.000]   Will this face CFS because it is the Saudi Arabian public investment fund that is effectively taking a large stake in the PGA tour
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:33.680]   Let's go to our resident professional sports team owner or former minority owner Chamath
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.760]   And he takes on
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.960]   On this announced merger. What does it say about the PGA's ability to hold action?
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.920]   This is what's so crazy about your topic selection
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:50.960]   Messi was offered 1.6 billion dollars personally by the Saudis and you don't want to talk about that because you want to talk about
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.920]   a whole organization playing an antiquated sport that itself generates
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.680]   1.6 billion dollars
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.120]   Welcome to being the moderator
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:07.680]   I don't care about golf. I don't care. The reason this is so controversial is
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:15.640]   That they're calling it sports washing trying to make the reputation of Saudi more palatable in the West by
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.120]   using sports things people love
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:24.560]   the reason this has become controversial is because of the hypocrisy of it the PGA fought against live and
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:33.720]   This guy Jay Moynihan who is the CEO of this he basically evoked the 9/11 families and
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.440]   Went on a whole thing about how evil live was
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:42.400]   Only to then secure the bag and then there's some back channel here about
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.280]   Well, there was a lawsuit between the live golfers, you know
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:50.320]   Who are now banned from playing the PGA when they signed up and antitrust stuff
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:56.320]   And so the hypocrisy of the group is what's being pulled into question here
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:01.200]   Come on, this is why it's important size the players who took the money were ostracized
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.760]   As supporting an evil regime
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:09.800]   Yeah, and now it's clear that they were smart and Tiger should have taken the money and
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.940]   Actually the guy who said as much at the time was was Trump, you know, he
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.760]   Yeah, he nailed it's like one of these
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:28.160]   He's basically said that take the money from live because eventually live in PGA are gonna merge and then the guys who stuck with PGA
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.840]   You're gonna get nothing and they're gonna feel like idiots. He was totally right
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:37.280]   Come on come on, you don't think that that's insane. I mean, come on, it's pretty amazing
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:43.080]   Tell me when you get to messy and the fact that these guys were proclaiming that if you're gonna go join this tour
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.080]   You're joining, you know
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:49.800]   I don't understand whether I don't understand whether you're naive or dumb. This is like about money
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:55.320]   It's always about money professional sports has always been about money. What what are we what are we talking about?
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:02.860]   Money money money money money. There's your answer money drove the answer money drove the split money drove the deals now money drove the merger
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:08.000]   I don't understand. Can we talk about messy, please? It's so much more interesting. Okay, go talk about messy tomorrow. I
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.640]   Mean the messy thing is so incredible
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:14.880]   Because Cristiano Ronaldo went to a team in Saudi
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:21.640]   To play in the August of his career the last two or three years and this has been a thing that started with Pele in
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   The 70s Pele came to the New York
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.200]   Cosmos and played Beckham famously did it as well came to the LA Galaxy
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:34.440]   But Beckham did this one interesting thing, which is he said, okay, I'm gonna come to play in the MLS on
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   One condition really which is I'll take a huge pay cut and all of this stuff
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.360]   But I want an option to buy an expansion team for 25 million bucks
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.960]   Fast forward he ended up buying inter Miami
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.700]   That team is now worth five hundred and eighty five million dollars
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:56.600]   So messy is 36 years old. He's about to enter the August of his career. He's won everything. He's done everything possible
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:00.520]   He is so incredible. I mean, I love him. I love him
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:06.520]   he gets offered four hundred million dollars a year for four years to go play in Saudi Arabia a
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.960]   1.6 billion dollar deal and
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:14.600]   You know, there's no income tax here. So that's like 1.6 billion dollars right in his pocket
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.640]   Except the deal that he did
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.920]   Which was for a lot less upfront is really interesting
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.760]   He basically said I'll come to the United States and play in inter Miami
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.400]   for for the Miami Football Club
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:37.400]   But I am you know, basically, I'm not sure he said this so I'm using my own words. I'm the greatest player in the world
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.520]   Every time I do something magical on the field
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:47.880]   I'm creating content that will sell tickets and create brand awareness and move the interest level of soccer in the United States
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:53.320]   I'm a content creator. So I want a piece of this content and so Apple
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:58.600]   Who signed a two and a half billion dollar ten-year license for the MLS said you're right
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:02.840]   You're probably gonna sell more subscriptions for me. I'll give you a piece of the ref share and
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:09.880]   Then adidas said, you know what? You're right. You're probably gonna sell more shoes for me. I'll give you a piece of those shoes
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.780]   So in one fell swoop, I think what's amazing is
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:19.680]   Messi is not an athlete in this deal. I think going back to a theme that we've talked about a lot is
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.280]   He is this
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.720]   Ultimate penultimate whatever. He's an elite content creator
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.160]   He's the equity who is now creating
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:35.960]   Incredible who will come to the United States to create this incredible content that will move viewership move merchandise
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:41.440]   And he's gonna monetize that so it's effectively like becoming the Jordan brand
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.880]   Getting a piece of Netflix all in one. He has the equity in those businesses basically
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:52.240]   Yeah, there's a subtle point Schmott's making in the deal. You have the person who's responsible for distribution
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.240]   so this would be the same as like the NBA on ABC ESPN or TNT and
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:01.880]   TNT or ESPN saying you know what you're so important LeBron James to play in this or Steph Curry
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:05.960]   We're gonna give you a piece of the subscriptions to ESPN
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:12.320]   So Apple is giving him rev share on their Apple TV League pass for MLS
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.480]   That's nuts like and this is I think it goes back to the live
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:21.840]   Deal with PGA, which is people are looking at these sports leagues and saying let's get creative
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:27.440]   It goes back to a different one. The the NBA just signed a new collective bargaining agreement that they're gonna ratify
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:35.160]   I always thought that the real thing that the NBA Players Association should be asking for equity was equity
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:40.920]   Yeah, and that equity could be phantom equity and the teams because it's clear that in the absence of the players
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   There's no viewership and there's no appreciation in the value of those franchises. And so the idea that LeBron
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.360]   You know Steph Dre KD
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:59.720]   Don't own a huge piece of the underlying equity gains that they're creating in the period in which their players is pretty crazy now
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:07.640]   the ownership their perspective is while we translate that in terms of rev share, but it's really not true because if you look at the
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:13.720]   Kager the IRR of the franchise values versus the K gring of the salaries. They're not equivalent
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.160]   Yeah, so I just think it has huge implications
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:21.120]   to all the professional sports leagues because these big stars
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.720]   Should be asking their agents and their managers. How do I do a deal like Messi?
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:32.600]   I am the ultimate content creator in my league. The dynamics are changing it will it will no longer be an employee
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.360]   Capital labor situation, but capital is merging with labor
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:43.000]   Bravo and labor labor is basically becoming the equity in the equation and they are going to pursue the business just like
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:49.200]   And we're and by the way, the reason we see it happening so much is because of the social media age and it's really incredible
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.800]   It's but it wasn't like that. I know you have more to say we all have more to say
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.600]   I just want to highlight I need to go I have to go to a kindergarten graduation. Congratulations
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:05.080]   Congrats close to chef you I love you guys. I'll see you later. Adios. Congrats. Thank God. Bye. Well, what's really interesting?
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:10.200]   Chamath to your point about the CBA is they're gonna make these huge salaries
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.440]   They're not gonna give them the equity as part of
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.800]   their
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   Five-year deal they make the money
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   They then have the ability to invest in a team so you can be LeBron and you could be investing in the Knicks
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.040]   Maybe if somebody wanted to sell a percentage of it, you can invest in any NBA team
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.200]   Any sports betting team any sports betting?
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.400]   I actually think there's a simpler way to do this
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.400]   Which is it's it's I think it's fair to say that when you join a team
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:41.840]   It's like joining a company and you can create shadow equity and that shadow equity says you came in at this point
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:48.520]   Right you left at this point here was the Delta of the value and I think a good agent should be
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:54.000]   Negotiating on behalf of a player most players will not get that much a few basis points of that value
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.440]   Yeah, but the idea that a LeBron James can go to a Miami and double the franchise value double
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:04.880]   Yeah, right from you know, one or style it or Steph Steph steps a better
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:10.880]   Okay, great stuff comes in at 480 million and is now 5.3 billion. So that's a 10x thing plus of value
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.680]   You know is step responsible for 10 or 15 percent
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:20.240]   Should a billion dollars of that go to Steph Dre and clay. I think you can make a great claim that it could yeah
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.440]   Absolutely put them on the map. So yeah
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:28.080]   It would be and it would be pretty easy to do and what this might do is keep people on the same team longer
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.600]   Which is what fans want exactly why people moving around?
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:35.120]   That's a great point and private companies like Cargill or Koch Industries
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:41.120]   They have these shadow equity programs that they've had for years for decades that they've run on behalf of their employees
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   So we know how to run
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.160]   phantom
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:48.040]   phantom equity programs in private businesses and
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:54.080]   I just think the leadership of the NBA Players Association the NFL Players Association is
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.720]   Right now still lacking the sophistication
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:04.960]   To understand this well enough to then propose when the next time it is to to negotiate this kind of a deal
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.880]   But when you see things like this messy deal, I think it's a game changer
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:14.040]   It is a game changer and I think for sports, I don't know if you saw
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:19.080]   Adam Silver gave you know a little press conference with the finals and everything
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.440]   He was talking about the J. Murrah Moran situation with the guns
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.200]   It's just a lot of like topics coming up
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:29.760]   But one of the topics that was probably under appreciated was he was talking about the bundle the cable bundles going away
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:36.560]   And that people can't watch like the TNT a NBA on TNT, whatever that is with, you know, Charles Barkley, etc
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.720]   and
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.720]   He wants that to be available for free
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.840]   So he's gonna challenge people in the new TV deal
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.320]   If you want to have the NBA
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:48.680]   You have to have it available to every because the number of people who can see NBA games has been going down
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:55.560]   I have a question for you because you think more people do you think more people would pay for a subscription to watch the Knicks?
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.440]   games
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.760]   Wherever they happen to be all over the world or a subscription to watch Steph Curry
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:04.880]   No matter what team he plays on hmm, the old generations are loyal to the teams the new generations well to players
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:12.320]   So it's a generational miracle numerical question, which one's great. It's probably a jump ball right now, but it will eventually be they'll follow the players
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:19.400]   Because this new generation follows players like our kids like I don't think Ron from I've seen to take I think you could probably sell
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.360]   A few hundred thousand subscriptions to the Knicks and I think you'd sell mid millions for stuff
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:31.720]   What's gonna happen now is I think they're going to they just want this to be ad based and to directly subscribe
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:35.240]   So I directly subscribe to the NBA I get every game for $200 a year with no ads
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.880]   You know what? You know what we should do. I actually have a great idea
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:42.960]   What we should do is we go we should what live did to the PGA we should do to the NBA. Let's get together
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:51.600]   20 billion dollars. Let's start a competitive NBA League where we give the players all there is a structured phantom equity plan
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:57.080]   Pay these guys a hundred million bucks a year get all the big guys to come everybody else will come
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.160]   And just blow the whole thing wide open
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:04.640]   By the way, that's the blueprint now if you want to really compete with the with the NFL or the NBA or the NHL
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.440]   This is what you should do put together 20 or 30 billion, which is not that much money and
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.920]   Go for it
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.640]   You only need to get a couple of stars to blow it up
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.880]   And if you give stars the equity in the league, they'll convince all the other players to come
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:20.640]   I'll give let's give sacks some red meat here you sacks. I'll give you a little red meat. You want Tucker on Twitter
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:24.240]   There's your red meat choices as we wrap you want Tucker on Twitter?
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.920]   you want a
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.080]   Russian controlled dam being destroyed for a major flood or
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:35.880]   Do you want Chris Christie joining the race? Which red meat would you like?
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.680]   Which red meat we put in front of crazy hair
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:43.040]   Well, I mean what's happening Ukraine is really the big news this week. I mean
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:47.560]   offensive has well the Ukrainian counteroffensive has started in earnest and
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:51.720]   Yes in conjunction with that you're at the destruction of that major dam
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:56.400]   Which it's not clear who did it. I mean both sides are pointing the finger at each other
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.720]   so and there are
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:06.440]   Reasonable arguments for why either side may have done it in terms of who benefits it seems to benefit the Ukrainians more because
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:12.120]   the destruction of the dam washed out a bunch of Russian defensive fortifications and
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:16.480]   villages of Russian speakers on the other hand
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.080]   The Russians were in control of the dam
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:26.400]   So it would have been easier for them to carry it out if they had wanted to we just don't know but I think you
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:32.160]   Know events have now moved beyond that and we are now probably in the third or fourth day of the Ukrainian counteroffensive
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.480]   of course has not been officially declared, but there is
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.560]   major major fighting happening now where
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.800]   Ukrainian armored divisions are seeking to
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:46.000]   you know penetrate Russian defensive lines around Zaporizhzhia and
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.840]   So the long-awaited Ukrainian counteroffensive has certainly begun. How does the?
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   The dam relate to the Nord Stream pipeline because these are both situations where people are like who actually did it
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.600]   What's their motivation and let's face it. These are
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.520]   chaotic actors at times and
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:08.480]   Figuring out who has the motivation to do these things
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:16.200]   Seems like a leveling up kind of game because you can't put it past either party in some cases, but in the case of Nord Stream
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:21.680]   People saying hey, it was the Ukraine, but then there's this argument that the Ukraine's not capable of doing it
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.960]   Or maybe it was sanctioned by the US or the West and then executed by Ukraine
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.520]   But where do you wind up with all these so on Nord Stream?
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:36.360]   We're now on our third cover story the CIA sourcing their stenographers at the Washington Post have now claimed that it was six
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.560]   Ukrainian dudes in a yacht who blew up Nord Stream
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:45.560]   No, seriously, and if you look at this boat, I'll put a photo of the boat on the screen. It's it's pretty silly
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:51.040]   It's a 10 great. Yeah, the Ukrainians do not have a Navy and they certainly don't have Navy SEALs
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:57.560]   I don't believe they have the capability to by the way that this destruction of Nord Stream Nord Stream was this huge
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.280]   underwater steel and concrete
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.000]   Structure, it's not that deep though
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.920]   Cuz it's only a hundred fifty or two hundred feet deep at the lower points deep enough and it took a lot of explosives
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:15.320]   So they had to know what they were doing. So I dove 120 feet once so it's but the point is that when when Nord Stream
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.960]   was first destroyed
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:22.040]   The media rushed out to say well the Russians did it even though the Russians had no motive to do it
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.280]   It was their own is their pipeline. They could just turn it off if they wanted to
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:30.360]   But this is what we hear is that every time something destructive happens, it's the Russians did it
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.920]   Why would they attack themselves because they're so crazy?
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:39.320]   We heard this with Nord Stream when Belgorod which is a Russian district just across the border from Ukraine was attacked
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.480]   It was claimed that the Russians did it. These were Russian insurgents. No, that's pretty silly
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:50.480]   It was Ukrainians dressed in Russian uniforms and just recently when there were drone attacks on Moscow
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:55.720]   We were also told that oh, it wasn't Ukrainians who did it was Russian dissidents or something, which again makes no sense
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.360]   so this is not to say that
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.960]   The Russians didn't blow up that dam is just to say that
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.800]   Whenever the story is rushed out that the Russians did something highly destructive you have to
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:12.400]   We need to see some evidence here and we just don't know it's just hard to know the fog of war is thick
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.880]   All right. What did you think of Tucker's first?
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:22.200]   Show it's getting sued but he got the tweet got at least like 90 million views
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.480]   Which means the video probably got 10% of that or something
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:30.040]   So probably video yesterday was at 17 million views or something like that. So I'm sure it's more today
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:35.160]   So no, he's getting huge distribution through Twitter arguably. It's more distribution
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.280]   It's almost certainly more distribution than they got through Fox Fox was 3 million, right?
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.320]   Yeah, that's how many viewers he gets on Fox. Yeah. Well Fox is half of that now because they've
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.880]   They've attracted so much viewership after Tucker left
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:52.960]   But look the only thing that I think Tucker got through Fox was access to frankly a viewership base
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:59.520]   That's not very online. There are a lot of old people who watch Fox who just aren't on social media. That's it though
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:03.480]   Everybody else can see it on Twitter and he's getting more distribution on Twitter
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.600]   Super distribution is the way to go
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.680]   He's gonna get
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:15.960]   25 million people and of course monetizing it is the hard part because Fox is subscription revenue and everything else is
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.480]   He's creating a list, you know, he advertised the website Tucker Carlson calm at the end of his
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.120]   Video and you can go there and sign up for you subscribe direct and get it on his website
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.360]   I don't think he's monetizing it yet, but you can sign up for alerts and so forth
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.280]   So he's clearly creating a list of some kind. That's probably because he yeah with his
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.720]   Contract is still getting paid. And so he's like, yeah daily wire is the model
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:46.640]   I mean, they they have got well over a hundred million in revenue. I understand and they have a massive subscription business
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.080]   So there's a clear path there. All right. Hey listen for the
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.840]   world's greatest moderator
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.760]   living in the Bay Area David Friedberg and

[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.200]   Honestly have no idea what I'm doing here. I've I
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:42.240]   Have no idea who these people are or what this is or why you're all wearing white. I
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:47.800]   Mean seriously, I'm sure you're very nice people, but I have no idea what this is
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:54.880]   Have you seen the wicker man? Jake? I was like we're taping an episode in Napa and I'm like what on a you know off day
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:03.240]   Monday are you okay, buddy? Yeah, you low blood sugar. Yeah, actually I do bring us like a cheese plate or something
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.400]   Guacamole and chips
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:11.840]   Please but honestly like I didn't sign up for this. I thought we I
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:18.800]   Thought we disagreed to a podcast and somehow we've been roped into doing some dog and pony show for
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:25.040]   By the way, is that true these are a bunch of your LPS as well
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.040]   You just have never met them
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:31.920]   Literally, okay, I'll drink it. Yes. Yes, sir
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:38.040]   Literally, someone's like Jake out. I'm with this incredible endowment. We're incredibly successful. I'm like, oh, that's great. Yes, you heard
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:42.000]   I'm raising a fund. They're like no no, no, no. No, um, we heard sax is gonna be here
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.940]   I'm like, yeah, you want to meet him invest in front? Oh, no, we've invested in all his funds. We just never met him
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:50.120]   And so wow, that's one way
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.560]   Two things they've never seen sacks and a distribution
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:04.120]   Fucking decision, whoever you are. You're a real fucking genius back there
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:09.040]   Except for the fun we already paid back. Oh
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.640]   My god, I lost control of it in the first 90 seconds
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:19.400]   Why should tonight be any different except for the five-year-old fun? That's already fully returned
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.520]   So
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.800]   Welcome to the angel summit. These are my besties. We do a podcast called all in we thought we'd do it live
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.280]   this is the
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.440]   Fourth time we've ever appeared on stage together
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:39.000]   The first two times were at freeberg's LP conference in the Presidio. Yeah, I
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.800]   Resented that one, too
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:46.600]   Coming out to see humans
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.480]   Came out in his mask. He took his gloves off
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.600]   It was very uncomfortable for him, but he eased into a seat
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.960]   And then of course we did the all-in summit last year in Miami and
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.400]   This is the fourth time. So it's great to be out here
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.440]   We have a couple of news items on the docket
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:06.880]   We could start with or we can go right to Q&A with these many audience members who have a lot of questions
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.880]   What would you gentlemen like to do?
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.160]   Chamath has a few words. He'd like to say go ahead
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:16.000]   Chamath is drunk by the way, he texted us
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.800]   You can see that grin on his face. That's the Chamath grin. He gives when he decided
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:29.200]   That he would not have LPS and he would just invest his own money he does not care
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:36.640]   So it's the gloves are off. Let's do Q&A Jay Levy's is sacks. What's the path for DeSantis to win the nomination?
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.480]   And get the base of Trump Oh red meat. Oh good
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:47.840]   Here we go. I think the path basically is he has to win Iowa and or New Hampshire. It's just that simple
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:54.720]   But keep in mind that Trump did not win Iowa last or in 2016 Ted Cruz did
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.480]   Iowa tends to be more religious. I think Santas is trying to
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.800]   outflank Trump on the right actually on certain issues and
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:10.400]   So he's on the ground there campaigning. I for I understand he's generating a lot of interest and enthusiasm
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.320]   And he's gonna keep plugging away at it. I think he's gonna out hustle Trump
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:21.000]   I'm not saying he's gonna win but I think he's gonna work harder and the path would be that over the next
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:28.640]   What is it like nine months that Trump's style and message which is admittedly much more entertaining than DeSantis
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.320]   but kind of fatiguing whether that kind of gets old and
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:39.680]   DeSantis is more like disciplined messaging people just kind of wake up and say, you know what like I don't really want to go back to
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.680]   the chaos of
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.040]   the whole Trump show at this seems like
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.680]   better to me so
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:52.840]   That's basically what I think has to happen is Trump fatigue has to set in and people realize that there's a different
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.400]   Was that CNN Town Hall a sign that?
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:02.560]   Some group of people find him incredibly entertaining and the media themselves want him back because it's great for ratings
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.240]   I'll uh Mencken on session or
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.480]   Is it a sign that like my god, that's so fucking exhausting like you're saying sacks
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.040]   What do you think?
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:17.640]   I think that the the base like the town hall because it was Trump walking into the lion's den
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:23.400]   Standing up to the mainstream media, which is what they like, but I don't think it did anything to help him in the general
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.360]   because I think that
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.960]   viewers who
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:33.280]   Don't like Trump or aren't entertained by Trump. I mean, there's nothing there to really grab on to I don't think so
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.920]   But but look I think your point about who does the media want to get the Republican nomination?
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.200]   Definitely Trump because he's good for ratings
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.200]   And it really is that simple and they think they can beat him
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.480]   So right now the Biden people the Trump people and the media all
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:57.000]   want Trump over to Santas and that is why like to Santa's is getting dispatched by everybody right now is because
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.360]   You know, everyone's kind of aligned on this
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:05.720]   but the minute that Trump gets the nomination is all gonna turn the media all of a sudden is gonna turn on Trump and
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:10.920]   Then we're gonna see what the real campaign is gonna be a Santa's is in show business as they said on secession
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.960]   Was that the quote you show business? He's box office. He's not box. Yeah, just add this is a box office
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:22.480]   He's a somebody who actually can execute right, right, but also that's that's why he'd be a good move for Republicans
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.920]   I think is because he doesn't give the Democrats as much to work with. Yeah
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.160]   All right, entertaining, but he gives his enemies so much to work with. All right, another question from the back
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.440]   Go ahead stand up. Tell us your name. Yeah
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.160]   Sal Dacher from Boston and
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.320]   The question is much less exciting
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:48.600]   regarding sort of in the problem of bank bank runs and bank insurance by the Fed and
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.920]   bailing out, you know average people bailing out wealthy people I
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.640]   Have heard a lot of solutions about this I've been
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.280]   So careers and banking for a while
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:05.840]   the idea of having senior management and the board have direct liability
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:09.800]   If the feds have to step in to rescue the bank
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.080]   Do you think that that could be a step in the right direction in?
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:19.400]   Preventing banks from taking risks. They really shouldn't have taken I mean the 2008 disaster
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.760]   The subprime crisis could have been addressed with this
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.120]   I think this crisis with SVP could have been addressed with management just having a lot more to lose
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.400]   Okay, so let me just first take issue with the terminology of bailout
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:37.680]   I know that's what everyone calls it a bailout in my mind is when the shareholders of the bondholders of the bank get bailed out
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:45.680]   By taxpayers that happened in 2008. It did not happen here here. The question was whether depositors get made whole or not. I
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.200]   Personally don't consider that a bailout
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:54.360]   I understand that there are people who do but it is a slightly different issue as to the bank management, you know
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.720]   You're talking about like a strict liability standard here that
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:05.960]   I mean basically you're talking about piercing the corporate veil and making the bank executives and their
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.480]   directors liable for
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.120]   mismanagement of the bank and
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.840]   That is that's a pretty high bar
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.520]   That's a really high bar and the problem with it is that I would never serve on the board of a bank
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.120]   I mean, I probably wouldn't anyway, but if you told me that I could be
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.840]   liable piercing the bow
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:27.000]   Right, we have a thing called the business judgment rule, you know in
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.480]   Delaware where if directors and officers of the company perform
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:39.240]   Their job in a good faith way making the best decisions they can and it goes wrong
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.560]   They're not typically liable for that. Maybe the corporation's liable if they're not personally liable
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.080]   I'd look if you did that
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.560]   the managers wouldn't invest the cash in anything because they wouldn't want to take any risk of loss and
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:57.080]   In order to operate the business which has a bunch of people working there and a bunch of banks that they got to operate
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.720]   They're gonna charge you a fee to hold your money for you
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.840]   And so what happens is interest rates turn negative and you basically have to pay someone to hold your money for you
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.080]   And that's what's a little bit messed up about the way the banking system works today
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:12.200]   Is you're effectively giving a money manager the right to invest your money for you. They take your money
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:17.120]   they pay you a low interest rate may go invested in high interest rate stuff by taking on risk with your capital and
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.560]   Ultimately, they can take losses on that and if you want it to make them liable for those losses
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:27.240]   They're not going to take that risk and the bank is gonna have to change its business model from being an arbitrage business
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.480]   To being a service fee business and they're gonna have to figure out other ways to charge you service fees
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:36.720]   Including charging you to hold your money in order to make money and that's what a lot of the banks are now doing first
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:42.080]   Republic and others have now proclaimed that they're gonna start charging a lot more service fees to hold your money and they're gonna start taking
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.440]   A lot less risk, so we're already headed in that direction
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:48.720]   But that's fundamentally what I think would let's take another question from the audience
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.600]   Good evening. I'm Lisa song Sutton, Las Vegas, Nevada
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:58.000]   I'm GP in the veteran fund as investors you all invest in entrepreneurs
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:04.480]   Theoretically support American entrepreneurship. What role if any do you think VCS should have in?
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.360]   shaping advocating supporting conservative economic policy in the country
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.600]   Shemot
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.600]   zero
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:19.560]   I think that we have to know the role that you're doing if you're a venture investor
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.440]   which is you're buying a deep out of the money option and
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:28.280]   I think that you want to motivate the people that you are partnering with
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.040]   to take really thoughtful but outsized risks and
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.720]   So I don't think there's a lot of room for
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.200]   Conservativism I do think that there's room for
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:46.520]   misallocation of capital and I think that there's people that can help guide that but the reality is that when you start a company
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:53.120]   it's 95% likely to fail and the venture investor is signing up for a
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.520]   70 or 80 percent
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.680]   Probability that they lose capital
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:03.080]   Maybe a 10 or 15 or 20 percent chance that they get their money back and then the small
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.560]   5 percent chance that it becomes reasonable
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.480]   so
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.440]   In that lens, I don't think that's where
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.440]   conservative economic policies really should play a role I
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.600]   Think you just kind of got to go for it
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.520]   And if it's gonna win it's gonna win big and if it doesn't you lose one extra money
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:30.640]   I think like where you want conservative economic and rational thinking is when you go to the extreme other end
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:37.760]   which is just like the large-scale decisions that affect the economic vibrancy of the country in which you live and
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:43.520]   They're on the margins. You probably want to be more rational than unrational irrational, but as a venture investor
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.120]   I think you want to be irrational, but I also think you have to be very judgmental and
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.520]   The reality is that most companies aren't gonna work and most people
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:57.000]   This may seem countervert controversial most people
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:03.080]   Actually when push comes to shove are a little afraid of the decisions they need to make to be truly successful
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.560]   They're not willing to fire the people that they need to fire
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.120]   They're not willing to be extreme in the product. They want to build they're not willing to price it
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.520]   they're not willing to go to market in an extreme way and
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:19.120]   It tends to be that these companies fail because of that a lack of courage a lack of conviction
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.680]   It's a lack of courage or conviction because that that's a very heightened word
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:28.040]   I just think that when push comes to shove most people implode with the pressure of making a very very hard decision
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.160]   Hmm interesting. All right in my experience. It could be yours could be no, I mean, I
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.400]   Agree with you largely when a startup does fail
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.640]   If the experience people around it are watching and can't get through to the founder of the founding team
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:47.720]   It's typically they are blocking their own success. They're unwilling to fire their co-founder
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.080]   their CTO as the example you're alluding to perhaps or raise the price of the software and lose some customers or
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:59.760]   To drive people to work harder because you've got a competitor in the space and that's why you see extreme people win in
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.240]   Our pursuit and I think there's been just a great fallacy that's gone on
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.800]   That you can have live work balance or life work balance and you could have this
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.300]   Nirvana where you have it all the fact is the great companies are made by people who make great
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:17.960]   Sacrifices period full stop and if you're not willing to make the great sacrifice, you're not gonna have great outcomes
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.560]   Hi, David Samuel earlier today Jason you had kind of a doomsday or AI
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:30.280]   Panelist and my question is you guys have been thrust into the public spotlight and we look at deep fakes in the next year
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.980]   Or two as you talk about, you know tweeting on Friday versus Wednesday
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:40.000]   how do you think about somebody having each of you saying things that you did not say and
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:48.480]   Like how might we know whether Chamath said that or it was a deep fake saying it. I already have that problem. Yeah
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.240]   Insider last week where somebody was saying I had a phone call. I never had so how do we solve this?
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.840]   Especially for you as well as public two things two things one
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:04.040]   I don't think people can say more outlandish and damaging things in AI than we say ourselves
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:11.480]   On this podcast at times but number two, you know as we've discussed many times on this podcast
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.040]   We have rebooted our trust
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.800]   in
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:22.440]   Institutions what we read what we say and I think people are now assuming they're being manipulated
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:28.960]   Assuming something might be fake news or doctored and I think it's like people are building up a much higher
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:34.240]   resiliency to bullshit lies manipulation and if I were to ask a hundred people
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.720]   What is the bias of CNN New York Times Fox MSNBC NPR?
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:47.800]   90 out of 100 Americans could describe it almost exactly people are not dumb. This is another fallacy
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.520]   I think we have in this country is that people are dumb and they're gonna get suckered
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:56.800]   People are kind of figuring it out and we've seen deep fakes for what five years ten years now and they're like, yeah
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:02.520]   You know Luke Skywalker didn't look really good in The Mandalorian, but there's a kid who redid it and now Dolly too is doing it
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:06.240]   I think we're kind of inoculating ourself to what do you think free bird?
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:13.440]   Deep fakes and truth when the Gutenberg press was invented a bunch of fake shit was
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.000]   Printed and people believed it. I don't think
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:24.200]   the current iteration with deep deep fakes is very different from any form of
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:29.160]   Mass media being used to tell people on truth. I'm just called a crusades. What's that?
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:33.000]   Oh the Crusades. Yeah. No, I mean but look I mean
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:37.920]   You're a hundred percent, right? I don't want to speak about religion negatively in that way. It is one of many
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.400]   institutions of power that leveraged mass media
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.880]   historically
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:50.560]   To get people to believe things to do things and to ultimately be able to tax people and get them to provide capital and labor
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.320]   in the interest of those who are in power and
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:58.040]   the the system of deep faking is one of a
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.520]   long string of using the current toolkit
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.320]   To take mass media and and follow that same track
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:11.840]   So it will be dealt with in the same way that things have been dealt with that have been fake news in the past
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:17.480]   Which is that there will be an opposing voice and there will be counter arguments and there will be debates and it will be
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.760]   rancorous and it will be noisy and it will be hard to discern and
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:27.440]   Alternatives will emerge and tools that identify deep fakes will emerge and it will be the same ongoing battle and seeking of the truth
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.260]   That humanity has tried to do
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.480]   Since the dawn of mass media, you know
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.440]   Yesterday's conspiracy theories are like tomorrow's Pulitzer prizes
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.920]   I always say like if you look at
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:44.800]   Shania O'Connor ripping up the Pope's picture on Saturday Night Live right in protest and saying like the this is the true enemy
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:51.960]   They're molesting children and then the Boston Globe and the movie spotlight is about them a decades later
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:56.800]   Winning a Pulitzer for uncovering what anybody who's in the room?
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:02.120]   Who's Catholic in the 70s and 80s knew or had heard was going on and so, you know
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.360]   Maybe the time frame is shortening between when we're being lied to and when we figure it out
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:11.840]   I actually think it's interesting and good because it forces us to find ways to find the truth more effectively and
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:19.680]   You know it kind of without the antagonism. I think it's you know, it's it's absent. What is the truth?
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.200]   You don't you don't force that debate. You don't force that question and this will
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:31.880]   Start to reveal ways that we can kind of find things that are actual evidentiary things versus things that someone told me with either
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:37.520]   Historically anecdote or innuendo or I'm a person in power where I'm an authority or I'm an expert and nowadays
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.640]   It's like I'm a piece of media. You should believe me or here
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.840]   I'm an image of a person and that's not gonna be the case anymore. Hi, I'm Jeff
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:49.560]   full-time corporate VC and part-time angel my questions about AI and higher education
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:54.720]   And it's actually some covert parenting advice so you can decide who's that's relevant for
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.280]   My son just finished his freshman year of college and I'm questioning
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:04.640]   What the future is for him in higher education given all the change that AI is going to
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:09.000]   Gonna have on on every career in every profession
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.440]   And I'm wondering what advice you'd give to to your child or or someone who's in college right now for what?
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:22.560]   what's an area of study that won't maybe won't be disrupted by by AI or or an area that
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.140]   AI you'll get leverage from your education
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:32.680]   Through AI. I think the reality is that most of the existing jobs that we have in the United States
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:41.860]   Are going to go to lower cost locations that have that tool chain to accelerate their capability
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.000]   So
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.800]   we're gonna have to reinvent the workforce and
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.920]   The things that we do
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:54.440]   Over the next 30 or 40 years to stay relevant
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:59.160]   That's probably like I think that should just be the operating principle
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.920]   If you think about it, we used to run great call centers
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:08.760]   Okay, those call centers were outsourced to the Philippines in India, but in the next, you know, five or ten years
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.440]   You'll have this flawless
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.600]   unaccented English or even more
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.000]   eerily
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.720]   perfectly accented English
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:21.920]   For the zip code of the person that's calling in so that it sounds like they're talking to somebody that's literally their neighbor
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.840]   That's like just makes so much sense, right?
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:28.920]   So it's like all this stuff is gonna happen where like all these classes of jobs are gonna go away
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:35.280]   I saw this article where a lawyer two lawyers use chat GPT to submit a legal brief
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:40.320]   The problem was that it cited cases that didn't exist and now they're gonna be disbarred
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:46.600]   So this is like serious business right like you can't do that. Like that's like real legal
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:51.880]   Malfeasance, so what are your kids not practice in college?
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:57.160]   You know if I had to choose something for my kids I would probably I
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.040]   Would probably tell them to do something
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.200]   mathematical or biological
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:09.120]   The reason I would point them to math is that I think that it's irrefutable. There's this great clip between
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:15.920]   Ricky Gervais and Stephen Colbert. You guys should go and Google this but it's a clip where he's on the Colbert show and
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:22.840]   Colbert is a deeply devout Catholic and he's offended by the fact that Ricky Gervais doesn't believe in God and
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:28.560]   He asked him why don't you believe in God and Ricky Gervais says look if we wiped out all the books in the world
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:34.000]   In a thousand years everything that's scientific and mathematical would be reestablished
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.480]   But everything that is religious or theoretically not, you know mythical if you want to say
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.440]   Would look very very different
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.480]   And that's why I don't believe in God
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:49.080]   I'm not trying to question that but it's a way of answering this question
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.240]   Which is I would try to point my children to the body of knowledge
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.120]   That's largely irrefutable
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:01.000]   Which is biological and mathematical versus belief oriented because I think these tools will change one's beliefs
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.520]   I've been thinking about this a lot too. I think teaching them to be entrepreneurial
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:12.560]   Resilient worldly ability to communicate ability to lead other people in teams. That stuff's not going to go away
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.240]   communication skill, etc, and
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:20.420]   I'm encouraging everybody who I work with to just use chat GPT for and
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:26.960]   Barred every day for every single thing that they do my base thesis right now. Is that
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.040]   the job
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.760]   Freezes the hiring freezes that all these companies is indefinite
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:38.200]   I'm assuming it's indefinite because the amount of work it takes to write a job requisition is
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:43.200]   more work in some cases than actually automating with
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:49.480]   AI or ready the job function and so I think 20 person companies might you know
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.860]   Double in size in the next two or three years
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.960]   But still have 20 people
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:59.200]   It's gonna be a big challenge for the for society and if it if that does come to pass
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:05.000]   There's just gonna be large swaths of people who are not going to be able to get job interviews for anything other than service jobs
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.160]   And you know, we need a lot more plumbers electricians waiters
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:13.720]   Etc. Those probably jobs won't go away. Especially if we don't let people immigrate. So I
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:17.120]   am super enthusiastic about that efficiency
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:22.240]   But I think it also means you have to be entrepreneurial because if you can't get a job and you can't get mentored
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.400]   You better create your own opportunity. You better create your own company and
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:31.280]   That's what I'm seeing. That's the game on the field right now two or three people who don't have job offers from uber and Airbnb
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.160]   And Google and Facebook just saying fuck it
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:38.960]   Let's start a company because there's nothing else for us to do and those are highly skilled people right now doing that
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.120]   I'll say two quick things about this topic. So
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:47.120]   One is I think there's a lot of AI fear porn out there right now, and I just think that like all these
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:52.880]   Doomer scenarios are they're not gonna play out overnight. I mean, this is gonna take a while
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.280]   Second
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   If you think about like job elimination, it's gonna be some super specialized jobs. So for example, I
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:07.520]   Wouldn't want to be a radiologist right now, but doctors will be fine
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:13.520]   So I think if you're thinking about like going into a job category, that's super
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:20.960]   specialized and clearly in the way of AI then that probably is not a good idea, but
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:28.880]   Most general skills like you're talking about and most job categories are gonna be fine. There's just gonna be some
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.600]   specialties within them that may get
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:36.640]   Dislocated like I wouldn't want to be a truck driver either, you know because of self-driving
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:44.280]   But transportation companies are still gonna exist. So I think you just want to be careful about super specialization
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.400]   I think but building general skills is always really good. That really should be the point of college
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:55.280]   Where would you put lawyers and accountants on that? I'm curious. They're sufficiently general that I don't think they're gonna be eliminated
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:58.800]   But will they be able to do five times the amount of work therefore we won't need as many
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.760]   They may be able to get more done. Yeah, I would expect them to get more done
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.880]   Yeah, but I don't think necessarily think that means we'll need less of them
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:12.440]   I mean the old story about lawyers is that there was one lawyer in a town had no business
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:16.080]   Second lawyer came to town and they were both more busy than they knew what to do with
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.600]   So, you know
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:26.240]   Lawyers get 30% more productive. They file 30% more lawsuits and you know, we're good. Yeah, let's take another question
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.320]   These are great questions so far. Hey guys, Rick Spencer. I hope Chamath gets to choose the wine this evening for dinner
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.760]   I did not get to choose your wine. So I apologize in advance
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:40.120]   What kind of water would you get? This is the list of 2018 Chateau Conlefon, Brazil
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:43.160]   Oh, that's I love the bestie. Okay question
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:49.200]   So you've talked recently in episodes about the speed of AI the adoption and how the winners are still unknown
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:52.720]   That was reinforced in the sessions today a room full of investors
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:58.020]   How are you thinking differently about your investment, you know your strategic investment decisions and your strategy?
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:04.400]   Are there opportunities to look at venture investing differently like venture studios, you know in the future of AI?
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.440]   I had this conversation earlier today. I think I started a company in 2006
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:11.760]   Where we took large data sets
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.000]   and
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.280]   We built predictive models from those data sets and we use those predictive models to make analytical tools available
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:21.680]   to a specific vertical in our case agriculture farmers and
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.480]   the models were both
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:27.080]   Deterministic meaning there was kind of
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:33.560]   definitions algorithmic definitions of physical parameters and there was like all the statistical inference that you get from large data sets and
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.680]   It made recommendations for farmers
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:45.680]   What a lot of people are calling AI today is fundamentally a predictive model on text on language
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:50.120]   I am making a language predictor that gives you a sentence
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.840]   and it seems so profound because it is how we all interact with computers and interact with one another and
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:02.440]   As a result it is kind of viewed as this sea change across all of these industries instantaneously
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.760]   It's this whole new era
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.840]   But the fact is that
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:12.360]   Generally speaking the digitization of things and the amount of data that's being generated on earth is going up by some order of magnitude
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.880]   every number of months and
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:22.560]   Our ability to make predictions and build predictive models that are useful to specific vertical segments is improving every sequential cycle
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:29.480]   That this is happening across every vertical and it is continued and it hasn't changed and it's not any different
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.160]   So there's in this area of genomics and bioinformatics
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:37.120]   There is an absolute sea change happening in human health in synthetic biology
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:42.800]   And our ability to understand and predict the biological world and make changes and create new drugs
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:49.400]   Create new systems for producing molecules for producing things that humans consume and it is all buoyed by
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:55.040]   machine learning applied to large data sets and genomics and other metadata associated with human health and
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:01.080]   Biology and we're seeing the same thing in other areas whether it's chemistry material science
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:09.840]   Industrial application consumer markets and so on the era of what people are now calling AI is an interface layer of language
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.040]   That's really creating
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:18.200]   transformational opportunities on how these tools how these systems how these models can be utilized and provided to all these different verticals and allows us to
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.680]   rethink business models to rethink interaction models and
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:28.640]   To really change the economics of different businesses and the utility and the productivity of humans because it is about speech
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:35.400]   It is about communication is about what we fundamentally do as a species. So I would argue that the general
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:44.080]   Trajectory of machine learning the general trajectory of data generation our ability to make predictions generate value across all these different markets is
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:50.480]   Continuing in the way that it has been continuing for the last 20 years and it is profound in its own, right?
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:55.440]   and I wouldn't say that there's a massive sea change in that evolution because of
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:30:00.040]   Large language models large language models create another set of opportunities
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:04.080]   So I would kind of create a distinction and make sure that the categorization of the investment
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:09.440]   Opportunities in large language models be assessed on its own and everyone's all over the place as you guys probably heard today
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:16.440]   Foundational models are getting disrupted every other week. They're being decreased in size parameters are being reduced. They're being commoditized
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:21.080]   You can run these things on m2 chips. Everything is up in the air right now, and it's friggin nuts
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:24.480]   You're gonna invest in a company at a 500 million dollar valuation and six weeks later
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:28.920]   It's gonna be worth zero because someone open source the exact same thing that you can now do for 100k
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:33.720]   So that's very difficult and very different then but there are still like these
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:40.480]   Incredible points of inflection happening across all these other industries with respect to machine learning and that's where I spend my time
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:45.440]   Chamathi want to add what you're looking at. I think this is gonna be the big question. Yeah six or seven years ago
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:53.000]   There was a Google earnings release where they talked about building their own silicon. I've told this story before but I
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:57.720]   Ping those guys and I was basically like I just want to meet the team that built the TPU
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:01.240]   long story short a year later, I put them in business and
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:07.440]   You know, we've been building silicon for this moment for years. It's been really really hard
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:14.040]   And the reason it's been really really hard is that Nvidia is just really really good
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:17.400]   CUDA is very very complete
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:22.920]   And it's just very difficult to justify why one would build
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.240]   Once you have something that you think is profound
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:31.760]   Through you know implement multiple SDKs to like multiple points of silicon just doesn't make any sense
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:38.200]   That being said I still think you need to be at the absolute bottom of the stack and the absolute top of the stack
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:41.400]   I think I'm a little too biased for saying the former
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:46.600]   Which is I'm hoping that there's vendor diversity in silicon diversity
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.160]   Because I think it's going to be really important
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.840]   I don't think we want to have a world where Nvidia runs away with it. So I think there's
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:56.680]   Investment opportunity there just because I think everybody should want that to happen
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.640]   And then at the absolute top
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:02.440]   Freeberg's right that
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.960]   All these
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:08.200]   Foundational models I think are changing so rapidly that the thing that you want to figure out is like
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:13.000]   What are you seeding it with to drive learning that's unique and that's a data problem
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.080]   So there's an example that I've given this was a an example given to me
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:21.960]   By Nick Cash Aurora, so it's not I'm not going to take credit for it
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.280]   He's the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, but he was telling me
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:26.840]   You know when you look at
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.840]   travel
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:31.640]   The travel space all the public travel companies are like
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.600]   300 billion dollars of public market cap Expedia Travelocity all these companies
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:39.400]   but they're pure middlemen
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:45.560]   And they sit on top of the data feed that comes from a handful of companies one of them is Sabre
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   And so I went in I looked at Sabre Sabre is like a 1.3 billion dollar company a small little company
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.840]   But they are the ones that go into all the airlines extract all this gobbledygook data
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.240]   normalize it and allow
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.800]   Expedia Travelocity booking.com to exist
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:07.080]   in a world of machine learning where
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:13.080]   An ai where theoretically you can have conversational languages in inside of whatsapp or messenger or instagram
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.600]   You see this beautiful picture. You're like book me a ticket to that place
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.840]   well
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.840]   Sabre is actually the key
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:24.360]   Value creator there
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:31.320]   And all these Expedia examples that are plugins at gbt make no sense. They make no economic sense. Those companies should go to zero
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:33.320]   so
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:39.160]   I've used that as a way a forcing function for me to try to prove that there's really these two barbells
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:43.800]   It's a barbell bookends one is a silicon and one of these sort of like data providers
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.860]   That's probably an investable thing. That's defensible
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:51.400]   Everything in the middle. I think what what freebrook said is true, which is today
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.200]   It looks like it's worth a couple billion dollars tomorrow's worth nothing
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:57.320]   And so I think you have to be very careful if you listen to
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:01.880]   There's an interview that steven wolfram did with lex friedman if you guys listened to it
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:06.680]   A few weeks ago. I had him on my pod a couple weeks ago, but haven't heard the free. Yeah, he's incredible
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.560]   Yeah, he's incredible
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:13.640]   If you listen to that interview, I think wolfram does a great job of describing the difference between inferential models or statistical models
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.360]   and computational models
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:20.440]   Statistical models are where you take large data sets and you build
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.380]   statistical models that infer
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:27.320]   And predict things in the future or predict things that you ask it to predict
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:31.640]   From the data set that it's trained on and then it creates a statistical representation
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:37.000]   It has a probability of being right or wrong and every prediction it makes and it creates a distribution of outputs from the model
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.120]   And you can train a model from nothing today
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:46.280]   Using a bunch of tools that are open source and generally available and a bunch of great silicon and all this amazing stuff
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.280]   That's that's that's now out in the world
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.680]   But there's a bunch of things that you can't
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:58.600]   Generate data and you can't necessarily train models on and that requires computational models models where you actually have to build some
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.240]   System
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:06.040]   That creates a deterministic outcome and deterministic means that it doesn't have a distribution of things that could happen
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:10.760]   It has one thing and it calculates it like two plus four is six
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:16.840]   There isn't a probability distribution on it being six two plus four is computable. It is calculable. It is six
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:20.200]   the great unlock
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:27.000]   That I think is ahead of us still generally speaking with respect to large language models is the connection back
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:34.520]   To computational models is the connection back to structured data where you can make requests and integrate structured data into the output
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.920]   combined with inferential output
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:44.120]   And computational models where you can take the inference you can take the request and figure out what computational models
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:47.480]   Can I now run in addition to making a prediction about an output?
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:54.040]   And that's where so much of the value is going to lie and it's going to require incredible software engineering talent
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:59.000]   Applied math statistics all the stuff that's made data science generally speaking
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:04.520]   So successful over the last two decades is going to continue and it's going to be this integration between
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.440]   computation
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:10.680]   And inference, um, and it's going to be applied in lots of different markets and it's going to be really powerful
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.840]   And we're all going to have our minds blown
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:16.840]   Just in terms of like the seed stage or super early pre-seed stage
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:21.560]   Two or three people who are obsessed with this technology who are playing with it every day
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.040]   Who are keeping up to speed on it?
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:28.840]   And who understand some customer base whether it's delighting themselves or delighting some other customer base
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:32.440]   I'm willing to take that small bet on that 100k to 250k bet
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:41.080]   Because in the previous paradigm shifts or platform shifts cloud computing apps and before that desktop computing
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.160]   and the web
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:48.620]   You saw people start tinkering with stuff and whatever their first two ideas were are long forgotten
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:52.840]   Because they figured something else out and I kind of feel like that's the stage we're in
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.960]   There were a lot of people who were playing with iPhones in the app store
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:01.800]   and you know, they made a calculator or a flashlight that got built into the operating system as um,
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:07.000]   I think freeberg is specifically pointing out like you could just be part of the model and your whole business is wiped out
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.120]   We have one company that's trying to make itineraries for travel
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:16.600]   And I looked at what they're building and then you know, they're figuring out prompts. They're figuring out the interface
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.680]   They're figuring out what people want
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:23.560]   And I did the same searches on chat gbd4 and I was like, it's not that much better what you're doing
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:29.160]   But it's better and your ideas are better. And so I think that they'll win the race and they only have to please
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.560]   You know, whatever number of users
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:36.600]   And this company could wind up being like I said before a 20 person company that does 50 million in revenue
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:41.560]   And I think that's going to be a very interesting future and it reminds me of the app economy
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.680]   There were a small number of acts things like distro kid
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.920]   or instagram
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:51.240]   Where small teams built things that printed money and had incredibly high margins
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:56.040]   So I think that's part of the opportunity here. I do agree with chamath's point data is the new oil
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:01.660]   Whatever data set you have that you have that's unique is incredibly powerful in terms of defensibility
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:05.320]   And could help you to outpace one of the generic models
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:12.600]   This dude's been waiting, okay, dude, he's been waiting. All right lightning round. Thanks david for the mic
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.000]   My name is raed must you transform vc in san francisco my questions for you chamath
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.880]   um in the last finally jesus christ
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.880]   something else
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.960]   What the fuck these guys
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:28.680]   So on the last one or two episodes I can't recall you um
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:32.060]   You brought up this whole idea is how do we get non-us-born?
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:35.560]   American patriots to run for president
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:38.280]   so, uh as the
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.840]   growth hacking drunken master
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.480]   Um, what do you recommend? How do we propel this idea? How do we have it pick up steam?
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:51.400]   And not have to wait 25 years or whatever, you know, it can't happen in the next few years
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.960]   I think I do think there's a small probability could happen in
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.600]   25 to 30 years, but
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:59.640]   Like the problem is that
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:02.520]   The people that
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.440]   Only j cal can be president on the stage. Yeah, the three of us are fucked up
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:12.520]   This is but i'll put you guys in my cabinet. You've all got positions. I think the how is that you have
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:16.060]   Enough bottoms up citizen journalism
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:19.160]   and opinion formation
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:24.600]   That people can independently decide that on the margin. This is a good idea
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:28.120]   Like look, I i'm not interested in running for government
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:33.400]   But if david were in charge of something very important treasury or state I would have
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:41.000]   Immense confidence if freeberg were in charge of something I would have immense confidence. So the idea that guys like this
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]   (laughter)
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.600]   The idea that guys like this and and oh because i'm born here so you don't have to say that
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:53.800]   Don't worry, you'll get the department of sanitation work. I'm definitely gonna win. No, so for sure. I'm gonna win
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:56.520]   postmaster general
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:00.280]   I do think it's a little it's a little crazy that
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:06.920]   Guys like these two get disqualified just because they emigrated when they were like four and six
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.960]   That's insane
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:15.240]   So I I think that if we're in the business of actually deciding that you want the best people for this country
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.240]   on the court
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.240]   So that we keep winning championships
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:26.280]   You don't tell janice. Oh, you know, you were born in greece. So ciao. Ciao, you don't get to play that's crazy
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:29.240]   Put them on the court
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:32.600]   And let them win so I do think it takes 25 or 30 years though
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:36.440]   of us saying this because it has to be a groundswell of people that say
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:40.280]   I just want to win because i'm seeing all these other countries starting to win more
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:44.200]   And I don't think I want that for my children. I think I did. I do think it takes a generation
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.800]   I don't think it happens today
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:48.760]   All right, guys in a couple of hours. It will be
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:54.120]   The sultan of science's birthday and alan keating's and alan keating's
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:56.680]   And yeah, that's right
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:59.480]   So I thought it would only be fitting
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.320]   if
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.440]   a hundred
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:07.240]   All in super fans took a moment. I'm gonna sing in italian and sung
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:11.320]   Happy birthday to dave freeberg three
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.480]   two
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:15.480]   one
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:27.340]   Happy birthday dear free bird
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:32.140]   Happy birthday to you
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:35.260]   and many more
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:37.420]   All right, sultan of science
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:45.260]   I know your wish was to be a top 10 podcaster. It's come true. Finally. I'm like I gotta go into podcasting. Yes
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:51.820]   Thank you ashley
[01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:56.720]   Will let your winners ride rain man david sax
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:03.520]   We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:14.700]   Besties are gone
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:17.660]   My dog taking a notice in your driveway
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:26.780]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:29.900]   It's like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release them out
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:33.180]   What you're about to be
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:36.140]   Pure feet
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:38.460]   We need to get mercies
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:47.820]   I'm going all in
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:49.880]   you
