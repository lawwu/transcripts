[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about a Nobel Prize in economics
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.200]   Gunning for that one and also how to have a risk-appropriate asset allocation when investing
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.540]   so recently I wrote a post called how to enjoy your life after the Fed ruins the world and
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.920]   The thesis was well rich central bankers are rich Jerome Powell Fed share is worth over a hundred million dollars
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.180]   They were able to sell stocks at the top of the market in 2022
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.400]   And so no matter how much they tighten they will be okay because they got out they were cleared of any
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.160]   supposedly wrongdoing insider trading and front-running
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.200]   however recently you saw Atlanta Fed
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.480]   Rafael Bostic break rules break Fed trading rules
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.440]   He said that he was unaware that he wasn't allowed to trade this and that whatever the case may be
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.200]   There's just a different set of rules
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.360]   It seems for Fed governors and information they know about and the rest of us
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.760]   so the point of the post was to just
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.060]   Encourage people to accept reality that there are two sets of rules for different types of people and to accept the reality
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.000]   We are in a bear market and to try to enjoy life more. That was really it
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.960]   How do we enjoy life more when the global economy is heading into a recession into a deeper recession?
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.520]   This was a classic case of trying to make lemonade out of lemons and I've always thought this way
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.360]   For example when I sprained my ankle my immediate thought is hmm. Thank God. I didn't break my ankle
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.800]   What are the things that I can do now that I'm immobile for one or two weeks, right?
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.080]   Maybe I can write maybe I can soak in the hot tub. Maybe I can record more podcast. That's a pretty good idea
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.880]   Hmm bear market time. What are the things we can do more of now that making money is harder
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.360]   The return on effort is harder. Well, I talked about maybe you don't want to be
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.600]   99% in your job anymore because you're probably not gonna get that raise and promotion that you want instead of being a 99%
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.520]   Maybe just be a 40 to 60 percent or like right in the middle
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.680]   Because the folks at the bottom 10% are likely going to get cut
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.640]   So if you can just hover in the middle, it's a better alignment of reward and effort
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.520]   You know if you're a 40 to 60 percenter, that's the average person you're in the middle of the bell curve
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.640]   But then a lot of commenters got really hot and bothered by that
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.060]   Suggestion of just doing the middle because I assume most of you listeners and readers are top performers
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.320]   You care about your finances you're listening and reading financial samurai. You're trying to optimize your time and your money wisely
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.440]   But there comes a point where you know, no matter how much you try you're not gonna get that reward that you expect
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.640]   Therefore you have to align your efforts more appropriately. Otherwise, you're gonna get bitter
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.160]   Annoyed pissed off. So because the post how to enjoy your life after the Fed ruins
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.040]   The world was picked up by flipboard this reading app over
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.420]   10,000 new readers who are unfamiliar with financial samurai or my background or my work ethic
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.440]   Ran my post and a lot of them commented and there were a lot of very angry and emotionally charged
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.120]   Comments and a lot of people talked about politics. Whereas the post is not political at all. The Fed is not political
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.720]   This is money. This is life, but based on the feedback because comments are a reflection of how you feel I
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.040]   realized there is a lot of fear out there at the moment the fear of losing a lot more money in the stock market and
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.080]   The fear of your political party not winning the midterm elections and if you think about it happy people don't go on
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.640]   Random sites and write nasty comments and start getting into fights over social media about stupid things, right?
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.160]   Happy normal people just kind of live their lives do what they want
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.480]   but as a writer of financial samurai
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.400]   I have the privilege of reading comments and you have the privilege of
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:14.120]   reading my post that reflect how I'm feeling and what I realized from all the comments and on the feedback is that
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.240]   Emotion emotion plays a huge role in living a good life and in investing if you're overly
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.640]   Emotional during bull markets you got to be aware because you might be investing
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:34.200]   Too much and you're depending too much for those returns and when the downturn inevitably comes you're gonna feel that trough of sorrow that deep
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.960]   Kind of pain and emptiness which I actually felt after grinding so hard for two years writing by this not that and then once it
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.520]   Was out and made the bestseller. I was like, man, that's it and I started thinking well, what's next?
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.680]   What else can I spend the next two years of my life on? Of course, you know parenthood taking care of my family
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.000]   Writing on financial samurai recording these podcasts, but you started thinking about you know
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.440]   The future a lot once you have this kind of letdown and you have time to think conversely
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.120]   You might have an inappropriate asset allocation if you find yourself losing
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.280]   Patience with your spouse and kids who have nothing to do with your investment choices when stocks are going down
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.600]   It's pretty clear sign that you know
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.960]   You're bringing your emotions from something irrelevant to people that you care about the most and that's really sad
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.440]   If you find yourself binge eating and gaining weight or drinking heavily during a bear market
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:39.640]   Your asset allocation to stocks or any other risk investments is probably too high and the same thing goes for feeling
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.760]   Let's say chronic back pain or any kind of chronic pain you have
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.160]   Our bodies provide great warning signs if you pay attention
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.080]   One of the key things I realized after working in finance for 13 years is that chronic pain is unusual?
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.200]   About six months after I left finance a lot of my pain went away my chronic back pain my sciatica
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.280]   my TMJ and
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.860]   That was when I realized man for 13 years. I was just putting up with this chronic pain and now
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.760]   95% of it is gone and it's been gone for over 10 years now
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.720]   So if you are feeling bad, there's something up some random injury
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.040]   Maybe it's a neck crick that goes down to your back and you know, you just suddenly can't move something inexplicable
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.040]   That wasn't caused by something specific
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:36.120]   There's probably a little bit more stress in your life than your body would like and you've got to go deep down and think about
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.840]   Things list those things that are stressing you out
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.360]   Tell your body look I understand. These are the things that are stressing me out. They're pissing me off
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.260]   It'll be okay and you work systematically to try to reduce those items
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.960]   Take them off your plate for your own health and safety and longevity the bottom line way, you know
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:03.360]   How you are investing appropriately in a bull market or bear market is when you don't let your emotions overwhelm you
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:11.800]   Don't let them go beyond the normal emotional range band that you have. Yes feel the sting of losing money in a bear market
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.000]   It'll never go away
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.400]   But if you don't let that sting negatively affect your day-to-day life and your relationships
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.560]   You probably have a risk-appropriate
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:30.080]   Asset allocation on the flip side enjoy the gains, you know, the gains never feel as good as the losses feel
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:38.280]   But again, those gains don't make you have like this crazy investing FOMO where you suddenly alter your asset allocation
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.440]   Towards heavily risk assets or much more riskier assets
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:48.120]   You're just operating in your normal band day to day and part of the reason why
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.680]   You're not very emotional is because as a veteran investor, you know
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:58.360]   The downside risk you accept that trying to make money from risk assets means
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.440]   Occasionally losing money you understand history, you know
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:09.560]   The average bear market lasts between 12 to 15 months and the average drawdown is about 35%
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.680]   So once you know that downside average for investing in stocks, for example
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:20.920]   Then you can calculate how much exposure you should have because when you're investing
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.520]   You're investing to potentially make more money passively
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.160]   And why do we want to make more money passively?
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.600]   To do more of the things we want and less of the things we don't and why do we want more freedom?
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.920]   It's because we know that time is limited
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.440]   We can always make more money, but we can never make more time as a result
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.160]   I highly encourage everyone to translate money into lost or gained time
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:52.040]   Think deeply about it folks time is so much more valuable than money and somewhere around
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.680]   35 to maybe 40 for the average person
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:02.320]   They're gonna start really realizing this because you know, they're gonna feel some maybe aches and pains
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.920]   Maybe friends or family will pass away
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.080]   they're gonna realize more and more how precious time is how ephemeral time is and
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.240]   This you know this constant grind for more and more and more money
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.360]   Will start eating at your soul and I'll start making you wonder, you know
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.900]   What is the point if I'm losing all this time and I can't do the things that I want to really do
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.940]   So the next time you read a financial samurai article
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:35.040]   Think about this basis of time more than money because it's always in my mind when I'm writing and when I'm recording
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.880]   So think about that as I you know present a thesis or share an argument or tell you a story
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.960]   To help you quantify your risk tolerance. I
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.960]   introduced
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.600]   FS seer seer stands for samurai equity
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:54.320]   Exposure rule the FS seer formula is basically this risk tolerance multiple
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.760]   equals your equity exposure
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.240]   Times 35% because 35% is the average bear market drawdown
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.600]   Divided by your monthly gross income. Does it sound confusing?
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.360]   I hope it's not because you'll see her more clearly in the post but your risk tolerance multiple
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:18.520]   Equals the number of months you are willing to work to make up for your potential losses
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.480]   So this formula again risk tolerance multiple equals equity exposure times 35%
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:30.440]   Divided by your monthly gross income can help you find out whether you are risk loving
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:37.040]   Very extreme or very conservative. So for example, let's you have 1 million dollars in equities with a
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.400]   $10,000 monthly gross income so hundred twenty thousand a year
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.360]   You're considered to have an extreme risk tolerance because you are okay with spending
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.920]   36 months
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.960]   Working to make up for your potential equity loss of three hundred sixty thousand
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.560]   So we plug the numbers in take 1 million dollars times
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.080]   35% that's
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:07.920]   350 thousand dollars and then divided by your monthly gross income of ten thousand, right and that equals 36
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.720]   36 months are you really willing to spend 36 months or three years of your life?
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:21.440]   Making up for your losses your potential losses. If so, you've got extreme risk tolerance and that 36 multiple
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.400]   Identified as extreme risk tolerance is my opinion so you can play around
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:34.120]   With that multiple if you think hey, you're willing to spend ten years of your life making up for potential losses
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:41.200]   For that to be considered extreme. Well, you can plug that in and find out how much equity exposure
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.520]   You should have based on your risk tolerance
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:51.320]   So let's do the math again the maximum recommended equity risk exposure equals your monthly salary
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.240]   times your risk tolerance multiple
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.560]   Divided by 35% I remember the risk tolerance multiple
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.720]   I said as extreme was 36, but now you think it's actually 120
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:09.040]   So let's say you take your monthly salary of ten thousand times by 120 you get
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.800]   1.2 million now you divided by 35% or whatever you think is
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.920]   Going to be the drawdown in this bear market
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:25.960]   I'm just gonna go with 35% because that's the average drawdown. So the maximum recommended equity exposure based on your
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.520]   perceived risk tolerance is
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:36.960]   3.4 to 8 million dollars based on a ten thousand dollar monthly income. So how about that folks a very practical?
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.560]   simple
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:46.640]   applicable formula that anybody can use to find their risk tolerance multiple based on their existing exposure and
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.640]   Also to find out the maximum recommended equity exposure
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.760]   Based on what they think their risk tolerance multiple is and we're using time and money
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.040]   We're translating time into money lost time
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.080]   Based on losing money and gain time based on making money from your investments
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:11.120]   And I started this episode by talking about winning the Nobel Prize in economics and I was delusionally thinking
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.640]   But maybe not so much
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:19.480]   Why can't this formula FS here win the Nobel Prize in economics? It's practical. It's applicable
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.980]   It's easy to understand and it takes a very important concept of translating time into money
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:34.400]   I see no tenured professors with PhDs at the most prestigious universities coming up with such a practical formula for millions of investors
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.300]   Instead there are numerous research papers with complex formulas. The average person will never read or utilize
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:47.520]   It doesn't matter folks how great an idea how smart an idea if it is not easily implemented or understood
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.760]   Theory is not as important as practice. So how did I come up with this formula?
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.200]   After all I came to America at 14 and attended public schools, you know
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:04.240]   I'm not supposed to be here. The only way I could have created this helpful formula is through firsthand experience
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.120]   Losing money during the 2000 comm bubble was difficult
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:15.320]   But thankfully I didn't have that much money to invest and so was investing for a whole decade and not seeing much in total returns
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.760]   So I made adjustments by investing more in real assets
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:25.200]   Then seeing 35% of my net worth that took 10 years to accumulate disappear in six months was very painful
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:33.280]   But the 2008 global financial crisis taught me not to extrapolate my income or returns far into the future
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:41.600]   The crisis also reminded me about the importance of diversification and not to confuse brains with a bull market
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.000]   Finally as a practitioner of early retirement since 2012
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.800]   I'm experiencing firsthand what it's like to not have a day job not have day job income
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:58.400]   The scarcity of time is one of the main reasons why I negotiated a severance at 34 in the first place
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.560]   Retiring early was a hedge against dying early so I could live my life with the least number of regrets and
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:11.640]   most of the people I know who invest who are hardcore investors don't write and
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.120]   Most of the hardcore writers I know
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.600]   Don't talk about investing
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.560]   so I think I'm unique in this way that I'm sharing both the ups and downs and the journey of
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.760]   investing and this is how the
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:31.520]   FSC or formula was created by first-hand experience and one of the greatest things about being human is that we're all
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:38.200]   Long-term rational in the short run. We're all going to experience and make mistakes in the long run
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.960]   We learn from our mistakes and make wiser decisions with by this not that the book
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:49.680]   I try to encapsulate all the experience and all the mistakes that I've made to help people make more optimal decisions
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.320]   We won't keep making the same mistakes over and over again. Otherwise, we'd be insane, right?
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.240]   Instead we will rationally learn from other people's mistakes
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:05.960]   Learn from ourselves so we can make better choices going forward this latest bear market stinks
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.760]   But we got to put into perspective
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:14.360]   We've had 10 years of a great run and if you're feeling highly emotional during this latest bear market
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.160]   Then except you probably have an inappropriate asset allocation
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:25.560]   I think it takes two cycles or between 10 to 20 years to figure out what your true risk tolerance is and
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:32.440]   Then it takes an effort to invest accordingly. You're gonna always be tweaking your asset allocation
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:38.040]   You're gonna be in touch with your inner self in terms of how you feel when you're making money and losing money
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:44.200]   Personally, I'm unwilling to spend more than 12 months of my life trying to make up for losses
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.680]   Therefore I consider myself a moderate to conservative investor and it makes sense, right?
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.120]   I left my day job because I thought I had enough now
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:59.040]   I have two goods so I did make more money over the past 10 years to try to generate more passive income
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.000]   But I'm good now. I'm good
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.360]   I don't want to risk having to go back to work because my kids are still young and my daughter is still gonna be home
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.240]   with me until she goes to
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:16.120]   Kindergarten in three years, so it's really precious time that I just don't want to lose because once they're in school
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.160]   They're in school for what eight to nine hours a day
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.740]   Alright, so what do you do when you're feeling highly emotional right now in this bear market?
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:32.320]   So you accept except you have an inappropriate asset allocation and you will either have to lower your exposure to risk assets by selling
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.560]   Some of your assets or saving and investing more in lower risk or risk-free assets or both
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:45.400]   My favorite way to reduce the percentage of risk assets to overall net worth is by raising more cash and buying more
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.360]   Treasuries and other lower risk investments like municipal bonds
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:56.480]   For example, I don't enjoy selling stocks or other risk assets after they've collapsed right after they're down 20 30 40 80 percent
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.920]   You know, that's always a bummer
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.640]   And if you believe in the long-term trend of stocks and real estate and other risk assets
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.680]   You want to hold on for as long as possible?
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:13.360]   Because eventually such assets tend to recover and finally I do want to encourage you to focus on your cash flow
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:19.140]   Because the cash flow every two weeks or every single month or quarter is real
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:25.880]   Whereas the net worth is very volatile and subjective. So focus on your cash flow focus on
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.200]   Bolstering it and adding more income engines because we're in rocky times
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.720]   We're probably gonna be rocky times for another six to twelve months and that's just the way things are in these cycles
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:45.520]   Thanks so much everyone for listening. I do enjoy recording these episodes. They do take time though. So I appreciate the positive reviews
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.840]   They're very motivating. Also. Thanks for picking up my book by this not that the show notes
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:56.680]   We'll have all the relevant links and also shout out to other podcasters who had me on during my book tour
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:04.700]   Stacking Benjamin's show with Joe sell see hi and also journey to launch by Jamila Safran. So thank you so much everyone. Take care
