[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   The following is a conversation with Simon Sinek,
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.280]   author of several books, including "Start With Why,"
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.400]   "Leaders Eat Last," and his latest, "The Infinite Game."
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.760]   He's one of the best communicators
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.680]   of what it takes to be a good leader,
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.900]   to inspire, and to build businesses
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.420]   that solve big, difficult challenges.
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.720]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.940]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.280]   review it with five stars on Apple Podcasts,
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.600]   support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.760]   @LexFriedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.360]   As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.760]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.200]   that can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.640]   I hope that works for you,
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.920]   and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.560]   Quick summary of the ads.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.540]   Two sponsors, Cash App and Masterclass.
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.280]   Please consider supporting the podcast
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.880]   by downloading Cash App and using code LEXPODCAST,
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.880]   and signing up to Masterclass at masterclass.com/lex.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.680]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.520]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.300]   When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.340]   Cash App lets you send money to friends,
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.860]   buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.340]   with as little as $1.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.040]   Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.120]   let me mention that cryptocurrency,
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.640]   in the context of the history of money, is fascinating.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.480]   I recommend "A Scent of Money"
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.580]   as a great book on this history.
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.280]   Debits and credits on ledgers
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.720]   started around 30,000 years ago.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.600]   The US dollar created over 200 years ago,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.980]   and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.360]   released just over 10 years ago.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.880]   So given that history,
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.280]   cryptocurrency's still very much
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.160]   in its early days of development,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.320]   but it's still aiming to, and just might,
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.560]   redefine the nature of money.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.080]   So again, if you get Cash App
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.760]   from the App Store or Google Play,
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.720]   and use the code LEXPODCAST, you get $10,
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.480]   and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.100]   an organization that is helping to advance robotics
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.840]   and STEM education for young people around the world.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.200]   This show is sponsored by Masterclass.

[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.120]   When I first heard about Masterclass,
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.800]   I honestly thought it was too good to be true.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.600]   For $180 a year, you get an all-access pass
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.680]   to watch courses from experts at the top of their field.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.560]   To list some of my favorites,
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.200]   Chris Hadfield on space exploration,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.280]   Neil deGrasse Tyson on scientific thinking
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.680]   and communication, Will Wright,
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.260]   the creator of "SimCity" and "Sims" on game design.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.840]   I love that game.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.840]   Jane Goodall on conservation,
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.400]   Carlos Santana, one of my favorite guitarists on guitar,
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.520]   Garry Kasparov on chess.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.760]   Obviously I'm Russian, I love Garry.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.300]   Daniel Negrano on poker,
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.040]   one of my favorite poker players, also Phil Ivey,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.320]   gives a course as well, and many, many more.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.040]   Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.200]   and the experience of being launched into space alone
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.920]   is worth the money.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.540]   By way of advice, for me,
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.200]   the key is not to be overwhelmed by the abundance of choice.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.180]   Pick three courses you want to complete,
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.560]   watch each all the way through from start to finish.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.780]   It's not that long, but it's an experience
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.940]   that will stick with you for a long time, I promise.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.460]   It's easily worth the money.
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.040]   You can watch it on basically any device.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.060]   Once again, sign up at masterclass.com/lex
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.740]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.440]   And now, here's my conversation with Simon Sinek.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.140]   In "The Infinite Game," your most recent book,
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.060]   you describe the finite game and the infinite game.
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.660]   So from my perspective of artificial intelligence
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.580]   and game theory in general, I'm a huge fan of.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.220]   Finite games, from the broad philosophical sense,
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.620]   is something that in the robotics,
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.620]   artificial intelligence space, we know how to deal with.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.700]   And then you describe the infinite game,
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.940]   which has no exact static rules,
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.340]   has no well-defined static objective,
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.740]   the players are known, unknown, they change,
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.420]   there's a dynamic element.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.460]   So this is something that applies
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.740]   to business, politics, life itself.
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.620]   So can you try to articulate the objective function here
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.540]   of the infinite game, or in the cliche,
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.540]   broad philosophical sense, what is the meaning of life?
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.460]   (Simon laughs)
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.940]   - Go for the start with the softballs.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.540]   - Yep, easy question first.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.740]   - So James Kars was the philosopher
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.260]   who originally articulated this concept
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.980]   of finite and infinite games.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.180]   And when I learned about it,
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.980]   it really challenged my view of how the world works, right?
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.500]   Because I think we all think about winning
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.940]   and being the best and being number one.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.300]   But if you think about it,
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.840]   only in a finite game can that exist,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.840]   a game that has fixed rules, agreed upon objectives,
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.940]   and known players like football or baseball.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.300]   There's always a beginning, middle and end.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.060]   And if there's a winner, there has to be a loser.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.580]   Infinite games, as Kars describes them,
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.860]   as you said, have known and unknown players,
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.540]   which means anyone can join.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.140]   It has a changeable rules,
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.780]   which means you can play however you want.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.380]   And the objective is to perpetuate the game,
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.120]   to stay in the game as long as possible.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.060]   In other words, there's no such thing
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.380]   as being number one or winning
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.620]   in a game that has no finish line.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.620]   And what I learned is that when we try to win
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.780]   in a game that has no finish line,
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.820]   we try and be number, we try and be the best
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.600]   in a game that has no agreed upon objectives
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.300]   or agreed upon metrics or timeframes.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.820]   There's a few consistent and predictable outcomes.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.380]   The decline of trust, the decline of cooperation,
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.680]   the decline of innovation.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.740]   And I find this fascinating
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.420]   because so many of the ways that we run most organizations
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.980]   is with a finite mindset.
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.900]   - So trying to reduce the beautiful, complex thing
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.540]   that is life or what politics or business
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.020]   into something very narrow.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.800]   And in that process, the reductionist process,
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.220]   you lose something fundamental
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.200]   that makes the whole thing work in the longterm.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.580]   So returning, I'm not going to let you off the hook easy.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.900]   What is the meaning of life?
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.420]   So what is the objective function
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.980]   that is worthwhile to pursue?
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.060]   - Well, if you think about our tombstones, right?
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.440]   They have the date we were born and the date we died.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.860]   But really it's what we do with the gap in between.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.780]   There's a poem called "The Dash."
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.920]   You know, it's the dash that matters.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.440]   It's what we do between the time we're born
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.720]   and the time we die that gives our life meaning.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.120]   And if we live our lives with a finite mindset,
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.340]   which means to accumulate more power or money
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.280]   than anybody else, to outdo everyone else,
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.680]   to be number one, to be the best,
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.840]   we don't take any of us with us.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.500]   We don't take any of it with us.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.460]   We just die.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.040]   The people who get remembered,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.160]   the way we want to be remembered
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.240]   is what kind of people we were, right?
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.040]   Devoted mother, loving father,
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.520]   what kind of person we were to other people.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.160]   Jack Welch just died recently.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.800]   And the Washington Post,
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.360]   when it wrote the headline for his obit,
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.160]   it wrote, "He pleased Wall Street and distressed employees."
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.540]   And that's his legacy.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.880]   A finite player who is obsessed with winning,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.000]   who leaves behind a legacy of short-term gains for a few
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.640]   and distress for many.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.480]   That's his legacy.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.000]   And every single one of us gets the choice
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.640]   of the kind of legacy we want to have.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.480]   Do we want to be remembered for our contributions
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.880]   or our detractions?
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.160]   To live with a finite mindset,
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.780]   to live a career with a finite mindset,
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.280]   to be number one, be the best, be the most famous,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.080]   you live a life like Jack Welch.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.180]   To live a life of service, to see those around us rise,
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.980]   to contribute to our communities, to our organizations,
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.600]   to leave them in better shape than we found them,
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.840]   that's the kind of legacy most of us would like to have.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.700]   - So day-to-day, when you think about
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.200]   what is the fundamental goals, dreams,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:20.920]   motivations of an infinite game,
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.540]   of seeing your life, your career as an infinite game,
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.160]   what does that look like?
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.640]   - I mean, I guess I'm sort of trying to stick
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.160]   on this personal ego, personal drive,
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.320]   the thing that, the fire,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.080]   the reason we want to wake up in the morning
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.520]   and the reason we can't go to bed
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.640]   because we're so excited, what is that?
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.800]   - So for me, it's about having a just cause.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.280]   It's about a vision that's bigger than me,
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.660]   that my work gets to contribute
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.320]   to something larger than myself.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.340]   That's what drives me every day.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.800]   I wake up every morning with a vision of a world
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.640]   that does not yet exist,
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.560]   a world in which the vast majority of people wake up
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.040]   every single morning inspired, feel safe at work
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.080]   and return home fulfilled at the end of the day.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.640]   It is not the world we live in.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.680]   And so that we still have work to do
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.640]   is the thing that drives me.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.240]   I know what my underlying values are.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.880]   I wake up to inspire people to do the things
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.720]   that inspire them.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.120]   And these are the things that,
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.040]   these are the things that I,
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.840]   these are my go-tos, my touch points
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.200]   that inspire me to keep working.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.760]   I think of a career like an iceberg.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.000]   If you have a vision for something,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.680]   you're the only one who can see the iceberg
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.320]   underneath the ocean.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.280]   But if you start working at it, a little bit shows up.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.200]   And now a few other people can see what you imagine,
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.480]   be like, oh, right, yeah, no,
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.680]   I wanna help build that as well.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.320]   And if you have a lot of success,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.280]   then you have a lot of iceberg
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.360]   and people can see this huge iceberg
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.000]   and they say, you've accomplished so much.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.080]   But what I see is all the work still yet to be done.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.720]   Yet I still see the huge iceberg underneath the ocean.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.240]   - And so the growth, you talk about momentum.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.720]   So the incremental revealing of the iceberg
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.120]   is what drives you.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.680]   - Well, it necessarily is incremental.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.600]   What drives me is that, is the realization,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.480]   is realizing the iceberg,
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.040]   bringing more of the iceberg from the unknown to the known,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.360]   bringing more of the vision from the imagination to reality.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.480]   - And you have this fundamental vision of optimism.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.400]   You call yourself an optimist.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.160]   I mean, in this world, I have a sort of,
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.400]   I see myself a little bit as the main character
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.360]   from "The Idiot" by Dostoevsky,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.080]   who is also kind of seen by society as a fool
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.320]   because he was optimistic.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.240]   So one, can you maybe articulate
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.560]   where that sense of optimism comes from
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.120]   and maybe also try to articulate your vision of the future
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.960]   where people are inspired, where optimism drives us?
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.160]   It's easy to forget that when you look at social media
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.080]   and so on, where toxicity and negativity
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.080]   can often get more likes,
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.280]   that optimism has a sort of a beauty to it.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.080]   And I do hope it's out there.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.280]   So can you try to articulate that vision?
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.320]   - Yeah, so, I mean, for me, optimism and being an optimist
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.160]   is just seeing the silver lining in every cloud.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.280]   Even in tragedy, it brings people together.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.680]   And the question is, can we see that?
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.820]   Can you see the beauty that is in everything?
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.400]   I don't think optimism is foolishness.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.960]   I don't think optimism is blindness,
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.960]   though it probably involves some naivete,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.720]   the belief that things will get better,
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.480]   the belief that we tend towards the good,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.960]   even in times of struggle or bad.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:42.360]   You can't sustain war, but you can sustain peace.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.480]   I think things that are stable are more sustainable,
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.520]   things that are optimistic are more sustainable
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.080]   than things that are chaotic.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.840]   - So you see people as fundamentally good.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.480]   I mean, some people may disagree
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.400]   that you can't sustain peace, you can't sustain war.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.720]   - I mean, you don't have to, I think war is costly.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.240]   It involves life and money,
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.440]   and peace does not involve those things.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.720]   It requires work.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.680]   I'm not saying it doesn't require work,
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.080]   but it doesn't drain resources,
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.440]   I think, the same way that war does.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.480]   - The people that would say that we will always have war,
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.720]   and I just talked to the historian of Stalin,
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:27.080]   would say that conflict and the desire for power
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.520]   and conflict is central to human nature.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.840]   - I concur.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.920]   - But something in your words also,
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.080]   perhaps it's the naive aspect that I also share,
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.440]   is that you have an optimism
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.320]   that people are fundamentally good.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.440]   - I'm an idealist, and I think idealism is good.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.760]   I'm not a fool to believe that the ideals
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.400]   that I imagine can come true.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.440]   Of course, there'll never be world peace,
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.760]   but shouldn't we die trying?
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.120]   You know, I think that's the whole point.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.160]   That's the whole point of vision.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.520]   Vision should be idealistic,
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.440]   and it should be, for all practical purposes, impossible.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.360]   But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try,
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.880]   and it's the milestones that we reach
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.200]   that take us closer to that ideal
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.360]   that make us feel that our life and our work have meaning,
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.400]   and we're contributing to something bigger than ourselves.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.200]   You know, just because it's impossible
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.560]   doesn't mean we shouldn't try.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.680]   As I said, we're still moving the ball down the field.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.080]   We're still making progress.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.640]   Things are still getting better,
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.240]   even if we never get to that ideal state.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.520]   So I think idealism is a good thing.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.240]   - You know, in the word infinite game,
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.040]   one of the beautiful and tragic aspects of life,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.080]   human life at least,
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.400]   at least from the biological perspective, is that it ends.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.600]   So sadly-- - To some people, yeah.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.320]   - Fine, it's tragic to some people, or is it ends?
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.680]   - I think some people believe that it ends
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.280]   on the day you die, and some people think it continues on.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.800]   - And there's a lot of different ways to think
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   what continues on even looks like.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.840]   But let me drag it back to the personal.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.160]   - Sure. - Which is,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.200]   how do you think about your own mortality?
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.680]   Are you afraid of death?
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.160]   How do you think about your own death?
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.360]   - I definitely haven't accomplished everything
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.040]   I wanna contribute to.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.600]   I would like more time on this earth
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.640]   to keep working towards that vision.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.520]   - Do you think about the fact that it ends for you?
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.920]   Are you cognizant of-- - Of course I'm cognizant of it.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.000]   I mean, aren't we all?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.920]   I don't dwell on it.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.120]   I'm aware of it.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.640]   I know that my life is finite,
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.000]   and I know that I have a certain amount of time left
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.400]   on this planet, and I'd like to make that time be valuable.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.720]   - Some people would think that ideas
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   kind of allow you to have a certain kind of immortality.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:54.600]   Maybe to linger on this kind of question,
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.440]   so first to push back on the,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.840]   you said that everyone's cognizant of their mortality.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.640]   There's a guy named Ernest Becker who would disagree
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.480]   that you basically say that most of human cognition
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.960]   is created by us trying to create an illusion
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.320]   and try to hide from ourselves the fact
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.520]   that we're gonna die, to try to think
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.000]   that it's all gonna go on forever.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.560]   - But the fact that we know that it doesn't.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.840]   - Yes, but this mix of denial.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.400]   I mean, I think the book's called "Denial of Death."
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.560]   It's this constant denial that we're running away from.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:33.760]   In fact, some would argue that the inspiration,
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.520]   the incredible ideas you've put out there,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.480]   your TED Talk has been seen by millions
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.800]   and millions of people, right?
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.720]   It's just you trying to desperately fight the fact
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.800]   that you are biologically mortal.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.080]   Your creative genius comes from the fact
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.400]   that you're trying to create ideas
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.040]   that live on long past you.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.120]   - Well, that's very nice of you.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.240]   I mean, I would like my ideas to live on beyond me
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.400]   because I think that is a good test
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.520]   that those ideas have value in the lives of others.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.880]   I think that's a good test that others would continue
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.880]   to talk about or share the ideas long after I'm gone,
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.360]   I think is perhaps the greatest compliment
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.920]   one can get for one's own work.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.440]   But I don't think it's my awareness of my mortality
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.560]   that drives me to do it.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.200]   It's my desire to contribute that drives me to do it.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.760]   - It's the optimist vision.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.440]   It's the pleasure and the fulfillment you get
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.560]   from inspiring others.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.160]   It's as pure as that.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.320]   Let me ask, listen, I'm rushing.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.680]   I'm trying to get you-- - You're good, you're good.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.600]   I'm enjoying it. - Get you into these dark areas.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.440]   - You're good, I'm enjoying it.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.960]   - Is the ego tied up into it somehow?
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.400]   So your name is extremely well known.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.080]   If your name wasn't attached to it,
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.520]   do you think you would act differently?
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.240]   - I mean, for years, I hated that my name was attached to it.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.440]   I had a rule for years that I wouldn't have
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.200]   my face on the front page of the website.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.880]   I had a fight with the publisher
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.080]   because I didn't want my name big on the book.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.480]   I wanted it tiny on the book
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.080]   'cause I kept telling them it's not about me,
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.200]   it's about the ideas.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.800]   They wanted to put my name on the top of my book.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.680]   I refused.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.440]   None of my books have my names on the top
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.320]   because I won't let them.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.560]   They would like very much to put my name
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.400]   on the top of the book,
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.240]   but the idea has to be bigger than me.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.080]   I'm not bigger than the idea.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.920]   - That's beautifully put.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.440]   Do you think ego--
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.960]   - But I also am aware that I've become,
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.320]   I've become recognized as the messenger.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.000]   And even though I still think the message is bigger than me,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.160]   I recognize that I have a responsibility as the messenger.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.600]   And whether I like it or not is irrelevant.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.520]   I accept the responsibility.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.680]   I am happy to do it.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.760]   - I'm not sure how to phrase this,
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.960]   but there's a large part of the culture right now
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.440]   that emphasizes all the things that nobody disagrees with,
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.120]   which is health, sleep, diet, relaxation,
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.240]   meditation, vacation-- - That's true.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.360]   - Are really important.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.760]   And there's no, you know, it's like,
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.480]   you can't really argue against that.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.440]   In fact, people--
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.040]   - Less sleep.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.080]   - Less-- - I'm joking.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.920]   - Yes, well, that's the thing.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.840]   I often speak to the fact that passion
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.800]   and love for what you're doing
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.320]   and the two words hard work,
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.320]   especially in the engineering fields,
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.000]   are more important to prioritize than sleep.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.120]   Even though sleep is really important,
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.560]   your mind should be obsessed with the hard work,
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.840]   with the passion, and so on.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.920]   And then I get some pushback, of course, from people.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.080]   Would he make sense of that?
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.160]   Is that just me, the crazy Russian engineer,
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.320]   really pushing hard work?
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.160]   - Probably.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.120]   I think that's a short-term strategy.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.920]   I think if you sacrifice your health for the work,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.360]   at some point, it catches up with you.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.480]   And at some point, it's like going, going, going,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.440]   and you get sick.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.720]   Your body will shut down for you
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.920]   if you refuse to take care of yourself.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.760]   You get sick, it's what happens.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.520]   Sometimes, more severe illness
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.240]   than something that just slows you down.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.920]   So I think taking, like getting sleep,
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.120]   I mean, there've been studies on this,
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.960]   that executives, for example,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.000]   who get a full night's sleep and stop at a reasonable hour
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.560]   actually accomplish more, are more productive
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.520]   than people who work and burn the midnight oil
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.460]   because their brains are working better,
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.360]   because they're well-rested.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.920]   So, you know, working hard, yes,
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.360]   but wouldn't that work smart?
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:45.360]   I think that giving our minds and our bodies rest
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.600]   makes us more efficient.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.160]   I think just driving, driving, driving, driving
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.040]   is a short-term strategy.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.280]   - So but to push back on that a little bit,
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.040]   the annoying thing is you're like 100% right
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.680]   in terms of science, right?
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.960]   But the thing is, it's because you're 100% right,
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.560]   that weak part of your mind uses that fact
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.160]   to convince you, like what, so, you know,
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.120]   I get all kinds of, my mind comes up
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.320]   with all kinds of excuses to try to convince me
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.040]   that I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:16.880]   - To rationalize.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.080]   - To rationalize.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.320]   And so what I have a sense,
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.840]   I think what you said about executives and leaders
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.860]   is absolutely right, but there's the early days,
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.120]   the early days of madness and passion.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:29.960]   - For sure.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.720]   - Then I feel like emphasizing sleep,
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.560]   thinking about sleep as giving yourself a way out
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.480]   from the fact that those early days,
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.800]   especially, can be suffering.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.680]   - As long, it's not sustainable.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.980]   You know, it's not sustainable.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.120]   Sure, if you're investing all that energy in something
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.600]   at the beginning to get it up and running,
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.640]   then at some point you're gonna have to slow down
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.560]   or your body will slow you down for you.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.960]   Like you can choose or your body can choose.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.640]   I mean.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.800]   - So, okay, so you don't think, from my perspective,
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.360]   it feels like people have gotten a little bit soft,
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.200]   but you're saying no.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.120]   - No, I think that there seems evidence
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.120]   that working harder and later have taken a back seat.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.680]   I think we have to be careful with the broad generalizations
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.160]   but I think if you go into the workplace,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.560]   there are people who would complain
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.760]   that more people now than before, you know,
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.920]   look at their watches and say,
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.240]   oops, five o'clock, goodbye, right?
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.600]   Now, is that a problem with the people?
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.720]   You're saying it's the people giving themselves excuses
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.960]   and people don't work hard,
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.800]   or is it the organizations aren't giving them
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.840]   something to believe in, something to be passionate about?
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.140]   We can't manufacture passion.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.100]   You can't just tell someone, be passionate.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.400]   You know, that's not how it works.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.100]   Passion's an output, not an input.
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.480]   Like if I believe in something
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.840]   and I want to contribute all that energy to do it,
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.280]   we call that passion.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.360]   You know, working hard for something we love is passion.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.180]   Working hard for something we don't care about
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.780]   is called stress, but we're working hard either way.
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.440]   So I think the organizations bear some accountability
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.720]   and our leaders bear some accountability,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.640]   which is if they're not offering a sense of purpose,
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.520]   if they're not offering us a sense of cause,
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.680]   if they're not telling us that our work is worth more
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.800]   than simply the money it makes,
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.220]   then yeah, I'm gonna come at five o'clock
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.200]   because I don't really care about making you money.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.600]   Remember, we live in a world right now
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.960]   where a lot of people, rather a few people,
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.720]   are getting rich on the hard work of others.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.000]   And so I think when people look up and say,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.600]   well, why would I do that?
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.600]   If you're not gonna look after me
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.180]   and then you're gonna lay me off at the end of the year
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.460]   because you missed your arbitrary projections,
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.740]   you know, you're gonna lay me off
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.960]   because you missed your arbitrary projections,
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.440]   then why would I offer my hard work and loyalty to you?
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.780]   So I don't think we can immediately blame people
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.960]   for going soft.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   I think we can blame leaders for their inability or failure
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.440]   to offer their people something bigger
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.700]   than making a product or making money.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.320]   - Yeah, so that's brilliant.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.000]   And start with why, leaders you last, your books.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.880]   You kind of, you basically talk about
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.000]   what it takes to be a good leader.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.720]   And so some of the blame should go on the leader,
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.880]   but how much of it is on finding your passion?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   How much is it on the individual?
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.760]   And allowing yourself to pursue that passion,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.120]   pushing yourself to your limits
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.220]   to really take concrete steps
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.200]   along your path towards that passion.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.600]   - Yeah, there's mutual responsibility.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.520]   There's mutual accountability.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.380]   I mean, we're responsible as individuals
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.360]   to find the organizations
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.200]   and find the leaders that inspire us.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.960]   And organizations are responsible for maintaining that flame
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.920]   and giving people who believe what they believed,
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.620]   you know, a chance to contribute.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.800]   - Sort of to linger on it,
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.080]   have you by chance seen the movie "Whiplash"?
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.920]   - Yes.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.400]   - Again, maybe I'm romanticizing suffering.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.440]   Again. - It's the Russian in you.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.260]   - It's the Russian.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.400]   - Yeah, the Russians love suffering.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.080]   - But for people who haven't seen,
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.920]   it's the movie "Whiplash" as a drum instructor
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.920]   that pushes the drum musician to his limits
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.720]   to bring out the best in him.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.600]   And there's a toxic nature to it.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.840]   There's suffering in it.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.360]   Like you've worked with a lot of great leaders,
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.720]   a lot of great individuals.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.400]   Is that toxic relationship as toxic
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.520]   as it appears in the movie?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.480]   Or is that fundamental?
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.680]   I've seen that relationship,
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.520]   especially in the past with Olympic athletes,
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.000]   especially in athletics,
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.920]   extreme performers seem to do wonders.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.120]   It does wonders for me.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.960]   There's some of my best relationships.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.720]   Now I'm not representative of everyone, certainly.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.160]   But some of my best relationships for mentee and mentor
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.940]   have been toxic from an external perspective.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.760]   What do you make of that movie?
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.640]   What do you make of that kind of relationship?
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.240]   - That's not my favorite movie.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.200]   (laughing)
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.000]   - Okay, so you don't think that's a healthy,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.680]   you don't think that kind of relationship
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.280]   is a great example of a great leader?
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.120]   - I think it's a short-term strategy.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.520]   I mean, look, being hard on someone
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.920]   is not the same as toxicity.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.120]   If you go to the Marine Corps,
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.920]   a drill instructor will be very hard on their Marines.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.520]   But still, even on the last day of bootcamp,
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.040]   they'll take their hat off and they'll become a human.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.800]   But of all the drill instructors,
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.760]   the three or four main drill instructors
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.520]   assigned to a group of recruits,
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.120]   the one that they all want the respect of
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.120]   is the one that's the hardest on them.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.320]   That's true.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.680]   And you hear, there's plenty of stories of people
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.960]   who wanna earn the respect of a hard parent
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.080]   or a hard teacher.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.040]   But fundamental, that parent, that teacher,
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.320]   that drill instructor has to believe in that person,
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.640]   has to see potential in them.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.000]   It's not a formula, which is if I'm hard on people,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.120]   they'll do well, which is there has to still be love.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.000]   It has to be done with absolute love,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.960]   and it has to be done responsibly.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.520]   I mean, some people can take a little more pressure
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.840]   than others, but I think it's irresponsible
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.680]   to think of it as a formula,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.440]   that if I'm just toxic at people, they will do well.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.240]   It depends on their personalities, first of all.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.880]   That works for some, but not all.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.520]   And second of all, it can't be done willy-nilly.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.080]   It has to still be done with care and love.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   And sometimes you can get equal or better results
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.840]   without all of the toxicity.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.880]   - I guess toxicity, on my part,
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.520]   was a really bad word to use.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.400]   But if we talk about what makes a good leader
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.640]   and just look at an example in particular,
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.440]   looking at Elon Musk, he's known to push people
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.440]   to their limits in a way that I think really challenges
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.000]   people in a way they've never been challenged before,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.400]   to do the impossible.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.280]   But it can really break people.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.200]   - And jobs was hard, and Amazon is hard.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.200]   But the thing that's important is none of them lie about it.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.360]   People ask me about Amazon all the time.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.720]   Like, Jeff Bezos never lied about it.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.400]   Even the ones who like Amazon don't last
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.840]   more than a couple of years before they burn out.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.280]   But when we're honest about the culture,
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.600]   then it gives people the opportunity
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.040]   who like to work in that kind of culture
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.880]   to choose to work in that kind of culture.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.280]   As opposed to pretending and saying,
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.480]   "Oh no, this is all lovey-lovey here."
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.240]   And then you show up and it's the furthest thing from it.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.360]   So, I mean, I think the reputations
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.040]   of putting a lot of pressure on people to...
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.760]   Jobs was not an easy man to work for.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.920]   He pushed people, but everyone who worked there
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.960]   was given the space to create and do things
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.720]   that they would not have been able to do anywhere else,
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.960]   and work at a level that they didn't work anywhere else.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.720]   And Jobs didn't have all the answers.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.120]   I mean, he pushed his people to come up with answers.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.840]   He wasn't just looking for people to execute his ideas.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.480]   And people did.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.680]   People accomplished more than they thought
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.320]   they were capable of, which is wonderful.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.160]   - How do you...
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.520]   You're talking about the infinite game,
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.840]   and not thinking about too short term,
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.800]   and yet you see some of the most brilliant people
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.680]   in the world being pushed by Elon Musk
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.040]   to accomplish some of the most incredible things.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.400]   When we're talking about autopilot,
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.400]   when we're talking about some of the hardware engineering,
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.120]   they do some of the best work of their life,
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.320]   and then leave.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.640]   How do you balance that in terms of
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.680]   what it takes to be a good leader,
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.280]   what it takes to accomplish great things in your life?
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.680]   - Yeah, so I think there's a difference between
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.640]   someone who can get a lot out of people in the short term,
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.680]   and building an organization
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.640]   that can sustain beyond any individual.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.040]   There's a difference.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.400]   - When you say beyond any individual,
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.040]   you mean beyond, like if the leader dies?
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.880]   - Correct.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.520]   Like could Tesla continue to do what it's doing
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.680]   without Elon Musk?
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   - And you're perhaps implying,
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.600]   which is a very interesting question, that it cannot.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.440]   - I don't know.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.480]   The argument you're making of this person
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.560]   who pushes everyone, arguably is not a repeatable model.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.760]   Is Apple the same without Steve Jobs?
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.240]   Or is it slowly moving in a different direction?
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.920]   Or has he established something that could be resurrected
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.040]   with the right leader?
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.680]   - That was his dream, I think,
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.920]   is to build an organization that lives on beyond him.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.760]   At least I remember reading that somewhere.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.280]   - I think that's what a lot of leaders desire,
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.720]   which is to create something that was bigger than them.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.480]   Most businesses, most entrepreneurial ventures
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.920]   could not pass the school bus test,
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.160]   which is if the founder was hit by a school bus,
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.840]   would everyone continue the business without them,
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.160]   or would they all just go find jobs?
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.240]   And the vast majority of companies would fail that test,
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.320]   especially in the entrepreneurial world,
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.040]   that if you take the inspired visionary leader away,
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.400]   the whole thing collapses.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.640]   So is that a business,
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.920]   or is that just a force of personality?
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.280]   And a lot of entrepreneurs face that reality,
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.600]   which is they have to be in every meeting,
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.120]   make every decision, come up with every idea,
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.880]   because if they don't, who will?
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.040]   And the question is,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.280]   well, what have you done to build your bench?
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:35.440]   Sometimes it's ego, the belief that only I can.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.440]   Sometimes it's just things did so well for so long
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.680]   that just forgot.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.200]   And sometimes it's a failure
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.800]   to build the training programs
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.760]   or hire the right people that could replace you,
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.080]   who are maybe smarter and better.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.480]   And browbeating people is only one strategy.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.440]   I don't think it's necessarily the only strategy,
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.040]   nor is it always the best strategy.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.080]   I think people get to choose the cultures
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.920]   they wanna work in.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.720]   So this is why I think companies should be honest
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.200]   about the kind of culture that they've created.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.080]   I heard a story about Apple
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.600]   where somebody came in from a big company,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:26.200]   he had accomplished a lot and his ego was very large
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.400]   and he was going on about how he did this and he did that
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.440]   and he did this and he did that.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.280]   And somebody from Apple said,
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.560]   "We don't care what you've done.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.320]   The question is, what are you gonna do?"
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:42.000]   And for somebody who wants to be pushed,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.520]   that's the place you go,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.120]   because you choose to be pushed.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.240]   Now, we all wanna be pushed to some degree.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.320]   Anybody who wants to accomplish anything in this world
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.560]   wants to be pushed to some degree,
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.840]   whether it's through self-pressure or external pressure
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.280]   or public pressure, whatever it is.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:03.560]   But I think this whole idea of one size fits all
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.360]   is a false narrative of how leadership works.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.160]   But what all leadership requires is creating an environment
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.120]   in which people can work at their natural best.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.480]   - But you have a sense that it's possible
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.320]   to create a business where it lives on beyond you.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.280]   So if we look at now,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.320]   if we just look at this current moment,
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.640]   I just recently talked to Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter,
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.320]   and he's under a lot of pressure now.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.720]   I don't know if you're aware of the news
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.920]   that he's being pushed out as potentially
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.260]   as the CEO of Twitter,
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.680]   'cause he's the CEO already
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.760]   of an incredibly successful company.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.200]   Plus he wants to go to Africa to live a few months in Africa
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.880]   to connect with the world that's outside of Silicon Valley.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.840]   And sort of there's this idea,
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.440]   well, can Twitter live without Jack?
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.280]   - We'll find out.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:55.320]   - But you have a general, as a student of great leadership,
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.600]   you have a general sense that it's possible.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   - Yeah, of course it's possible.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.680]   I mean, what Bill Gates built with Microsoft
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.280]   may not have survived Steve Ballmer
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.520]   if the company weren't so rich.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.200]   But Satya Nardala is putting it back on track again.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.760]   It's become a visionary company again.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.960]   It's attracting great talent again.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.880]   It went through a period where they couldn't get
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.720]   the best talent and the best talent was leaving.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.520]   Now people want to work for Microsoft again.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.720]   Well, that's not because of pressure.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.160]   Ballmer put more pressure on people
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.760]   mainly to hit numbers than anything else.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.560]   That didn't work.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.280]   - Yes. - Right?
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.120]   And so the question is,
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.360]   what kind of pressure are we putting on people?
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.620]   We're putting on pressure people to hit numbers
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.200]   or hit arbitrary deadlines,
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.480]   or putting on pressure on people
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.920]   because we believe that they can do better work.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.400]   And the work that we're trying to do
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.600]   is to advance a vision that's bigger than all of us.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.960]   And if you're gonna put pressure on people,
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.720]   it better be for the right reason.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.960]   Like if you're gonna put pressure on me,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.520]   it better be for a worthwhile reason.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.320]   If it's just to hit a goal,
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.960]   if it's just to hit some arbitrary date
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.120]   or some arbitrary number or make a stock price
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.080]   hit some target, you can keep it, I'm out of here.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.140]   But if you want to put pressure on me
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:06.920]   because we are brothers and sisters in arms,
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.040]   working to advance a cause bigger than ourselves,
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.680]   that we believe whatever we're gonna build
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.360]   will significantly contribute
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.160]   to the greater good of society,
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.240]   then go ahead, I'll take the pressure.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.360]   And if you look at the apples
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   and if you look at the Elon Musk's,
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.120]   the jobs in the Elon Musk,
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.080]   they fundamentally believe that what they were doing
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.200]   would improve society and it was for the good of humankind.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.420]   And so the pressure, in other words,
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.060]   what they were doing was more important,
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.360]   more valuable than any individual on the team.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.220]   And so the pressure they put on people
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.980]   served a greater good.
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.700]   And so we looked to the left
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.580]   and we looked to the right to each other and said,
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.100]   we're in this together.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.580]   We accept this, we want this.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.860]   But if it's just pressure to hit a number
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.120]   or make the widget move a little faster,
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.380]   and that's soul sucking.
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.580]   That's not passion, that's stress.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:11.180]   And I think a lot of leaders confuse
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.300]   that making people work hard
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.000]   is not what makes them passionate.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.580]   Giving them something to believe in
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.900]   and work on is what drives passion.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.860]   - And when you have that,
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.660]   then turning up the pressure only brings people together,
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.500]   drives them further.
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.860]   - If done the right way.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:29.920]   - Done the right way.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.300]   Speaking of pressure,
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:37.040]   I'm gonna give you 90 seconds to answer the last question,
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.480]   which is if I told you that tomorrow
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.200]   was your last day to live,
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.920]   we talked about mortality,
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.280]   sunrise to sunset,
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.360]   can you tell me, can you take me through the day?
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.520]   What do you think that day would involve?
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.240]   You can't spend it with your family,
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   I told you as well.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.000]   - I would probably want to fill all of my senses
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.160]   with things that excite my senses.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.480]   I'd want to look at beautiful art,
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.940]   I'd want to listen to beautiful music,
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.980]   I'd want to taste incredible food,
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.960]   I'd want to smell amazing tastes,
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.960]   I'd want to touch something that's beautiful to touch,
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:18.220]   I'd want all of my senses to just be consumed
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.180]   with things that I find beautiful.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.340]   - And you talked about this idea of,
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.860]   we don't do it often these days,
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.140]   of just listening to music,
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.420]   turning off all the devices
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.900]   and actually taking in and listening to music.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.820]   So as an addendum,
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.580]   if we were to talk about music,
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.460]   what song would you be blasting
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.140]   in this last day you're alive?
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.180]   Is it Led Zeppelin, what are we talking about?
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.980]   - No, no, there's probably gonna be a Beatles song in there,
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.180]   there'll definitely be some Beethoven in there.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.820]   - The classics. - The classics.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.160]   - Okay. - Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.860]   - Thank you so much for talking today,
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.620]   thank you for making time for it.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.020]   Under pressure, we made it happen.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.860]   - Yeah, it was great.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.420]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation

[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.020]   from Simon Sinek.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.260]   There are only two ways to influence human behavior.
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.460]   You can manipulate it, or you can inspire it.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.220]   Thank you for listening,
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.100]   I hope to see you next time.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.260]   (upbeat music)
