[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.600]   - You spent a lot of time in the book
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.840]   talking about financial planning
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.000]   and after you do the hard work about how to do it.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.880]   And I like this kind of idea of, you know,
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.420]   bringing something fun to the conversation.
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.800]   So it's a dining room table.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.280]   You said it's not a flamingo.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.200]   I can't remember all the other,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.300]   it's not a three-legged stool.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.520]   Talk a little bit about what that is.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.200]   What is the financial plan to you?
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.980]   Because I think as someone who started
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.240]   a financial planning company,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.580]   it can be a big thing that's daunting,
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.360]   that is complicated and takes hours and hours to go through.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.440]   Or you can kind of think about it in a more simple framework
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.320]   like I think you present.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.240]   - So the idea is, you know, the American table,
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.000]   the dining room table is an institution in our country,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.840]   right?
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.060]   This idea that the family sits around it.
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.040]   And I like it as a model for how our financial plans
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.720]   should be because it's stable, right?
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.160]   It's hard to knock over a dining room table.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.960]   It's solid, well-built, and it supports us.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.580]   And I think we should look at our financial plan
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.420]   the same way.
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.480]   So a lot of people build a financial plan
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.040]   that looks a lot like a flamingo, right?
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.960]   Think about a flamingo.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.960]   They've got their one leg.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.560]   They're incredibly unstable.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.160]   Anything could knock them over.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.720]   This is the person who really puts all their eggs
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.720]   in one basket, right?
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.160]   They have their W-2 job.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.540]   They work for some company.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.280]   And maybe if they do invest at all in stock,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.560]   maybe it's through their 401k.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.760]   Maybe it's actually in that company itself.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.240]   And so everything depends on this one company.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.880]   And God forbid, you know, a la Enron,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.120]   this company goes down, something happens to it.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.400]   The flamingo is incredibly easy to knock over, right?
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.520]   So then you can think about a two-legged table or stool,
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.980]   still not that stable, but a little bit better, right?
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.280]   That might be someone who has a W-2 job.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.920]   And maybe they now have a 401k
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.280]   with some broad-based index funds, right?
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.560]   Or maybe some bonds.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.400]   So again, a little bit more stability,
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.880]   but still not perfect.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.960]   And then we start thinking,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.720]   how can we even make it more stable?
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.680]   Like a three-legged stool.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.680]   Now maybe we add in a side hustle or some real estate, right?
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.920]   And so then again, we're now creating more space.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.120]   And then the four-legged dining room table,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.920]   something that even if you knock a leg off
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.200]   is still gonna be incredibly stable, you know,
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.360]   is your W-2 job plus the broad-based index funds,
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.040]   plus some real estate, plus a side hustle.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.320]   Maybe if you're excited about some alternatives,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.260]   you have a little crypto here or there.
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.120]   Again, the idea is you're creating these different legs.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.840]   It's this idea of a diversification,
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.820]   but it makes it a little bit more obvious.
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.940]   And again, the whole point of this is,
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.720]   really what we do wanna do
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.840]   is we wanna build a financial plan
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.180]   that supports our sense of purpose,
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.120]   identity, and connections.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.160]   We wanna build meaning into our life.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.720]   To do that, we build a stable financial plan,
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.680]   and then we practice risk medication, right?
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.000]   What we're really doing is trying to protect ourselves
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.240]   against the unknown risks,
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.040]   like you'll suddenly lose your job,
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.000]   like an economic downturn,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.120]   like a healthcare crisis or problem.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.440]   Like all of these things,
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.800]   we wanna create that dining room table
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.920]   that's gonna support us
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.080]   so that we can withstand whatever trauma,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.160]   whatever black swan,
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.400]   or I call them white swan events that happen, right?
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.960]   These events that,
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.520]   a black swan event is a totally unexpected event
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.640]   that can really ruin our financial lives.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.840]   White swan events are events
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.920]   that can ruin our financial lives,
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.120]   but they're not totally unexpected,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.680]   like a healthcare problem, right?
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.560]   People get sick and end up spending a lot of money
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.280]   on healthcare, it's common.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.840]   A divorce, right?
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.120]   The whole point of all this
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.040]   is to build a solid financial foundation
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.680]   so you can mitigate your risk
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.200]   and withstand the winds of change
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.360]   that are gonna affect you and your financial plan
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   so that you can continue using that money
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.600]   to do what it's supposed to do,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   which is give you the space and time
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.900]   to do meaningful things.
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.460]   - To its core, would it be fair to say,
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.820]   a lot of times people think of the financial plan
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.820]   as what do I do with my savings?
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.380]   And your point is,
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.380]   it's not, you have your income,
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.620]   you have your savings,
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.820]   but then you might also have some other assets you own,
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.860]   whether it's a business,
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.260]   whether it's real estate,
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.700]   and you might also have not just your job,
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.100]   but your other income.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.780]   And the more you can start to build
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.580]   different buckets of money
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.460]   that aren't just your savings,
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.700]   the more stable you can be.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.100]   But at some point,
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.220]   you mentioned the dining room table with four,
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.060]   at some point,
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.780]   maybe you don't need your eighth, ninth, 10th, 11th, 12th.
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.940]   If you can get four,
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.520]   which if one falls off three is still a little stable,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.660]   four kind of solid pieces of financial wealth, if you will,
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.340]   whether it's a job or,
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.660]   that's kind of a place to strive for.
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.060]   - Yeah, perfect is the enemy of good.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.300]   I love these posts on social media
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.220]   where you have someone in the personal finance world
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.020]   that says, "I've got nine forms of income."
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.900]   And they love to say the different side hustles
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.780]   and the difference.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.620]   That's great.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.380]   But for the majority of us,
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.540]   four or five revenue streams that are stable,
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.660]   that are diversified,
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.260]   that are uncorrelated,
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.660]   like I don't wanna go too far,
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.560]   but how can we start building these streams
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.880]   and be thoughtful about it, right?
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.560]   So, okay, I'm gonna retire.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.700]   Do I have a pension?
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.860]   Do I have a 401k
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.620]   that I can start taking distributions from?
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.400]   Do I wanna set up an insurance policy
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.780]   that'll pay me like a spia?
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.860]   Like there are different ways of doing this
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.780]   so that when one revenue stream drops off,
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.500]   you can create another revenue stream.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.220]   And therefore, again, you can protect yourself from change
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.280]   because that's ultimately,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.700]   we have no control over change.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.340]   We have only control over the best planning we can do
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.960]   and then what we do with our lives.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.220]   - So that's the planning piece.
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.700]   But you do talk a little bit about how
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.700]   one of the ways to tackle your finances is.
