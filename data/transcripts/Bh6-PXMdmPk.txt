[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.920]   J. Cal, you look a little grifty.
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.720]   Feel okay?
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.760]   Me?
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.400]   I'm great.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.880]   I'm great.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.400]   You look half a milli richer today.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.760]   What's it like to be half a milli richer?
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.920]   J. Cal, you look like a failed hostage taker.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.800]   Laugh it up, boys.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.760]   Laugh it up, boys.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.480]   Laugh it up, boys.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.680]   When you see my other projects drop, you're going to be crying again, okay?
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.560]   I can't wait.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.400]   Why don't you take yes for an answer, J. Cal?
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.720]   I've taken yes for an answer.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.240]   Welcome to the All In Podcast with three miserable rich bastards
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.520]   who pull up the ladder behind him.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.400]   Do you want to explain why it took us a month to produce a new episode, J. Cal?
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.120]   What about the-- hold on a second.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.080]   Attorney.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.520]   Let me give you guys the TL;DR.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.000]   J. Cal thought the All In Pod was his, and then he realized it wasn't.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.840]   No.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.040]   If you guys want to go, there we go.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.440]   There.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.120]   I'm totally transparent.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.480]   I requested, I requested to own 6% more of the
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.720]   All In Podcast.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.000]   No, no, no.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.120]   Back up to the summit.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.880]   Back up to when you wanted to kick me off the show.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.800]   No, back up before that where we--
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.280]   Oh my God.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.240]   Are we really doing this?
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.360]   Yeah, we're going to do it.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.240]   Okay.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.200]   If you want to do it, we do it.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.520]   We can't talk about this for 45 minutes because what happened then--
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.400]   It's so boring.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.720]   So boring.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.120]   We planned the summit.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.000]   So boring.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.200]   We planned the summit.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.720]   J. Cal doesn't like how I was concerned about the summit, and I bitched at him, and you
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.320]   know, I was negative to him.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.760]   Finished the summit, and J. Cal wants to kick me off the show.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.560]   Yes.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.120]   Brad Gerstner, Bill Gurley would have higher ratings.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.840]   Here comes the bullying.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.480]   People think it was me.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.000]   It was me and J. Cal getting into it.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.720]   It wasn't.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.280]   It was actually, it started with Friedberg and J. Cal getting into it.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.400]   J. Cal wanted me off the show.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.360]   All right.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.240]   Do I get to explain the series of events or no?
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.400]   Go ahead.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.280]   You wanted me off the show.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.560]   True or false, J. Cal?
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:51.200]   I felt that if Friedberg wasn't enjoying his time here and was going to constantly complain
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.240]   every week about every detail of why the show's not good, there was always the option for
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.200]   him to maybe do half the shows and have Brad Gerstner do half the shows or have Bill Gurley
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.000]   rotate in.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.360]   And so if he was going to be miserable all the time and worried about the show, I gave
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.480]   him the option to have somebody else take his spot.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.760]   Did you or did you not say that this is your show, you're the leader, and you wanted me
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.480]   off the show?
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.200]   I never said that.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.560]   Nor would I say that.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.280]   I don't need to say that.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.440]   You said you could summarily replace any of us.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   Effectively, you acted like we all worked for you.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.400]   I never said that.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.960]   Sax, I don't think Schumat's replaceable, just for the record.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.200]   So.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.080]   That's true.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.520]   He does think that.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.000]   I do not think Schumat's replaceable.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.360]   Friedberg, I do think, I mean, I could pull up the Brad Gerstner episodes.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.480]   I think they have slightly more views.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.840]   So, but people love you.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.320]   So we keep you.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.680]   But J. Cal told my mom and my wife that he thought I was replaceable on the show.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.880]   Guys, I would like to jump in by just summarizing this so that we can move on.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.040]   So basically what happened was we had an agreement that it was 25% each.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.880]   There was a moment where J. Cal believed that he deserved more.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.920]   We had to sort through a lot of the underlying issues that caused him to believe that we got to a
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.360]   good consensus.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.400]   We now have a signed agreement that governs how the show and other things around the show and
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.960]   offshoots of the show will work.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.640]   We are 25% equal partners and now we can move on.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.920]   So enough for the bitching.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.480]   Let's go.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.280]   All good.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.400]   And I love you all.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.280]   I love you all too.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.080]   I love you all too.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.160]   To be clear, my position, I do feel like this needs to be out here was if we're going to
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.520]   make it into a media company, my request was, listen, I think I own, I should have 10% more
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.760]   equity and I'll go to work every day and do the work.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.880]   You guys can just show up.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.000]   You guys agreed to that.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And then you guys said you don't want to do it.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.280]   And I said, okay, fine.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.840]   So here we are.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.960]   We're back at square one.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.000]   So let's just get to work.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.080]   We just want to do a pod and we just want to talk.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.680]   There's not going to be any more summits.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.960]   There's not going to be any business here.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.760]   It's just a pod.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.640]   I have other events.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.880]   I do.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.600]   I have other pods.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.320]   I do.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.640]   If I want to get paid, I'll do them over there.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.120]   And here it's just a pod that you see every week.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.000]   So let's get into it.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.840]   Everybody wants to talk about markets.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.400]   Oh, by the way, if you guys want your intros, that's 1% each.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.680]   Intros go do it.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.960]   Those are 1% each.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.840]   So when you guys are willing to pay me my 1% additional equity,
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.640]   you get the intros.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.120]   And when you want the all in summit 2023, that's another one.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.040]   We're going to get an invoice each week from J Cal now.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.800]   You're going to get it's going to be prorated monthly.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.920]   It's going to be 0.8% equity per month vested.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.360]   I just think it's so fascinating that we went through all of this.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.200]   You know, I don't know, storming wrong or whatever.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.880]   This this like a month of non taping and you know, and this like all this turmoil in our
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.360]   relationship.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.520]   So you.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.200]   Could get an extra 1% from us.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880]   2% each 31%.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.120]   I believe I should just so you know, I do this for a living.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.520]   And if I do extra work, I believe I should.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.160]   Uh, and if you want me to be the de facto CEO of this, then I should get a little extra.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.880]   We don't want that.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.520]   And you don't want that.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.080]   So that's fine.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.080]   That's fine.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.280]   This is just going to be a project.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.480]   We do it every week.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.160]   And then all your griffs, whatever, you know, you're spinning out from the production board
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.360]   or whatever copycat app you're making, you can fucking do.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.160]   As an as a side grift.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.640]   Here we go.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.760]   Oh, do the intros.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.480]   Let's get going.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.720]   Come on.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.040]   Let's go.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.720]   No, there's no zero interest.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.440]   No interest.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.160]   Intros are out.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.440]   Wait, what about hey, everybody?
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.240]   Hey, everybody.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.520]   I'll do a hey, everybody.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.320]   Hey, everybody on the house.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.960]   Hey, everybody.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.600]   Hey, everybody.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.160]   Welcome to us.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.000]   Is that free for you?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.160]   Yeah, it's free for you.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.960]   Let your winners ride.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.840]   Rain man, David Sacks.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.200]   And it said we open source it to the fans.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.160]   And they've just gone crazy.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.720]   Love you.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.040]   I love you.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.280]   Best.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.680]   I love you.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.880]   Queen of Kinwa.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.440]   I'm going all in.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.920]   Hey, everybody.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.400]   Welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.280]   We're back for episode 84 with me, of course, the Sultan of Science, the Prince of Panic
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.920]   Attacks, the Queen of Kinwa himself, David Freedberg.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.640]   How you doing, buddy?
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.320]   Great to be here.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.960]   Great to be here.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.360]   All right.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.680]   I miss you.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.000]   And?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.760]   Can you feel the tension?
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.960]   There's still a lot of tension.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.600]   There's still tension.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   There's still a little tension there.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.840]   J.K.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.280]   L and I will be hanging out tomorrow night.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.400]   We'll make it.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.040]   Have you guys resolved?
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.960]   I'm cool.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.600]   I'm cool with Freedberg.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.560]   I mean, I bought him dinner.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.000]   I think he did buy me a wonderful dinner.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.640]   Oh, my Lord.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.440]   After the Warriors game.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.160]   Shout out to the Warriors.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.120]   All right.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.520]   And of course, with us is the Rain Man himself, David Sachs.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.160]   How you doing, buddy?
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.280]   Good.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.000]   You ready to go?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.760]   Don't try and deflect this thing onto me.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.520]   I was only tangentially involved.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.480]   Says the guy who spent 72 hours on...
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.920]   I wrote the contract.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.800]   I wrote a very fair contract so that we can move forward.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.880]   And then you proceeded to break it in the first 15 minutes.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.880]   By slandering me and disparaging me.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.120]   But okay.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.080]   Oh, come on.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.440]   That was good for ratings.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.160]   Good for ratings.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.720]   Yes.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.080]   I thought your meme was pretty great.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.880]   He did the meme.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.960]   The two buttons of the superhero.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.760]   That was good.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.800]   And I was like, Jason.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.320]   That was good.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.120]   Making jokes.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.320]   Breaking the non-disparaging clause.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.160]   And then, of course, the dictator himself.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.000]   From some undisclosed location in a European city.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.920]   I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.360]   At Jomatha Palihapitiya.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.240]   Welcome back, boys.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.960]   Episode 84.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.680]   What's up, boys?
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.720]   All right.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.320]   Well, since we last convened.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.160]   Let's get it on.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.400]   Yes.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.320]   The all-in summit is finished.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.400]   All the episodes have been released, including Pomerolaki yesterday.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.920]   And here we go.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.000]   The markets are in complete turmoil.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   SPY down 21% year to date.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.560]   Dow's down 17% year to date.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.200]   As Saxis pointed out, that is not representative of what happened to growth stocks at the same
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.440]   time.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.760]   And the May CPI went up and it was at 8.6.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.560]   We also got to 70%.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.880]   We're at 75 basis point rate hike.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.040]   Who wants to start here?
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.480]   Jomatha, I mean, it's market.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.000]   So maybe I'll just dump it to you first and then we'll go around the horn to Sax and then
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.400]   Friedberg.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.000]   Well, there's a lot to say.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.680]   So bear with me for a second.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:43.040]   But the thing that you have to do before you talk about what is happening now, I think
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.640]   it's probably useful to go back and you have to really start at the end of the great financial
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.120]   crisis.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.400]   And the reason is there was a bunch of people.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.360]   People coming out of the GFC who confused what the US government and some European governments
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.320]   were doing.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.600]   At the time, there was the risk of a huge financial contagion.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   So the US stepped in and the Federal Reserve started to use their balance sheet to buy
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.480]   toxic assets.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.880]   The ECB did that.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.080]   I think Japan did that as well.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.280]   Anyways, a bunch of banks did it.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.880]   I mean, a bunch of governments did it.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.280]   Then there was this body of pseudoscientists.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.240]   Tiffica.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.280]   You know, a bunch of economists who coined this thing called modern monetary theory,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:33.680]   which basically said, hey, you can keep printing money and introducing it into the economy
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.840]   to smooth things out and to actually drive long term growth.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.200]   And it turns out that a bunch of government officials fell for it.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:50.080]   And if you fast forward to 2022, so 14 years later, you know, governments around the world
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   had printed something.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.800]   They had printed something that was a huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge,
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.360]   huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.760]   $35 trillion of money into the economy that should have never been there.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.880]   So the thing to remember is like we have not necessarily just been obfuscating true supply
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.760]   demand in the last six or eight months when we've been talking about a recession or inflation.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.960]   We've been actually doing it since 2008.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.960]   It's just that it's been building up in the system.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.640]   So one of the things that we have to realize is that all of that money somehow needs to
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.920]   get destroyed in some way.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.960]   Shape or form.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.880]   If the true economic equilibrium is meant to be found, what is true supply?
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.880]   What is true demand in the absence of government sloshing money around trying to prop up things
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.640]   that should not be propped up or buying votes or all the grifts that these folks have engaged
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.920]   in in the last decade and a half have to get undone.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.160]   So that's the backdrop.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.280]   So if you think about taking $30 trillion out of the global economy, you know, you're
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:51.760]   talking about.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.720]   Almost, you know, I think it's 85 trillion is the world GDP.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.520]   So like, you know, it's almost half of an entire year's worth of global GDP.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.480]   It's going to take three years, probably of the slow, meticulous, you know, running off of money,
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.320]   you know, not reintroducing new money.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.760]   So it seems like we're at the beginning of the beginning of something that's going to
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.800]   be long and drawn out.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.640]   Now that's separate from and that's separate from whether we're in a recession or not.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.400]   That's just the bear market that we're in.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.600]   Right.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:28.800]   And so you have to look at asset prices today as a microcosm of a much larger trend that
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   has to be about fake money pushing asset prices up and now taking all that fake money out
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.440]   and finding out what the real price of something is.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.000]   And I just don't think that takes six months.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.760]   So for all the people that were, you know, fingers crossed, hoping that this would be
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.720]   the end of it.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.840]   Fed raises 75.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.640]   We're done with this.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.000]   They're going to raise 75 more.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.040]   I just think that's not how it's probably going to be.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.440]   It's going to take.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.120]   You know, 2436 months.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.480]   That may mean the bottom doesn't happen for another 18 months.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:04.400]   So I think it's a we're in for a lot of choppy market action.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:10.240]   Sacks three asset bubbles, clearly all, you know, being impacted.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.440]   We had stocks.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.440]   Looks like that story was pretty violent.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.480]   Then we had crypto this last two or three weeks have been absolutely insane in terms
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:20.640]   of.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:29.360]   That asset bubble and now record high inventories for homes record sales are now dipping below
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.760]   the average of the last 20 years and we're seeing mortgage origination just absolutely
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.960]   get crushed 6% mortgages just a couple of months ago.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.560]   It was 2.x for some folks.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.600]   So when you look at those three asset bubbles, do you buy chamats?
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.320]   Hey, we're going to see even more deprecation these for another 18 months possibly or do
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:50.960]   you think we've.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.880]   Taken such crazy action.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.480]   This has come down so violently that we're now bouncing along the bottom, bouncing along
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.160]   the bottom or 18 months of more pain.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.640]   Well, the stock market, especially growth stocks may have taken the majority of the
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.000]   carnage, but you're right.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.160]   There are other asset classes and I think we're going to see the carnage start to rotate
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.800]   into those.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.080]   So you're right.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:16.080]   If you look at residential real estate now, the prices are at the highest they've been
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.800]   relative to median income since something like 2006 2007 before.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   That sort of great real estate crash that precipitated the great recession of 2008.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.320]   So I think there are going to be more shoes to drop.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.440]   I just want to build on Chumash point about root causes here.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.920]   Milton Friedman once said that there's nothing quite so permanent as a temporary government
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.320]   program.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.440]   The temporary government program was quantitative easing.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.360]   We had this great recession of 2008 that could have turned into a depression.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.520]   They broke the glass in case of emergency.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.640]   They started this QE, which is basically the government intervening to buy bonds in the
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:50.960]   market.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.240]   They had never done that before and they loaded up their balance sheet.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   The crazy thing is that program was still continuing until last year.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.640]   Why?
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.480]   I mean, it was like on cruise control.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.160]   And so last year, it was continuing until last month and countries like Europe are still
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.120]   doing it.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.240]   9% inflation in Europe and they're still buying bonds.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:10.480]   Right.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.000]   So you go back to last year, the Fed bought 54% of the government's debt, despite the
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.480]   fact that the economy was growing at like 5% GDP, that it was bouncing back.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.000]   The Fed was bouncing back really strongly from COVID that you had the stock market at
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.880]   all time highs and yet they were still intervening with this massive QE.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.720]   And then when we got the surprise 5.1% inflation print last summer, they didn't stop QE till
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.680]   the end of Q1.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.960]   So you're right.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.520]   They kept basically printing money and it's still going on and that's created massive
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.640]   distortions in the economy.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.280]   Now so the Fed, I would say, is the number one culprit here and Jay Powell is the number
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.160]   one culprit.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.320]   But the number two culprit is the Biden administration.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.840]   And I think Biden did three things very early on in the first few months of his presidency
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.920]   to effectively tank his presidency.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.560]   Number one, he canceled our energy independence on his first day in office, canceling the
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.960]   Keystone pipeline and making it much harder to drill.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.520]   And of course, energy inflation is the one factor in this sort of overall inflation.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.280]   Number two, he pushed through that last $2 trillion of stimulus on straight party lines,
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.160]   the ARP, the American Rescue Plan, after Larry Summers said economists in his own
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.120]   party said this is going to create inflation, don't do it.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.520]   And then the third thing is, and no one really talks about this, is that Biden could have
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.920]   used diplomacy in 2021 to basically find an off ramp to this Ukraine crisis before it
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.760]   turned into a full fledged war.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.280]   And if you listen to the economists, the international development economists like Jeffrey Sachs,
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.240]   he basically says that Biden polled his cabinet and said, listen, should we negotiate and
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.600]   compromise with the Russians?
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.480]   They all said no.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.000]   And Biden handed down the order.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.720]   We will not compromise with the Russians.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:58.400]   So now we have this massive war in Ukraine that's fueling food and energy inflation.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.240]   It's going to take his presidency.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.440]   And I don't even think there was any debate in his cabinet about this.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.880]   We may not be negotiating against Russia, but we're enabling them to print enormous
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.000]   surpluses, meaning I don't know if you guys saw, but there was an article today.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.840]   Janet Yellen is traveling around basically convincing folks to
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:27.600]   not include Russian oil from a bunch of import bans so that these Russian oil tankers can be
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.640]   insured.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.040]   Why?
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.120]   So that they can sell this oil to places like China and India, et cetera.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.640]   The rubles at a five time, five year high, the rubles at a five year high.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.400]   We push for all these sanctions.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.000]   Europe gets on board and says, we're going to do it and we're going to take the lumps.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.840]   And then we go around Europe and basically say, well, we kind of want to fight this proxy war,
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.480]   but at the same time, we want to try to fix inflation.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.680]   And we didn't mean to cause this.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.120]   And it's completely disorganized what's happening.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.440]   Okay.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:59.120]   So if you had six minutes in the pool for when Sachs would blame Biden for the economy, you win.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.640]   Well, who do you blame?
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.000]   Of course the president is responsible.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.480]   We talked about quantitative easing starting in 2008.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.080]   So that goes over a couple of presidents.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.440]   And I guess the question I would have for you, Sachs, is how much of the spending,
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.760]   the free willing spending, you know, was from the previous administration?
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.760]   Overspending is a bipartisan problem.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.880]   There's no question about it.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.640]   I just want to make sure that we point that out.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.520]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.840]   And Republicans only seem to find their principles on spending
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.040]   when there's a Democrat in the White House.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.160]   I totally get it.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.120]   And I would like to see more fiscal responsibility, regardless of which party is in power.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.760]   And I'd like to see the Republicans be less hypocritical in their principles on this.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.440]   But look, here's the thing.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.080]   The economy was bouncing back strongly last year.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.880]   And Biden still pushed for this last $2 trillion of spending.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.720]   And then $1.2 trillion more in infrastructure.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.240]   Thank God we didn't do that.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.400]   And then remember the $4 trillion of Build Back Better where Manchin saved them from themselves.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:48.960]   Exactly.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.360]   I mean, what would
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   it have looked like?
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.640]   Freeberg, you haven't spoken yet.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:17:01.200]   Thoughts on, you know, this, these asset bubbles, I guess, and then the buying of the bonds
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   seemed completely unnecessary for some period of time.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:09.440]   If we are acting as the 50% plus buyer of bonds, what kind of distortion does that create
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.000]   in the market?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.160]   Because if the government's competing against other people in the marketplace to buy those
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.800]   bonds, how could they possibly be priced correctly?
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   Let's just be very careful about our framing.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.200]   There's
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:26.720]   the US Treasury, which issues bonds and raises capital on behalf of the US government for
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.600]   spending programs.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.480]   Then there's the central bank, the Federal Reserve.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:39.360]   And our central bank's job is to, number one, maintain liquidity in the capital markets
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:45.200]   so that businesses can invest in growing their products and growing their businesses and
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.040]   the economy grows while not providing too much.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.040]   And the second thing is that the federal reserve is not the only one that's going to
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:51.600]   be able to do that.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.880]   It's going to be the federal reserve that's going to be able to do that.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.880]   And the third thing is that the federal reserve is going to be able to do that.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.720]   And the fourth thing is that the federal reserve is going to be able to do that.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.000]   And the fifth thing is that the federal reserve is going to be able to do that.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.760]   And the sixth thing is that the federal reserve is going to be able to do that.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.040]   And the sixth thing is that the federal reserve is going to be able to do that.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.840]   And the seventh thing is that the federal reserve is going to be able to do that.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.120]   And the eighth thing is that the federal reserve is going to be able to do that.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.400]   And the sixth thing is that the federal reserve is going to be able to do that.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.920]   is to provide a stated goal of Jerome Powell, in particular right now, this changes over time,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   but generally, the intention of the Federal Reserve is to make liquidity to make cash available
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:22.320]   to banks, who ultimately make it available to businesses, in such a way that there's enough
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.840]   cash in the system, that the businesses grow, and that people have capital to invest in growth,
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.760]   while keeping inflation at 2%. So their long term target is 2% inflation.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.720]   And it's also correct me if I'm wrong, making sure that there's enough cash to support economic
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:43.040]   growth. So remember, last year, you'll remember Stan Druckenmiller was very public about how insane
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.880]   it was that the Federal Reserve was still buying bonds. And so there's one way to introduce cash
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.360]   into the system is to make cash available as a loan to banks. And then those, you know,
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.560]   banks use that money to loan to businesses, and it makes its way through the economy.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.160]   Another way is for the Federal Reserve to step in and actually buy bonds,
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.680]   freeing up the money,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:01.760]   John.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.520]   that other people would be otherwise using to buy bonds to go and invest in other things. So they're
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.720]   effectively forcing liquidity into the market by taking bonds out of the market. And last summer,
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.440]   or Q2 of last year, Druckenmiller was pounding the table saying, guys,
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:22.560]   the economic indicators on how quickly the markets are how quickly the economy is growing, relative
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.120]   to how much inflation there is, indicates that we should stop buying bonds, and we should stop
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.680]   injecting liquidity into the markets. This makes no sense. It is nonsensical. And there
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.240]   was no strong point of view from the Fed at the time, other than there was uncertainty about the
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.160]   bounce back of the from the recession from COVID. There was uncertainty about what else was happening
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.360]   in the economy, and yada, yada. But the numbers, the economic indicators were showing very clearly,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.560]   the economy is growing at a robust pace, low unemployment, and inflation is starting to pick
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:56.080]   up. Holy crap, it's time to cool it off. And the Fed made a judgment call and their judgment call
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.040]   really kind of was to keep going. And then we end up in this massive runaway inflationary problem,
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.400]   where if you keep too much liquidity in the system for too long, you have inflation,
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.840]   even if you have economic growth. And now by pulling the money out of the system super,
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:14.880]   super fast, we reduce the inflationary effects potentially. But we take the economy because now
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.920]   all this money coming out of the market means people are spending less and buying less and
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.600]   businesses have less to borrow, the borrowing costs are high. And then that that's that's the
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.360]   big vacuum. Hold on, let me go to Chamath and then Sachs. I just want to say one thing, the rate the
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.760]   rate at which we pull the money out, which has had to be really, really fast over the last few weeks,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.960]   can cause a recession.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.360]   And that's the biggest concern right now is will that actually trigger a massive recession
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.400]   or not that everyone's watching?
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.040]   So Chamath, I guess, one of the things we need to clarify here is the actual mandate of the Fed.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.960]   I was under the understanding that the Fed really was there to make sure of maximum
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.240]   employment and that, you know, low interest loans were available. And price stability. These are the
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.600]   were the stated goals for a long time,
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:00.480]   not low interest rates, capital capital is available to grow without exceeding inflation of
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:00.880]   2%.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.680]   That's okay. So maximum employment, price stability was also in the original
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.880]   GDP growth, because remember, we can't ever pay our debt if our GDP is not growing,
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.520]   okay, while minimizing while keeping inflation below 2%.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.600]   Chamath, whatever point you want to make, feel free to make but also I was just wanting to know
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:21.040]   from you, where did the Fed go wrong with their mandate, if at all here, because we do have maximum
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.000]   employment, we have out of control price stability.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.800]   Look, here's the thing you I think we have to also be sensitive to the fact that the Fed operates on
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:37.760]   a certain class of data. And that data in the 21st century is pretty pathetic. Nick, you can probably
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.320]   find this, but there was an article, I think it was in the New York Times, that really walked
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.640]   through how CPI is calculated. And it's a bunch of people that work for the government that walk
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.600]   around with iPads, building relationships with local businesses and all these random places all
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.320]   around the country, and asking them to, you know, chit chat for 15 minutes and do these surveys.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.720]   Now, you would have thought that in 2023, or 2020,
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:07.360]   what the government would have said to, you know, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, all the payment
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.800]   rails, the banks and stripe is send me a feed in the following structured way so that I can actually
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.160]   have an absolute precise sense of inflation, because inflation really only occurs when a good
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.920]   or a service trades hands for money, right? And you calculate what did that thing trade at the day
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.800]   before and what is a trade for today. So you could get an absolute precise sense of it. Instead, we
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.640]   do this random sampling.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.280]   thing and subjective humans, etc.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:39.920]   So if you read this article, your takeaway will be, oh my god, this is very rickety. And it drives
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.960]   an enormous hammer that we use to try to manage the economy. That's the first thing. I think you
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:51.120]   need to buckle your seatbelt because the next three, four or five months of CPI will probably
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:59.280]   be very, very bad. 789%. Why? There are a handful of components that have gotten completely runaway.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.960]   The biggest one is rent. And so rent works on a three month lag, we're going to reintroduce what
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:11.440]   the true owners equivalent rent is into CPI. So we can already forecast that CPI going up.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.080]   Oil is at 105 bucks a barrel. Russia is basically trying to break the bank
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:23.680]   of Europe by now messing with their nat gas supplies. The German energy minister yesterday
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.880]   said that if that happens, it could be a contagion equivalent to Lehman Brothers with respect to
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.480]   energy. When you look at the energy supply, you can see that the energy supply is going to be
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.600]   in the same position as the oil price. But when you play all of these things out, what you have is,
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:41.200]   unfortunately, rampant runaway costs that really have no mechanism to get back and check in the
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.800]   absence of some real governmental changes. Our policy on this Ukraine Russia war, you know,
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   how we intend to sort of work or cooperate or fight with China. All of these things have to get
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:58.480]   solved. So in the absence of that, prices are going to continue to go up. And so what does the
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.400]   Fed do? How does it operate? How does it manage the economy? And what does it do? Well, the Fed
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.200]   is going to be doing a lot of work. And so what it's going to do is it's going to be doing a lot of
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.000]   work. And so what it's going to do is it's going to be doing a lot of work. And so what it's going to
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   do is it's going to be doing a lot of work. And so what it's going to do is it's going to do a lot of work.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.480]   little credibility it has left, when there's eight and 9% inflation prints, and saying we think we're
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:14.960]   done for right now, you can't do that. So they will overcorrect, because there's just going to be
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:24.000]   so much pressure for them to act. All roads, I think lead to lower equity prices. And I think
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.320]   what David said astutely is we've seen the first wave. But now it has to be done. And so what we're
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:30.960]   doing is we're doing a lot of work. And so what it's going to do is it's going to be doing a lot of
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.440]   work. And so what it's going to do is we're doing a lot of work. And so what it's going to do is we're
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:31.760]   going to do a lot of work. And so what it's going to do is we're doing a lot of work. And so what we're
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.360]   doing is we're doing a lot of work. And so what it's going to do is we're doing a lot of work. And so
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.480]   we have gotten totally drunk on debt as a country. One of the most obvious places where we've been
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:47.440]   serving alcohol far too late into the night is in the financing of all these private equity leverage
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:53.040]   buyouts. Right? These are dangerous, these are sketchy companies that are sort of like, you know,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:59.200]   teetering on insolvency at times, where private equity comes in levers up the balance sheet with
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.400]   debt, they price it right to the edge of what's legally allowed or what's financeable, and then
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:10.240]   they go do it. But that's all assuming the economy continues to grow. And so if all of a sudden you
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:16.560]   have some recessionary forces or prices go up and earnings don't, you'll have you know, a contagion
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:21.680]   in the debt markets, you could have a contagion in the commodity market. So we're dealing with some
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.200]   really real boundary conditions. I mean, real estate,
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.120]   most of most Americans have most of their net worth tied up in real estate. And if we
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.680]   see a 30 30% correction in real estate, it could be a real problem, particularly with rising interest
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.200]   rates, inability to refinance
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:41.280]   sacks, the dual mandate is hey, keep inflation 2%. And then keep the unemployment rate reasonable,
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.400]   the unemployment rates amazing with still so many jobs out there, even with these layoffs. In fact,
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.080]   one might argue we made too many jobs available to the point at which people maybe aren't working as
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:58.320]   much or just, you know, under working and not taking advantage of these amazing jobs out there.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.040]   Where do you see
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:05.680]   this going sacks now, that we can't seem to get inflation under control. And people are looking
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:12.560]   at their 401ks, they feel a lot poorer, but is the demand side gone yet? Have have consumers decided,
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.560]   I'm not going to buy the next house, I'm not going on this vacation. $6 gas makes no sense. $7 gas
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.160]   makes no sense. I'm not going to go on this weekend excursion. I'm staying home.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:28.960]   Yeah, I mean, look, consumer confidence just had the biggest drop, I think in 40 or 50 years. We
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.560]   if you look at like, right track wrong track polling for the country, only something like 24%
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.280]   believes that the country's on the right track right now. If you pull people, are we in a
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   recession? And they don't look at like, you know, the quarter over quarter growth, they just look at
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.880]   what they're feeling. 56% of the country says we're already in recession. It's about 70% Republicans,
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:55.760]   about 50% Democrats. So the country is already hurting people already feeling it. And this is
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.880]   psychological sacks, or are they actually making decisions?
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.080]   Now to spend less?
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.280]   Well, I think it's both. I mean, you start with the real inflation, and people feel it.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.560]   And they also hear about it in the media. And then they start to adjust their,
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.320]   their decisions. And this is the problem with fixing. Yeah, this is a problem with fixing
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.040]   an inflation problem is that is based on expectations. So once people start to expect
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.480]   inflation, then businesses have to start operating as if there's gonna be an inflation
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.880]   rate next year. So they have to start raising prices. And it's actually very hard
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.800]   to put the horse back in the barn. And this is why I think,
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.680]   I think the Fed is probably more likely to overshoot on raising rates is because if they
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.840]   really want to stop inflation now, they really have to slam on the brakes. And then that's going
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.480]   to lead to a recession. And if they don't, then we end up with like a chronic sort of
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.240]   stagflationary situation where you get lower growth and inflation persists. So it's a bunch
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.320]   of bad options right now. And I think to the point Freeberg was making earlier, you know,
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:57.920]   this Ray Dalio piece that he just published as a blog on LinkedIn, he said, Look, what you want is
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.720]   a Fed that's going to be able to keep inflation going. And that's what I think is going to be
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:58.800]   the best way to do that. And I think that's what I think is going to be the best way to do that.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:05.040]   That is alert at the wheel, and gently applies the accelerator or the brakes based on what's
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:10.000]   happening. And instead, what we had is the Fed was asleep at the wheel, they should have started
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.240]   reacting gently to inflation last summer. Instead, they waited nine months, and now they're slamming
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.200]   on the brakes. And this is a bunch of bad options. I think we you know, we are going to have a
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.920]   recession the way this can make one suggestion. I want to put this out there because I sent it
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   on our text and I anyone that's listening,
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:35.680]   in DC, please think about how we can change the way the Federal Reserve operates. But it doesn't
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:43.280]   make sense to have humans with subjectivity, applying their subjectivity to a set of as
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.440]   Chamath pointed out infrequent data that comes in chunks and comes in spurts,
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:53.360]   and only having a mechanism of changing rates by 25% each month, or sorry, 25 basis points
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.560]   once a month, we should have continuous real time monitoring of
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:06.000]   economic data. And software or AI or some sort of informed set of models should then predict
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.440]   what inflation and economic growth rates will be as that data comes in react in real time.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.960]   And on a daily basis, we should be adjusting the overnight rate in a one basis point increment.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:22.320]   So we can have the ability to more quickly, more efficiently and in a higher resolution way.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.600]   Yeah, smooth it out a smoother way in a higher resolution way make these adjustments.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.480]   It's silly that we're still operating the way we did in a pre digital age,
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.840]   as it is with a lot of industries and a lot of bureaucracy. But in this case,
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.160]   it's particularly prudent, and it's becoming particularly important and relevant,
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.680]   as we're seeing right now with the stagflation risk that we're facing, where we could have
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.800]   massive inflation and recession at the same time. Because if we had made smaller adjustments
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.600]   every day for a period of time, as these economic data indicated that we should be making them more
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.560]   quickly, we would not be in this problem. And I don't think that having humans and their judgment
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.400]   should necessarily be the way that we drive. But listen, we don't need them making daily
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.480]   adjustments. I don't think the Fed can fine tune an outcome like that. I just think that they
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:06.000]   can't be asleep at the wheel for nine months. I mean, we should have AI running this
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.600]   friggin thing. I mean, what's listen, I don't I actually don't think when you when you said that,
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.520]   you know, Congress needs to somehow change that the way the Fed does business, I actually think
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:19.040]   that the Fed has the correct mandate, which is the dual mandate of considering inflation
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:24.080]   and unemployment. We shouldn't be basically junking that up by adding a bunch of mandates.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.320]   And actually, the administration has been trying to add mandates, they basically gave the Fed
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.280]   a mandate around climate change, they gave them a mandate. Don't change the mandate.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.040]   They have to try to change
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.280]   multivariable complex, the tools, the tools to change.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:44.160]   Yeah, right. We really want to focus Fed and I think the administration has been politicizing
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.240]   the Fed by giving them a bunch of mandates. Look, if you want to pursue those policies,
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:53.680]   do it at HHS, do it in the Interior Department. Don't basically confuse the Fed and make them
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.240]   pursue climate change or equity or what have you. I mean, that is just bad. But that is not
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.360]   their remit, right? Their remit is controlling inflation. I really think this just comes down
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.840]   to the fact that for nine months, they sat on their hands and ignored the inflation evidence.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.400]   Remember this word transitory? You know, we heard so much last year about inflation being
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:17.520]   transitory. How'd they know that? You know, why didn't they start rethinking this quantitative
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.440]   easing? The headline from the Wall Street Journal says it all how the inflation rate is measured.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:28.160]   477 government workers at grocery stores. Yeah, software should be taking
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.720]   data from different feeds and software can learn. I don't I don't really care. And what are the
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.040]   predictors of inflation? And what are the predictors of growth? And make a recommendation?
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.040]   I don't agree with you that it needs to be real time. In fact, I think it would do more harm than
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:46.880]   good. But I do think that we can know these things without sampling in such a porous way.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.520]   And you know, you can work with private companies to give you the feed of data
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:58.080]   to allow you to do it. And now you know, we're going to look, we've had a system of overcorrect
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:03.360]   ing and undercorrecting for years. The problem is the stakes get higher and higher as the economy
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.840]   grows and becomes more complicated. And we have more leverage, and we have more leverage and we
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.880]   have more industries that are leveraged and more asset classes that are leveraged like housing.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.960]   Because by even a few points, you could take everything.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:22.720]   I also want to tell you guys a quick story. One of the most interesting canaries in the coal mine
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:28.000]   of all of this was two days ago. And what happened to Facebook,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.040]   and this sort of ties a lot of this stuff together in terms of like economics, inflation,
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:41.920]   asset prices, equities, tech, we should we can try to talk about non sort of, you know, big tech.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:47.120]   But the everybody was saying, Oh, gosh, the market's gonna rip on the open, you know,
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.840]   we were closed for Juneteenth. And then on Tuesday, the market, you know, the S&P was
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:57.920]   up like 250 basis points 2.5%. And the Nasdaq was also up, you know, call it maybe three
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:03.200]   hundred basis points, roughly. But Facebook was down like 400 points, right? So it's a big spread.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.320]   And why is that? And I was like, this makes no sense to me what is going on with this price
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.200]   action. Everything was up, Apple was up, Google was up. And so I called around. And you know,
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.720]   I was like, why is this happening? And this is the best explanation I got.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:22.880]   When you look at who the incremental buyer is, in the stock market,
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.200]   it tends to give you a sense of whether prices can go up, or will continue to go down.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:37.120]   And the poorest informed buyer tends to be retail. And the most informed buyer tends to be these very
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:44.320]   large institutional hedge funds. Right? So there's a spectrum. And Facebook is an example of one of
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:52.560]   the big tech that is poorly owned by retail. So it's mostly owned by smart money. And the case
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.440]   that smart money makes for owning Facebook is that it's got an extremely cheap price to earnings
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:57.760]   ratio. And that's why it's so important to have a big tech. And that's why it's so important to have
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.000]   a big tech. And that's why it's so important to have a big tech. And that's why it's so important
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.280]   to have a big tech. And that's why it's so important to have a big tech. So you must own it.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:05.360]   And what they said was that they, you know, looking at the tea leaves of consumer demand,
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:10.880]   what they actually re underwrote was that actually, it's not that the price to earnings
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:17.040]   was cheap, it's at the E in PE was just wrong. And if they pass through all of these increases in
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.040]   inflation, and you know, their earnings expectations into Facebook, it's actually
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:25.840]   more like fair value at a lower price. That's why they sold it so much on a day where the market was
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.680]   up. Now, why is that important?
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:32.720]   Well, eventually, you're going to touch all these other stocks as well that are going to go
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:38.160]   through earnings revisions in this recession. This is where I think Wall Street has done a very poor
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:43.840]   job on behalf of retail. If you look at the average estimates of earnings, you will be shocked
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:50.160]   to hear that Wall Street actually has this year being record earnings next year earnings continuing
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:57.600]   to go up. How is that possible? Well, how is that? How is it if we're sitting here? How do you see
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:03.440]   how do you see earnings continuing to go up into these prints like this when you cannot pass through
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:09.520]   you know, 80 90% increases in energy and cogs and whatnot? How does it I think the
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.160]   what people would say is maybe they're going to lower their costs. And so with layoffs,
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:20.880]   and lowering salaries and lowering spend on advertising, you know, the earn it the E could go
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:26.080]   up if people because start belt tightening, and then we start having companies that are being run,
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.520]   you know, just
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.240]   more, you'll have to sell, you'll have to sell fewer things, because there'll be fewer people
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:37.040]   with jobs to buy things. But we have 10 million job openings. So this is the weird thing about
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.760]   this recession is because we haven't let a lot of people immigrate into the country. But we have so
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.480]   many jobs. Is that what you think the consensus view on Wall Street is that basically a bunch of
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.120]   people get fired. And so that's why earnings continue to go up? Well, they stop hiring for two
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.000]   years in advance, right? Facebook said they were hiring for like 2024. Their hiring plans were
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.440]   looking at two years. And so they're going to stop hiring for two years in advance. And so they're
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.440]   going to stop hiring for two years in advance. And so they're going to stop hiring for two years in
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.000]   advance. And so they're going to stop hiring for two years in advance. And so they're going to
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.320]   stop hiring for two years in advance. And so they're going to stop hiring for two years in advance.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.800]   You know, and that's their number one cost. I'm just putting out a theory.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.320]   I'll give you the counterfactual. I think Wall Street's wrong. Okay. And I think that
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:13.360]   earnings are going to go down this year, and will definitely go down in 23. And so I think what
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:19.920]   probably happens is the entire world of equities needs to get repriced at a lower price. And in
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.880]   that, it's going to put enormous pressure on these cash burning non profitable tech companies.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.360]   Well, that's for sure. But in the ones that are profitable, Chamath,
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.760]   they're aware of this Facebook just canceled like two of their prototypes they were working on to
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.720]   save money. So that whole $10 billion into, you know, VR, I think they're trying to make that
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:42.000]   number looks more smaller. Sacks, what do you think? Well, I think you're bringing up a really
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.440]   interesting point with this, the 10 million, you know, job openings. And now that that number is
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.800]   coming down really fast as companies close open racks, and they basically freeze hiring. So that
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.280]   number is going to come down very, very fast. But one of the major contributors to inflation
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:03.840]   is that the labor force participation has been very low, millions of people left the labor force
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:10.240]   during COVID as a result of the stimulus checks and the freezing of rent and evictions. I mean,
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.280]   look, rents the number of people's number one expense, if they don't have to pay rent for a
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.240]   couple of years, a lot of them may not work or may not work as much. So we've had this problem
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:24.240]   where we really need about 2 million people to re enter the labor force. And if you describe
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.200]   inflation as too much money, chasing too few people, it's going to be a lot of work. And if you
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.840]   look at the labor force, it's going to be a lot of work. And if you look at the labor force,
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.680]   it's going to be a lot of work. And if you look at the labor force, it's going to be a lot of work.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.600]   And when you have millions of people dropping out of the labor force, you've got less goods
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:41.760]   and services being produced that people want. So just reducing the money supply is not going to get
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.000]   us out of this mess. We also need to improve productive capacity.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.680]   Just to put a number on that we peaked in the 1999 era at 67% of
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.120]   participation in labor force. And then it's been down in this low 60 61 62.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.600]   And it continues to be low. But that is the solution here we get that 7% that gap.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.480]   You could change the demand side because if all you do is fix the demand side,
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.680]   what you're doing is you're killing the economy to reduce demand in order to bring it down prices.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.400]   That's very painful. It's all pain. But what you also have to do is fix the supply side,
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.600]   you have to increase the availability of all the critical inputs into the economy. So
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:27.040]   labor obviously is one of them, but also critical resources, like energy,
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.040]   you know, oil, natural gas, and so on. And that goes back to fixing the supply chain,
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:37.680]   hopefully getting a resolution of the situation in Ukraine, the war. So if we could fix those things,
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.320]   it's a way to improve the economy without creating more pain.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:46.160]   Freeberg, if the prices of just daily living of which transportation and housing and healthcare
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.280]   are now the top three, I believe, groceries and healthcare, I think have flip flopped a couple
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.640]   times in the last decade in terms of costs. If those things go up, would that make people want to
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.320]   go back to work to pay for those things? Or does it create capitulation where people say I'm moving
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.160]   in with my cousin, I'm going to lower my balance sheet? What is your prediction there? Are more
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.480]   people going to go to work? Or do we still have this, you know, call it 10 million people in the
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.200]   country who just don't want to go to work? I've mentioned this in the past,
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:16.400]   but I think there's more. There's another kind of interesting outcome of this,
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:21.120]   we've had several months in a row of pretty significant increase in consumer credit.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.520]   And I think the reason is, things are getting more expensive.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:33.520]   And I think that's because people generally do not like to reduce their spend on stuff or their
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.720]   living their lifestyle. Once you get used to a lifestyle, like going out to dinner once a week,
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.120]   or going to the movies every week, and you create a budget, you create a life experience around that
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.920]   a model around that, it's very hard to say, Okay, I got to cut budget now. And I got to reduce my
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.120]   life, I would rather say I'm going to keep doing that, or at least there's some inertia or some
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:56.480]   momentum to keep spending on the things that you've been spending on. And the way you do that in a model
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:01.360]   of a business is you take on more debt. And so there is a little bit of a nervousness that I have
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:10.080]   had, that people's response generally, the consumer response to inflation, and to a kind of
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:19.200]   a shifting income environment like this is not necessarily to cut as quickly but take on more
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:26.400]   debt and keep keep buying. And so I am a little nervous about that. But I think that's the way
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.280]   to do it. And I think that's the way that you can do it. I mean, I don't know if I'm going to be able to
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.520]   do that, but I do think obviously, at some point, everyone has to figure out ways to generate income,
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.160]   there have been a lot of these kind of ancillary markets that are typically the first to go these
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.440]   extra services markets where people, you know, have found other ways to make money side hustles and
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:50.080]   whatnot, that may or may not be as robust as they have been historically. And so people may need to
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:56.320]   go back for more secure, stable income. And and these jobs get filled. I like I mean, as we all
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:02.160]   know, this is the whole concept, I think behind build back better. It's not super thoughtful in
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.880]   terms of the approach, I think, based on my understanding of where that money is supposed
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:12.240]   to go, because it doesn't create long term jobs. But there is an opportunity to build new
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:17.440]   manufacturing and new infrastructure jobs in the US right now, that could enable a healthy transition
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.920]   here. But that legislation needs to be done smart. It can't be done with this, like, hey, let's build
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.240]   a bunch of bridges. And then a bunch of contractors make a bunch of money and no one has any long term jobs
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:31.760]   out of it. We've got to find ways to spend money on creating long term, sustainable, you know, new
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:39.040]   industry here. Yeah, job openings 11.4. It's come down about six or 7%. So you know, it's going to
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:44.240]   be trailing, but it's for sure we're seeing it in our industry with the hiring freezes that, you
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.760]   know, we're going to work through those open jobs, what are the chances that inflation gets under
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:56.160]   control in the next year? And should the Fed go for like the 1% slam on the brakes, there was some talk
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.240]   about that, obviously, they went from 50 to 75. Remember, a lot of the elements that we were
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:05.920]   kind of saying, Oh, my gosh, I can't believe the climate prices. So you know, wheat is down,
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:13.760]   I think 30%, lumber is down 50%. Gas prices are coming down. So you know, there are some of these,
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.920]   you know, commodity spikes that we've experienced over the past couple of quarters, particularly
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.320]   recently, that are really that have had a significant part of the fueling effect on the
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.080]   inflationary trickle down.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:33.520]   into ultimately end products and whatnot. And those are coming down. You know, there's a real
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.520]   question of how quickly that flows through the economy and flows through to the price of goods
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:44.320]   that consumers ultimately end up paying for. The gas prices right now are the biggest concern,
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:49.600]   right? Like unless you can get gas prices under control, that always always has a massive impact
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:56.000]   on spending on consumer spending, which drives a recessionary cycle. And so if I'm the Biden admin
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.600]   I'm first and foremost
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.480]   I don't care about the general
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:05.180]   Inflationary indicators as much as I care about getting the price of gas down. That is a super super critical number to face
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:12.240]   Is this are these gas prices gonna change how Americans look at what car they buy because they're gonna get worse time
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:17.840]   We had that they're gonna know people started looking at not buying SUVs. We could have $7 gas
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.040]   Oh, I said there was a picture actually I tweeted in California
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.160]   There was a $7.11 gas broadly broadly
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.320]   We could have $7 gas all throughout the country
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:33.020]   But Jake out the you know, remember the average automotive automobile in the US lasts for 12 years
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.700]   That's how often people change out their cars. So that's 8% of the fleet being changed per year
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:44.840]   yep, and the interest rates for auto loans have spiked like crazy now with this change in the Fed rates and as a result the
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:51.940]   Delinquency on auto loan portfolios has spiked like crazy. Yeah, and so, you know, yes sure theoretically
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.560]   People will think about buying an electric car
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.560]   But most people aren't thinking about that on average
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:59.860]   For five or six years from now because that's the average of a 12-year cycle right five five years from now
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.860]   Wait till all these peloton bikes need to get repossessed
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:08.080]   well all these actually the the the weight for cars and the overpricing of cars has ended in the last two months and
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.540]   There are multiple cars now in the market 25 30 K for a 50 plus mile per gallon car
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:16.660]   I think this actually one of the silver linings coming out of this is people might actually
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:21.840]   Stop buying as many SUVs or you know, I think our average is in the low 20s right now in
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.180]   Europe's is in the high 40s. The problem is like, you know every other four miles per gallon
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.760]   part of the government
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:35.620]   Acknowledges that you have to really ring fence and protect consumers, right? Like if you look at the securities laws
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.240]   They're meant to protect them at all costs
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:44.460]   And Jason you've you know, you've been frustrated by some of the rules that haven't changed and when they change they change so slowly
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:51.060]   but the reason is because sometimes that you want people to make good decisions and if you
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.840]   You know give them a bunch of firepower. They're just gonna spend it and you know
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.820]   what we really did was we gave folks just a ton of money and
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:05.880]   What did they do they acted rationally they spent it. Yeah now we have to take it all back
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:11.820]   And that's that's I don't think that's gonna be as easy or as simple as people think
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:16.680]   What what percentage of the money supply do you think is in excess right now in the United States?
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.820]   Well, look I told you this because I wrote this in my annual letter, but it's it's stunning that you know
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:26.520]   The reason the stock market went up dollar for dollar was actually tied to the growth in the m2 money supply
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:35.100]   The correlation was 0.9 - so for every dollar that the Fed printed the stock market went up by 92 cents
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:42.320]   So, you know it stands to reason that if the Fed is going to take three to five trillion dollars of value out
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.840]   Then we have to rewrite the equity markets by three to five trillion dollars at a minimum
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.340]   and then you have to rewrite and rebase line for earnings and
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:55.000]   So that's probably another twenty or thirty. Let's skin. Yeah, let's talk about the endgame here
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.360]   the rates go up people stop buying homes people go back to work and
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:05.620]   Energy prices come back down because people are not buying as much of it
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:11.600]   Spending goes down and people rebalance and that takes a year the job openings could also disappear by the way
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.940]   I mean like they're going down four hundred thousand a month is
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:20.620]   You're assuming that all of a sudden like demand is stable, but it's not necessarily stable in it and it demand and in a demand
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:25.660]   Contraction yes people get fired but then also new job openings change, right?
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:31.920]   Yeah, there's fewer of them there. They're more specific in the way that people salaries go down, right? That's the salaries go down
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:36.060]   That's the piece I'm waiting for that to me. That would be I don't know if you guys have early warning signs
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.980]   But the two early warning signs I have in my you know
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:42.680]   job of investing in early stage companies is when people
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:48.840]   Well, what's the average salary for an engineer if that hasn't gone down by now, then it's a lagging indicator, right?
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.520]   It would be to me capitulation
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:58.220]   Salaries go down or people instead of laying people off sacks. They do salary cuts at a company. That is really hard to do, right?
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:02.000]   That's yeah, I don't think they do some references in deals, right?
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.420]   I think the way the salaries come down is that
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:10.760]   Startups freeze their hiring plans where they lay people off and all of a sudden the war for talent subsides easier to hire people
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.580]   And so there's no need to keep raising up. Are you seeing that?
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:20.060]   Yeah, I think we're seeing the beginning of it, but I gotta tell you I mean I think that startups have not fully
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:26.560]   Embraced or realized what what's happening? I just got back from the KOTU summit over the past couple of days
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.280]   This was an event that was hosted by KOTU
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:34.680]   You know whose founders are Philippe and Thomas Lafont very smart guys
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:39.160]   Very smart investors who've been public market sort of hedge fund investors for a long time
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:44.500]   But also have a large venture fund to do growth stage investing some of the takeaways from that conference
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:49.980]   some of the more vivid lines that stuck with me is that one of the speakers said
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:56.760]   That he said that when it comes to runway for startups three to four years is the new two years
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:02.880]   Because if you just have two years of runway, you're gonna need to raise in a year and in a year from now
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.500]   We're gonna be in the middle of a recession
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:09.960]   They're predicting they're forecasting that capital availability is gonna decline about 75% the amount of money
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.800]   That's venture money that's available the ecosystem down by three quarters
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:20.180]   so if you try to raise in that environment either you're not gonna be able to or investors are gonna you know,
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:25.760]   Have all the leverage you're not gonna get terms that you like so they were recommending three to four years of runway
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:29.040]   So that is not what I think a lot of companies are
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:37.980]   Possible the other thing that the other really vivid takeaway is that they did some polling of the startup founders who are in attendance
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.980]   okay, and
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:46.320]   What the numbers basically showed is a is a contradiction on the one hand the founders sort of understood that
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.580]   Intellectually that we're headed into a downturn. We're headed to a recession
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:55.240]   And so the polling reflected that on the other hand if you ask the founders how they're gonna react to it
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.560]   What are you gonna do about it?
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:02.440]   You're gonna cut a headcount or you're gonna accelerate your business to beat competitors. Everybody said well, we're gonna out accelerate our competitors
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:08.320]   So everybody thought that they're the exception in other words, everyone understood we're headed for this massive recession
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.880]   It's gonna be really bad, but we're gonna be the one company that doesn't need to cut. We're actually gonna grow
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.460]   We're gonna accelerate during the downturn. So there was a real
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:19.940]   contradiction in how founders are interpreting this
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:24.040]   Advice and I have to tell you when I talk to founders in our own portfolio
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:29.900]   What I see is, you know, we've now done multiple meetings where we lay out what's happening in the economy and they get it
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:35.200]   They understand it and when we do a board meeting, they're like, okay, we're gonna go look at our plan and we're gonna reevaluate
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.660]   We're gonna make major cuts
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.400]   We're gonna bring our burn multiple down to you know
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:43.840]   The where it should be but then you know when you check in with them a couple of months later and you're like
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.580]   Where are you on the plane haven't taken the medicine?
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.920]   It's or the medicine is like a 10% cut and I'm like guys like 10%
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.500]   It's a performance review. Yeah, like 10% you're doing every year
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:58.600]   Anyway, yeah, you get rid of the the bottom like the C performers you promote the A's and B's and you get rid of the C
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.660]   so
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:02.200]   no one really wants to take the medicine yet and
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.160]   You know, it's a problem
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:10.640]   I mean Sequoia has this great chart called survival of the quickest that we should put up on the screen and it shows two lines
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:16.120]   One company is the one that takes the medicine right away brings their burn down to where it should be and then they're able
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.460]   To grow from there and they really will out accelerate the competitors
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:27.020]   But then there's the company that basically delays and waits and what happens is by the time they finally get religion to make the cuts
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:32.180]   It's too late because even after they make the cuts they don't have enough runway on the other side burn the capital
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.220]   Yeah, they burn the capital and then they're in a death spiral
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:38.600]   So I think you know what what companies need to think about is this is a 75% reduction
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.700]   Imagine if you did a hundred million dollar round last year, right?
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:49.220]   If you go try to raise next year in the most recession that a hundred million dollar round might look like a twenty five million dollar
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:49.720]   round
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:56.100]   So imagine if you're burning an extra twenty five to fifty million more than you should be according to your burn multiple
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:51:01.160]   You're basically burning the next round forget about the fact that the last round gave you all this cushion
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:08.160]   Think about how much of the next round you're burning and if you re-orient your thinking around that it could lead to a change in behavior
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.060]   anecdotally, I'm seeing
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.060]   people come back from
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:18.700]   Rounds where they were expecting forty or fifty million dollars in some cases like with
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:23.420]   150k in revenue five hundred K in revenue. They were living in a two hundred
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:28.000]   three hundred times revenue kind of world it was just insane and
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.920]   You know, they're now coming back with ten million dollar caps fifteen million dollar caps on their notes
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   I was offered a hundred million dollars
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:41.720]   At a fifty percent discount and I said call me when you get to 65 and that's the best company
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:48.200]   That's literally the best company. That's the best and the best founders to bet on right of probably most private companies is them
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.520]   You don't like that valuation?
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.020]   What is that valuation forty at fifty percent off?
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:59.180]   It's less of a judgment on but it's just more an observation that we're at the beginning of the beginning
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.120]   And again, we're at the beginning of the beginning
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:09.980]   Okay for all of us that lived through the 2000. This was four years of sheer hell and a grind
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:19.040]   now we have thirty trillion dollars that we have to work through the economy a recession we have to overcome a war we need to end and
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:25.680]   People all of a sudden assume that two or three rate hikes and five or six months of headlines are enough
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   And on the margin, maybe they're right, but from my perspective, you know, it's less a judgment on but it's just an observation that we're at
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:41.100]   the beginning of something that just fundamentally has to take some amount of time to work its way through the system and so I don't understand why
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.240]   anybody
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:47.880]   Would give up their liquidity in this moment right now. Why would you why would I why would I give up a hundred million dollars?
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.880]   I would not do that right now
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:55.240]   Because the cash the caps the cash gives you so much optionality. It's based so much optionality
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.500]   So you're gonna be looking for distress and this is the thing
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:03.060]   So you have a huge amount of capital leaving the ecosystem like we know tiger is basically out
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:07.880]   I mean they were the basically the default provider of growth stage capital over the last couple of years
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:13.480]   So you have a lot of liquidity leaving the system and then the liquidity that's in the system is waiting for distress
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.780]   So you're right in it. There's a quarter. I mean like we talked about there's a quarter
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.300]   A quarter trillion dollars of quote-unquote dry powder
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.540]   I mean, I know Chamath thinks that people are gonna give that money back, but there's never
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:28.900]   They're not gonna give it back
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:35.800]   Yeah, look at that that tiger fund tiger raised a new twelve billion dollar fund that was announced in March and tech crunch
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:40.600]   We covered it on the show a month ago. Yeah, the tech crunch on article saying was already deployed in six months
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:45.780]   So I wasn't on that show. Oh, that was the one where Jake I'll try to replace you with Brad Gerstner
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.680]   We should show weekly going forward
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.320]   It's not a monthly might be better to keep up with these trends
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:50.800]   Okay
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.820]   Jake how you make a good point there creates go back this for a second
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:59.160]   You said the founders were they're still anchored on this world of two to three hundred times ARR evaluations
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.200]   Let me just tell you where the new valuation levels are and this is obviously in flux
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:08.160]   But I'm pretty sure the valuation levels are at twenty to thirty times ARR. That's for a company
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.620]   That's growing 3x year-over-year. Yeah 3x year-over-year. That's the best of the best the reason
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:14.620]   How do you get there next year's?
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.580]   Yes, exactly and the way that you get there
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:24.760]   Is that if you look at like the the multiples for like the best public SAS companies that are like say a forty percent grower?
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:30.440]   Like a snowflake there at 8x. Yeah, so, you know, so basically giving more credit for
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:35.140]   The higher growth rate. Yeah, right, but they really have to have that 3x growth
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:41.000]   So, you know if you're a founder think about the fact that when you try to go raise next year
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.140]   Assuming you're the best of the best you'll get twenty to thirty times ARR now think about your spending not
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:53.680]   Last round's money you're spending the next round's money. If you could just reorient your thinking that way you'd burn a lot less money
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.400]   Yeah, the the I literally had a deal
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:05.380]   You know in the 30 and 40 range and angel investors who never early stage angel investors seed funds that did not look at
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:08.160]   multiples are now
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:13.180]   Asking me because when I send a deal memo to 10,000 people for my syndicate people hit reply
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:17.380]   People are hitting reply now and saying I did the math on this. This is the multiple
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:20.280]   This is this this is the burn multiple. They're actually doing the math
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:26.680]   So we all of a sudden have discipline that I have not seen in this investor class in the ten years
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:31.420]   I've been doing it. So that is to me one of the great silver linings here
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:34.600]   I think people are gonna do a better job with their personal balance sheets
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:41.180]   They're gonna invest less in speculative stuff and they're going to invest more in the actual builders who have discipline
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:47.040]   So we're gonna see this massive swing to discipline and we're gonna flush out all the people who don't have
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:53.260]   Market think about all those folks like what's happened in the last six months. It's like they've been long unprofitable tech
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:56:00.840]   It's got smoked by 75 to 85 percent. They've been long crypto that's gotten spoked by 65 percent more
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:06.800]   Yeah, I mean if they weren't using a calculator then they sure as hell should be using a calculator now to figure it out
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:12.120]   I mean people well you think about it. There's a whole group of investors who have only known the up market
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:17.160]   There's a whole group of founders who only know the growth market if you're under 40 years old, you don't understand what?
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:23.780]   You're about to experience and here we are. Let's that's a perfect time to segue into crypto bitcoins price is down
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.400]   71 percent
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.400]   from the all-time high
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.340]   69k in November of 2021 bottomed out at
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:36.280]   17,000 or so on June 18th the theorems price down 78 percent
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:42.980]   And if you look at the craziness since the last all-in episode, you know this three AC three arrow capital
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:44.980]   They're a crypto hedge fund that was letting people
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:47.080]   Basically loan out
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.440]   They're crypto
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.600]   They are basically closing a 10 billion dollar
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.520]   crypto
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:59.200]   Hedge fund at its peak they're insolvent according to the reports Terra Luna collapsed the
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:06.600]   Founders and employees at that company are not being allowed to leave South Korea doesn't mean they're guilty, but it's certainly not looking good
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   and
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:14.800]   There is a whole situation with Solana and a company built on top of it. So lend which is not Solana
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.980]   It's an application built on top of it. I talked to Vinnie Lingard
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:20.400]   My friend earlier this week about it. They had a whale who had
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:26.840]   Tried to loan out a hundred million and they had to freeze their account because they thought the downward pressure
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:34.540]   Since there's not many buyers in crypto right now could collapse Solana. So thoughts on crypto writ large. What is this gonna look like sacks?
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:38.240]   Over the means like a crash all over again
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:44.180]   I mean basically you had an extremely promising technology. I mean it is a promising technology, of course
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:46.780]   It is a future, you know technology platform
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:48.220]   but the
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:55.440]   price action got totally decoupled from the level of progress in the space and people were not valuing these things based on
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:58:00.720]   Real customers real usage and real use cases, but it was became, you know, very speculative
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.940]   And again, all this was fueled by the excess liquidity that was pumped into the system
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:08.820]   So, you know, we've said it before that crypto is like a liquidity sponge
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:15.060]   It sucks up when there's a lot of excess liquidity. It sucks up that liquidity, but now that sponge is getting wrung out and
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:18.720]   You know part of the problem is with interest rates going up
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.600]   you know, it's one thing when you have negative real interest rates and
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.840]   And and and you can't earn a return on your money
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:28.380]   then you start to get you basic people start to push the envelope and
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:32.880]   Invest in more more speculative things but as you can get a real return in
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.000]   Like they'll say there's like a real risk-free rate
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.560]   Now there's alternatives for all that cash and then you got the problem of leverage as well
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:46.080]   Which I think over the last few weeks the crypto space was heavily over levered and a lot of people got margin calls
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:50.760]   And wiped out that's the contagion that's occurred and people were levered up five ten times
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:55.340]   They're Bitcoin on these roads until these token sale things get litigated
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:59:02.200]   I mean the amount God the amount of grift by so many of these venture firms in running these
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:06.120]   Sketchy deals where they would put in some amount of money
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:11.320]   This is my understanding of the scam because it was explained to me you put in a little bit of equity at some crazy price
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:15.960]   And then you get these tokens and apparently there's no like you can just sell these tokens
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:20.100]   Day one and so what happens is like you you price the equity
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:24.300]   But it's meaningless because really what you're getting is the right to get some amount of these tokens
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:29.400]   The price is crazy you sell it and then you just kind of walk away and apparently, you know
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.060]   You do these deals where you just rinse and repeat this thing
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:39.400]   Well, wait, wait till that gets exposed. I mean, it seems like a turn the firm that did this the most is Andreessen Horowitz
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:44.760]   Chris Dixon, I think was considered like the best investor last year or the year before
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.840]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.840]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.840]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.840]   I mean, I think he's a great investor

[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.840]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.840]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.720]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.720]   I mean, I think he's a great investor

[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.720]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.720]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.720]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.720]   I mean, I think he's a great investor
