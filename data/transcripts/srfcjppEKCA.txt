[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   There's not that many ways you can hack your trip to Iceland.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.520]   One of the challenges is that almost every flight
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.180]   is on Icelandair, which has its own rewards program
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.040]   that I'm guessing almost no one listening to
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.040]   has points and miles that will get them in.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.000]   The only exception to that is that they are a partner
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.960]   of Alaska Airlines.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.920]   And so you can book Icelandair flights with Alaska miles.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.220]   Availability depends, but I couldn't find a single date
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.700]   that was available anywhere near when we wanted to go,
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.480]   even up till the day or two before in business class.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.400]   Only economy.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.040]   The planes themselves on Icelandair, I thought were fine.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.240]   They were new, they're modern.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.040]   Business class was the same as you'd seen
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.320]   in a domestic business class.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.960]   So you might think, do I really wanna splurge for this?
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.120]   And yes, you will get a bigger seat and more room,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.480]   but you will absolutely not get a lie-flat bed
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.360]   like you would splurging for business class
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.600]   on almost every other overseas flight.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.560]   With the exception of United Airlines does have,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.400]   and I think it might be the only,
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.920]   but things change all the time.
