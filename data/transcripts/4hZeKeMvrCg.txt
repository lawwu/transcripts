[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   I so love this question today, Pastor John.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.440]   It comes from a French dad and a pastor named Raphael.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.640]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.040]   Thank you for this invaluable podcast.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.000]   My question for you is how I can best communicate Christian hedonism to my
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.560]   children during our family worship.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.680]   They're ages five to 12.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.440]   What should be my aims and goals?
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.920]   Do you have any tips for a dad like me?
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.480]   Okay.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.520]   I love this question.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.240]   Let's see if we can do it.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.480]   It's been a long time since I was a dad of little kids.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.880]   I had five of them, but that's a long time ago.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.000]   Two things to make clear up front.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.280]   Parents must clarify clear Christian hedonism.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.720]   And I wouldn't recommend using the term with kids.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.440]   Forget that.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.920]   I don't think you mean that.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.360]   So they don't know.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.640]   They don't need to know the word hedonism at age four or five or six or whatever.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.880]   I'm not asking you to clarify the term.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.080]   I'm asking you to clarify the reality.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.680]   And the other thing you need to do is exemplify.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.120]   So hold those two phrases, clarify and exemplify, because that's what I'm going
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.640]   to talk about.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.680]   So clarify.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.800]   Three suggestions.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.920]   Show that the Bible commands rejoicing.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.640]   Philippians 4, 4, "Rejoice in the Lord always."
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.040]   And again, I will say, "Rejoice."
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.680]   So now the children know that it is not only permitted to be happy, it is
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.600]   required that they be happy in the Lord.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.920]   And of course, that will involve a lot of conversation with the children about how
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.240]   to pursue this joy or this happiness if they don't feel it.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.120]   That's a huge question.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.440]   And you help them with that.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.440]   And it will involve a lot of conversation about what "in the Lord" means, as
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.560]   opposed to just being happy with these gifts.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.800]   And you can help little children understand the difference between being happy that
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.160]   they have a mommy and being happy that mommy gives them breakfast.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.960]   Would you rather have mommy or breakfast?
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.880]   They get this.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.640]   Okay, number two, show the kids what it means to become a real Christian by going
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.200]   to Matthew 13, 44.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.320]   The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.880]   covered up.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.520]   And then in his joy, he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.760]   Now, children can grasp why this man was really, really, really, really happy to
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.600]   sell everything.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.520]   They get this.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.960]   If you ask him, "Why?
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.400]   Why was he happy to sell his toys, all his toys?"
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.560]   And they're going to say, "Well, because the treasure was worth more than the
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.040]   toys."
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.240]   That's what they're going to say, which is right.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.200]   This is not a hard thing to understand.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.440]   You could even act this out in a little drama.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.720]   I tried to imagine this, like hide mama behind the couch.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.920]   "Okay, let's go find mama.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.840]   I think we can find mama.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.600]   Whoa, there she is."
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.240]   Then she comes out and now you have to ask, "Okay, what would you be willing to
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.720]   sell to have your mama stay in this house while you're growing up?"
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.640]   They get that.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:34.080]   Number three, tell them my rose story, but rewrite it for kids, which I've done to
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.800]   read to you now.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.320]   Okay?
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.640]   You may not even know what my rose story is and I won't tell the rose story.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.880]   That'll take too much time.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.800]   So I'm going to make up a situation and give you my version for kids.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:52.040]   So this story you can tell to your children to clarify the very essence of
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.440]   Christian hedonism, which is that God is most glorified in you when you're most
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.240]   satisfied in him.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.440]   So pretend that there's a family that has a 12-year-old boy named Tim and an
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.920]   eight-year-old little brother named Eric.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.280]   Okay?
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.160]   Eric thinks Tim is the greatest thing in the world.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.240]   He admires his big brother.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.720]   He thinks he's really cool.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.880]   He loves spending time with Tim and he loves to go fishing.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.560]   His birthday is coming and Tim, the older brother, really wants to make Eric happy
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.480]   with a special birthday gift.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.200]   So Tim takes a few odd jobs around the neighborhood, helping people with their
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.760]   yard work to earn some extra money so he can buy Eric a really nice fishing rod
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.560]   with his own tackle box that he's never had before.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.440]   But to make it really special, Tim puts a note in the tackle box that says, "This is
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   a certificate of promise to take you fishing all day, the Saturday after your
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.560]   birthday, just you and me."
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.840]   So Tim earns the money, buys the gifts, wraps them up, puts them inside the box,
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.080]   and on Eric's birthday, Eric opens the packages, loves the rod, loves the tackle
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.440]   box.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.960]   Then he opens the box and finds Tim's note.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.720]   He unfolds it and reads it.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.960]   "Wow," he says, "this is the greatest.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.680]   I love the rod, Tim, and I love the tackle box, but all day, just you and me fishing.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.680]   Wow."
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.480]   And suppose Tim, the older brother, smiles and says, "My pleasure, Eric.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.880]   In fact, I can't think of anything I'd rather do or that would make me happier
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.600]   this Saturday than to spend the day with you."
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.680]   And suppose Eric's face, little brother, Eric's face darkens.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.840]   The joy goes out of his eight-year-old heart and he snorts.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.920]   "It's your pleasure.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.760]   Nothing would make you happier."
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.040]   So it's all about you, Tim.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.240]   It's all about what makes you happy.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.160]   You're so selfish.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.880]   Now, Tim would be absolutely stunned at this reaction.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.120]   Speechless.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.680]   Okay, story's over.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.480]   End of story.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:23.280]   And you ask your children, "Why would Tim be surprised, even hurt, by Eric's
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.840]   response like that?"
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.920]   And the reason Tim is stunned and speechless is because that would never
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.640]   happen.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.400]   And then your kids would say, "Eric's not going to say that.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.960]   Eric would never respond this way.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.800]   Why not?"
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.960]   Tim did say, in fact, "It's my pleasure."
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.800]   He did say, "I can't think of anything that would make me happier than to spend
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.600]   the day with you."
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:54.360]   But you know, and your children know intuitively, Eric would never be upset
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.120]   about this.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.440]   He would never treat Tim as if he were being selfish.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.400]   Why not?
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:08.880]   Because when Tim finds his happiness in spending time with Eric, Tim honors Eric.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.640]   He treats Eric like he's really something.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.960]   And Eric intuitively feels this.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.000]   He feels honored.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.960]   He feels loved.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.920]   He feels cared for.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   He feels enjoyed.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.720]   Tim is treating Eric as special.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.440]   Tim is saying, "There's something about you, Eric, that makes me happy."
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.840]   "There's something about you, Eric, that makes me want to spend the day with you
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.760]   on Saturday."
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.360]   And then you tell your children that this is a parable.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.400]   It's a story about how we should relate to God.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.920]   When we enjoy, when we want to spend time with God, God is honored.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.040]   So our being happy in God is what makes God look great.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.360]   And making God look great is what the Bible says we're supposed to do.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.960]   Glorify God in everything.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.360]   So we have to pursue happiness in God if we're going to make God look amazing.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.680]   That's the way I would try to clarify Christian hedonism for the children.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.000]   And more briefly, just a word or two about exemplify.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.680]   I'm not sure how you do this, but I would suggest that you do two things to exemplify
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.640]   Christian hedonism.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.800]   The first is that our children need to see us enjoying God, enjoying Him in worship,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.720]   enjoying Him in devotions, enjoying Him in ordinary tasks of life.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:41.320]   God should feel to these children because it feels to us because He feels to us like
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.720]   a burden lifter, not a burden giver.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.920]   A lifter of our sins through forgiveness because of Jesus.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:57.720]   And a lifter of burdens, the burdens of life as we trust Him to work everything together
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.120]   for good.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:06.240]   Oh, how we communicate to our kids whether God is able to carry the burdens of life by
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:12.560]   whether we enjoy God in the midst of the stresses of life or not.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:18.280]   And the second thing I would say that might not be as obvious is we should enjoy our
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.360]   children, not just enjoy God, but enjoy our children.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.080]   We have made the case with our little story.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.800]   We've made the case that a person is honored when they are enjoyed.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.960]   We want to honor our children.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.520]   The Bible says, "outdo one another in showing honor."
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.440]   It says to count others more significant, more honorable than ourselves.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.920]   And one of the ways we count others as significant and one of the ways we honor
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.760]   others is by manifestly enjoying their presence.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:10:00.680]   Many children feel like a burden to their parents, like they are in the way.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:09.320]   If we enjoy our children, we will communicate to them that the most natural thing is to
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.520]   enjoy what we value.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:20.320]   This will translate much more easily into the worship of God than if the children only
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.560]   feel like burdens.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:30.840]   So the pathway to breathing mature Christian hedonists is to manifestly enjoy God,
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:38.280]   manifestly enjoy the children and take them deeper and deeper into the scriptures.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.240]   I love this episode.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.160]   Fantastic counsel, Pastor John.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.760]   Thank you.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.400]   May it influence and change my own parenting.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:45.880]   Thank you.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.000]   And a great parenting question too.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.440]   Keep those coming in to us.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.480]   And if you have a question, you can do that through our online home and over at our
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.080]   online home.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:59.040]   You can explore all 1,250 of our episodes, scan a list of our most popular ones, read
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.640]   full transcripts and get those questions emailed to us.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.200]   You can do all that through DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.160]   Well, we have addressed whether or not a Christian can attend a so-called gay wedding.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.960]   But what about the wedding of two fornicating heterosexuals who lived together before the
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.360]   wedding?
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.160]   Isn't that sort of the same predicament or is it?
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.200]   It's a really great question, an important question.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.640]   And it's next on Friday when we return.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.840]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and we'll see you then.
