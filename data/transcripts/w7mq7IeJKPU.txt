[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   There's just like so much pressure to try to raise the perfect child,
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.960]   be the perfect parent.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.320]   What can people do?
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.960]   Because it seems like a lot of parents carry a tremendous amount of burden
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.080]   and stress about trying to make sure their kid has every opportunity,
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.400]   gets the perfect school, gets the perfect this.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   The amount of control you have over your kid's success
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.280]   and outcomes is quite a bit less than many of us think.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.280]   So the corollary of a lot of the choices we make probably don't matter
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.120]   as much as we think is that, you know, you could do everything right,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.440]   even if that were a thing.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.800]   And then your kid might not turn out to be an Olympic athlete
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.880]   like you had hoped or whatever was your was your dream.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   And that loss of control, that's I think really that's really hard
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.400]   for a lot of people.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.800]   And I think sometimes people would benefit by asking a little bit more.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.400]   What do I want my life to look like with my kid right now
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.520]   rather than what am I trying to build?
