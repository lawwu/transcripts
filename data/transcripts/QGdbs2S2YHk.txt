[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.660]   - Today, we're gonna talk about learning
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.000]   and how to learn more efficiently
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.840]   and essentially how to just learn a lot.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   Right now, the world is very big on change.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.680]   Most of the work that I do didn't exist
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.600]   even a few years ago.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.600]   And being able to learn and adapt is super essential,
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.680]   both in terms of just financial security
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.720]   in the modern world.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.740]   And I also think in terms of your own personal fulfillment,
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.900]   if you are learning, you're usually happier,
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.320]   at least that's what I find.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.320]   However, continuously learning new things all the time,
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.280]   if you don't do it properly,
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.040]   it can fry your brain very quickly.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.160]   So what I want to talk about is how I approach learning
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.240]   because every single day I'm learning a ton of new things
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.600]   and how I do that without hitting burnout
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   or at least trying to limit it as much as possible.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.720]   So we'll cover, I think, five main things.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.320]   We're gonna talk about change,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.140]   what I like to call the learning energy bar,
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.240]   sleep, task switching,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.320]   and also general motivation and discipline
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.000]   and how they kind of interact.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.120]   So first I want to talk about change.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.840]   Now, my experience with burnout
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   is kind of different to what I see
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.200]   most people talking about.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.320]   Most of these people are like,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.580]   "Okay, burnout is when you're working too much
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.000]   "and don't have any breaks,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   "like the volume of work triggers the burnout."
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.760]   I think it's more like the continuous chipping away
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   at a task without seeing much progress
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.280]   and without changing the task.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.080]   I think that's what seems to trigger burnout,
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.040]   at least for me.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.040]   So for me to avoid burnout, change is really important.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.200]   So the ideal scenario here would be
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.440]   to find work that is incredibly varied
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.260]   so that every single day is like a new novel experience.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.640]   However, I think that's unrealistic for a few reasons.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.720]   First, I think if you need to,
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.000]   you want to master something, okay?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.120]   In your professional life,
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.320]   you need to master some sort of craft,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.280]   and you can't do that if you're not repeating
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.920]   some things over and over.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.800]   And second, my work is pretty varied.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.040]   I think more so now than it ever has been in the past.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.040]   But I feel like if I relied purely on my job
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.360]   to provide variation and change in my life,
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.280]   then I would end up probably burning out.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.760]   So it's bad advice if I'm like,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.560]   "Oh, you need to change your job
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.440]   to have a more varied working day or working week."
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.920]   It's just not realistic in a lot of cases.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.720]   Okay, I'm not saying it's not possible,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.280]   but there are other things
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.320]   that we can change much more easier
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.840]   and get as good as or even better results.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.040]   So the two options that work for me
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.400]   are changing my work environment
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.480]   and changing my focus.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.400]   So trying my sports or doing some sort of hobby.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.080]   So what do I do?
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.560]   One, I travel.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.120]   So if you can travel with work, 100% try that.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.520]   I know not everyone can,
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.280]   but I think a lot of us can at least work from home
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.400]   a few days a week.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.360]   So even if you can do that, that's still good, right?
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.600]   Okay, you can't maybe not travel abroad,
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.920]   but you can travel within your own country,
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.240]   or you can even go to a local cafe
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.200]   and just work from there,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.680]   or go to a local library and work from there,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.080]   just for a change of scenery.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.240]   It helps a lot.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.120]   And the other, so changing our focus,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.360]   this is something that I stumbled upon
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.800]   quite early in my life
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.480]   without even realizing until much later,
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.280]   which was going to the gym.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.840]   And that gave me almost like a change in focus.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.960]   Now, that's good for a few reasons.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.200]   Okay, so sports in general are good for a few reasons.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.960]   First, if you're more active, your body is healthier,
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.680]   and you have more energy,
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.760]   so you can do more essentially with each day
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.400]   without getting tired.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.280]   Okay, so you increase your energy bar.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.440]   And second, it gives you something else to focus on,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.000]   something else to stop with,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.400]   drilling away at the same task over and over again
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.560]   without any breaks.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.600]   So there's two levels and maybe more
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.720]   to having some sort of sport to switch up your focus.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.600]   And as I mentioned, those two points are completely valid,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.440]   whether you're lifting heavy weights at the gym,
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.520]   practicing yoga, or like catching waves at the beach.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.240]   All of those things and much more
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.520]   are all useful for this sort of thing.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.840]   Okay, point number two is that we seem to have
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   like a learning energy bar.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.920]   So what I mean by that is with each day,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.400]   you can view your learning energy bar
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.120]   as kind of like a health bar or stamina bar
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.880]   from a video game.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.280]   And the more things you learn
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.000]   or the more things that you pay attention to,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.920]   the more that's gonna decrease throughout the day, okay?
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.360]   And you only have a set amount of energy
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.880]   for learning every day.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.240]   And the importance of this is if you use that energy
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.080]   on things that are less important.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.240]   So learning something that maybe is less important
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.400]   as something else, or maybe you use it on not even learning,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.680]   but just looking at social media or watching TV,
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.440]   something along those lines.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.680]   Whenever you're doing these non-productive things,
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.880]   you're still kind of learning, your brain is being simulated
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.000]   and that decreases your learning energy bar.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   So what you need to do is prioritize what you need to learn
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.920]   and deprioritize things
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.800]   where you're not actually learning anything.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.520]   So you start first thing in the morning
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.440]   and just try and start learning straight away
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.120]   or doing the important work first
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.440]   before you do anything else.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.760]   Don't pick up your phone and look on social media
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.200]   because straight away, you wake up,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.400]   you're depleting your energy bar
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.720]   and you're also setting the tone for the rest of the day.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.680]   So I always try to be productive first thing
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.440]   and be very mindful of that energy bar.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.120]   Now, the third very important thing is sleep.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.440]   Now, this is very cliche advice,
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.560]   but I feel that not many people,
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.600]   including myself in the past, listen to this.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.520]   You need plenty of sleep to function optimally.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.840]   In the West, and actually, I think a lot of the world,
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.640]   there's this idea that successful people work hard
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.480]   and because they're working so hard, working so many hours,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.400]   they don't have much time for sleep,
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.720]   but they're just so driven
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.320]   that they just push through it, it's fine.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   And I can't think of a scenario where this is a good thing.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.280]   At least if you need to use your brain,
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.200]   your brain needs to have sleep.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.040]   Sleep is like the oil that powers your brain.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.200]   Every time you sleep, it kind of flushes out
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.600]   all of the rubbish and when you wake up in the morning,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.320]   hopefully, your brain should be fresh, okay?
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.160]   But it's only gonna be like that if you get enough sleep.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.140]   And how much is enough sleep?
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.260]   That's gonna vary for each person,
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.240]   but I would recommend you start with about eight hours.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.160]   Okay, and then you can move up or down
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.680]   depending on how you feel based on that.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.880]   Another thing that's super important
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.000]   is that you should try and wake up without an alarm, okay?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.560]   So if you have to rely on waking up
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.160]   with an alarm every morning,
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.660]   that means you're probably sleeping too late.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.220]   So you need to bring your sleeping time earlier
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.720]   in the day before and with that,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.520]   you should over time begin waking up earlier as well.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.480]   Like initially, sure, maybe you will need
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.080]   to keep that alarm clock,
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.280]   but just bring your bedtime earlier, sleep earlier,
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.160]   and another very important thing
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.640]   that is very understated when it comes to good sleep
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.600]   is having a routine with your sleep.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.640]   Have a set time every single day,
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.560]   not just the weekdays, but also the weekend.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.320]   A lot of people wake up really early on their weekdays
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.800]   and then on the weekend, they have a lie in
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.680]   and that's just not good.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.520]   You need to have a routine.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.700]   Try and like the same time every day if possible.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.040]   Sleep is really important.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.120]   It's definitely worth the time getting it right.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.900]   The next thing is task switching.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.640]   So what I mean by task switching is when we switch
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.400]   from doing one thing to another thing,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.960]   which we do all the time, okay?
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.320]   But when it comes to your work and learning new things,
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.880]   I'll use examples for myself right now, okay?
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.080]   So let's say I need to edit a video, okay?
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.260]   Or I need to record and edit a video.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.760]   And I also need to write an article
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.920]   on something unrelated, okay?
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   And then I also need to do some freelance developer work.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.960]   Okay, I need to do these three things throughout my week.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.040]   What would be a really bad idea
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.680]   is if I do those three things
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.320]   or two of those three things every single day.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.200]   That's really bad.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.040]   What you need to do is cluster the tasks
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.680]   into bigger time buckets, okay?
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.840]   So the first two days what I should do
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.760]   is focus on the freelance developer work.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.520]   The next two days I focus on recording and editing a video.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   And the final day maybe I focus on the writing the article.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.160]   That is how you should break things up.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:48.160]   Just try and cluster each task into the same time bracket
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.720]   and minimize that task switching
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.120]   where you're going from one task to another
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.600]   because every time you do that,
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.920]   your brain needs to kind of change what it's focusing on.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.240]   And you will notice that when you're switching
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.160]   from one task to another,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.640]   your brain kind of needs time
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.740]   to kind of easing into that other task, okay?
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.760]   So every time you switch to another task,
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.640]   you're wasting time.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.680]   So minimize those switches as much as you can.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.100]   It's not always possible.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.720]   And let's say with your work,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.840]   you do need to do one particular task every day,
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.320]   just try and do that at set time every day.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.720]   I think that's probably the best approach
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.640]   if you are forced to switch tasks.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.480]   The final point is motivation and discipline.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   Now, learning is a lot harder without real motivation.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:45.440]   Now, motivation in itself is a very hard thing to achieve.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.420]   And even if we do achieve motivation
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:54.420]   on a particular thing, it's a very fragile state of mind.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.700]   And you're probably gonna lose it at some point, okay?
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.900]   It would be very impressive
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.740]   if you managed to stay motivated forever
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.780]   on a particular thing.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.860]   It's probably not gonna happen.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.880]   Motivation will come and go.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.500]   And when it does go,
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.140]   there will be that inevitable moment
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.380]   when we are not motivated anymore.
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.700]   We have to then rely on discipline.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.460]   And the best way to be disciplined is to have a schedule.
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.500]   Now, there's a quote I really like
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.500]   that I read in a book called "The War of Art."
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.780]   Not the art of war, the war of art.
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.780]   And it's a quote attributed to a Nobel Prize laureate
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.400]   and prolific writer, William Faulkner.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.780]   William Faulkner describes this concept pretty well.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.760]   When asked where he gets his inspiration to write from,
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.100]   he responded, "I only write when inspiration strikes.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.940]   "Fortunately, it strikes at nine every morning."
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.060]   Now, the sort of joke or point
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.540]   that Faulkner is trying to make here is,
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.260]   okay, a writer is a creative discipline.
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.140]   You need to be somewhat inspired in order to do your work.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.340]   But you can't just rely on that inspiration
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.580]   'cause it's very much, it's the same as motivation.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.320]   It can come and go.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.380]   Instead, he relies on a disciplined approach
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.260]   to that inspiration or that motivation.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.260]   So by almost scheduling that inspiration every day,
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.860]   his mind gets into that sort of mindset of,
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.100]   okay, it's nine a.m., I'm sat at my desk.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.300]   Now is the time to work.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.980]   Now is the time to be inspired.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.740]   And even when he is not inspired,
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.140]   at least he sits there and he tries.
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.960]   You'd be surprised.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.820]   It can actually trigger that motivation.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.560]   It can trigger that inspiration.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.380]   And even if you cannot trigger it,
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.780]   you at least try your best, okay?
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.420]   Maybe it will not be the best quality of work
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.340]   when you're not as motivated or inspired,
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.740]   but you will at least get something out.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.940]   Now, both discipline and motivation together
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.020]   are both incredibly important for both learning
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.820]   and producing high-quality work.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.540]   Now, there are the five points.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.680]   And just to summarize,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.060]   I think the active application of the brain,
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.180]   the brain is the biggest consumer of energy
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.460]   in the human body.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.980]   So the active application of this massive sink of energy
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.140]   is hard, and you will use a lot of energy.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.220]   But this ability to learn and adapt,
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.280]   it is our unique selling point in nature.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:36.040]   And in industry, in tech, and in any other place,
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.640]   it is also your unique selling point, okay?
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.320]   If you can learn and adapt faster than others,
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.480]   you have a advantage to other people.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.600]   And at the same time,
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.320]   if you're able to learn and adapt quicker,
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.640]   you can kind of scramble your way into doing something
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.520]   that you actually enjoy and something that fulfills you.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.540]   And that's probably, I would say,
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.320]   the more important side of things,
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.000]   like trying to find something that you enjoy doing
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.920]   and being able to learn quick is,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.700]   at least from my point of view, the way to do that.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.440]   Now, learning to learn optimally,
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.120]   as far as I'm aware, never gets easy.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.920]   It's always, like every day,
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.640]   it's almost like an upward, uphill struggle.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.880]   You're always gonna be pushing the boulder up the hill.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.360]   And I don't think that will ever end.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.920]   But applying yourself in this way is incredibly fulfilling.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.480]   And it's the way to achieve what I think
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.640]   most of us want to achieve in our lives.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.080]   So even if it's just a little bit every day,
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.480]   just try and focus on learning.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.760]   It pushes you up that hill.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.200]   It gets you further along and makes your life progress.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.760]   So that's it for this video.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.800]   If you're interested in more videos like this,
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.840]   I feel like I have a lot to say on these sort of things,
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.680]   either on travel, learning, tech,
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.240]   you know, a huge number of things.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.460]   So let me know if you're interested
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.680]   in hearing something else in that area.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.960]   But for now, that's everything for this video.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.200]   So I hope it has been useful.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.360]   Thank you very much for watching,
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.960]   and I'll see you in the next one.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.800]   Bye.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.380]   (gentle music)
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.960]   (gentle music)
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
