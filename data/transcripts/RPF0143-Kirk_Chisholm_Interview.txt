[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   The holidays start here at Ralph's with a variety of options to celebrate traditions old and new.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.200]   Whether you're making a traditional roasted turkey or spicy turkey tacos,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.800]   your go-to shrimp cocktail, or your first Cajun risotto,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.800]   Ralph's has all the freshest ingredients to embrace your traditions.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.000]   Ralph's. Fresh for Everyone.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.400]   We've locked in low prices to help you save big storewide.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.400]   Look for the locked in low prices tags and enjoy extra savings throughout the store.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.000]   Ralph's. Fresh for Everyone.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.800]   So you have a bunch of money in your IRA,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.600]   and you might have some stocks or bonds or mutual funds,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800]   but you feel like you might like to invest in something else.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   Did you know that you can invest in real estate,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.400]   tax liens, private mortgages, gold and silver,
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.800]   horses, livestock, farmland, medical equipment,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   just about anything? A couple of small exceptions, but just about anything in your IRA?
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.400]   Today, we'll tell you how.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:22.800]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.800]   My name is Joshua Sheets and today is Thursday, January 29, 2015.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.400]   We're going to have fun today talking about one of my favorite areas,
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.800]   which is how we can use a tax advantaged account
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   in a possibly slightly more intelligent or at the very least more radical way.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   I bring to you today an interview with a guest named Kirk Chisholm,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.400]   and I met Kirk at FinCon when I went out there last year.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400]   I had been looking for an expert in this area to bring on the show,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.600]   and we struck up a conversation in the hallway,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.400]   and he said that he does, and I says,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   "I've been looking for someone like you to bring on the show."
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   Because as you'll hear in the interview, even though I'm aware of some of the laws,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   this is a very specialized area of planning,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   and it's something that most of us who've been mainstream advisors don't have much experience with.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   But Kirk has set up a firm.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   Going to share with you all about some ideas and some tips and some tactics.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   We're going to mention Mitt Romney's $100 million trust,
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   talk about how to make that happen,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   and hopefully give you some ideas for how you can invest in some more interesting things in your IRA.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   Enjoy.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   Kirk, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   I appreciate you making time for me today.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   Great. Thanks a lot, Joshua. I appreciate you having me on.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   I've been looking forward to this conversation since we met at FinCon,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   and it's going to be a fun one,
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   because we're going to talk about self-directed accounts, which is a big interest of mine.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   But as we do that, though,
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   I have a lot of people that listen to the show that are interested in the financial services business,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   and I'd love for you to sketch out a little bit about your background.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   How did you get into the business? What was your path through?
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   And where are you, and what do you do today?
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   Okay. Yeah, actually, I started in the business in '99,
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   which, of course, is the top of the market at the time, a wonderful time to start.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   I started right after college and started working at Cain Weber,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   who was acquired by UPS shortly after that.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   And that was in the wire house part of the industry, the big broker-dealers.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   And it was a good introduction to the industry.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   Actually, that was probably the first time I had sort of learned about self-directed IRAs,
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   because a client of mine had asked me if he could buy an LLC with his IRA,
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   and I'd never heard of that. They don't teach you that there.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   Definitely not.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   So I asked my manager, he said, "No, you can't do that."
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   I said, "All right." And he asked a few more questions.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   He's like, "Well, you can, but you probably don't want to."
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   I'm like, "All right, forget it."
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   And then a few years after that, I went over to Smith Barney,
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   which is now Morgan Stanley.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   They're starting to know its trend here.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   And when I was at Morgan Stanley, when I was at Smith Barney,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   I actually had a client.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   This is really when I first started getting into self-directed IRAs.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   And I had a client tell me that he was going to invest in a private note
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   or private mortgage through this individual,
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   and he wanted to use his retirement account.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.400]   I said I had no idea. I'd heard of that concept.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   I have no idea how to do it, but I'm happy to help you through the process.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   So I went through and learned as much as I could.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   Of course, I didn't get much help from Smith Barney.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   They pretty much told me the same answer of, "You can't do that."
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   So I went through the whole process and learned as much as I could,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   found some pretty good resources.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   There was a book at the time that I'd read,
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   and some of the custodians had provided some pretty good learning tools.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   And I walked through the process and learned quite a bit about it.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   And at that point, I had actually switched over to an independent broker-dealer,
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   not a Royal Alliance, because I was looking to expand on the alternative investment side
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   as well as the self-directed IRAs.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   And it was a little complicated.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   The broker-dealer side makes things challenging because of FINRA.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   So eventually, I ended up starting an RA with my current partner.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   One of our primary focuses was to be the experts in alternatives with self-directed IRAs
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   and 401(k)s as well.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.400]   So we pretty much started our current firm back in 2009.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   Of course, an interesting time to start.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   I had my same clients that I brought over, but this was actually a really good time
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   to get involved because people were looking outside of the stock market.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   So really, what we realized is...
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   I mean, I'm not aware of any other advisor that specializes in what we do.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   So, you know, dealing with alternatives is one component
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   because it's something that many people are not familiar with.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   And working with self-directed IRAs or 401(k)s is a whole other animal.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   Based on our research, 3% of the population is actually investing in alternatives
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.400]   with their IRA or 401(k)
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   and less than 20% -- I would estimate maybe 12% -- is even aware of the fact that it can be done.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   So you really have a huge potential marketplace of people that...
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   I mean, we like to say that people should invest in what they know.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   You know, if you're an expert in real estate, you shouldn't be investing in diamonds or horses.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.400]   You should invest in the real estate that you understand and know well.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   And I've found over the years that developers or people who have a background in real estate
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.400]   don't really want to put their money in mutual funds.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   The mentality of the real estate investors is they want to put every nickel they own into real estate.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   That's the way they operate.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   And when they become aware of the fact that they can actually do this,
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   their eyes just widen.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   I mean, it's just amazing to see people realize and say, "Really?"
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   It's an amazing conversation, let me tell you.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   I had an experience similar to yours with regards to being in mainstream finance.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   But I was with Northwestern Mutual.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   And Northwestern Mutual doesn't do any of that kind of alternative stuff.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   Very conservative, especially in investment management.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   Just very straightforward, very conservative, very traditional.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   But I somehow developed...
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   Not somehow.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.400]   I've always had the reputation as the weirdo.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   The guy who thought about all the stuff that no one else did.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   I'd have other advisors.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   And especially in the last...
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.400]   I would say since 2008,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   I've seen a much larger percentage of the population than I ever can figure out in the past
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   just simply lose their confidence in the mainstream approach
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   and desire something different, or at least something different with a portion of their assets.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   And so I was the guy that other advisors would say,
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   "Listen, I've got a client who's asking me about gold, gold coins. I don't have a clue."
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   And they would call me and say, "Joshua, what advice do I give a client?"
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.400]   Obviously, I can't do anything, but how do I steer this person in the right direction of buying gold coins?
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.400]   They see the ads on the cable news channels.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   How do I talk them through that in a rational way?
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   And so I was the guy who was answering those questions.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   Got to back off his planning for people.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.400]   And so that was one.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   And one of the things that I always got the questions on was,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   "How do I... I don't trust stocks. I got to get out of the stock market.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   But I got all my money in an IRA. What do I do?"
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   And that was what got me interested.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   It was kind of researching.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   How could we use the funds that are in a 401(k) or in an IRA or something like that?
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:51.400]   And how could we invest them a little bit more broadly than just whatever a mainstream basket of mutual funds might be?
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   And when I started learning about what was possible, I could never do that.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   And I admire you for going through the hassle of setting up the firm to work with that.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   I can't even imagine the challenge of setting up an RIA to service that type of business.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   And how do you find custodians? And how do you...
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   I want to hear more about it and your experience in doing that.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   So I always just referred people out.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   But I did always make... at least learn enough to say, "Here's how you can structure it."
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   Now, whether or not you're going to be able to find a service provider or not, that's a whole other question.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   But I got to imagine if your marketing is working, this has got to be in pretty good demand right now in 2015, right?
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   Yeah, and actually, setting up the firm is a funny story.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   So when we started looking to do this, originally we thought, "Hey, the broker-dealer route, we could do that."
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   And then talking with broker-dealers, it was pretty much a no-go.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   There was no way anybody was going to let us do it.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   Compliance for FINRA is just a nightmare. And they said, "We just don't want to deal with it."
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   So when we started, when we set up our RIA, we looked at a few different states.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.400]   We were looking at state registration at the time.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   And we looked at Maine and Massachusetts and New Jersey.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   And I don't want to call anybody out here, so I won't say the states.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   But let's just say one of the states, we said what we wanted to do.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   They said, "You don't need to be like this. Do that."
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   So we said, "All right, next."
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   [Laughter]
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.400]   And one of the other states that we had gone to,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.400]   originally, because within the first two years, they're supposed to give you an audit.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.400]   That's a regulation that we try to do.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   And so our first audit, we had gone through with the regulators and we told them what they were doing.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   And immediately they just got frenzied.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.400]   They said, "Wait a minute. You're doing all turnovers. Aren't those risky?"
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.400]   Right.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   "Risky like what? Risky like AIG? Like Lehman Brothers? Like Enron? What kind of risky are we talking about?"
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   And so it took a lot of education of the regulators to explain that risk management,
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   which is a key cornerstone of what we do,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:18.400]   risk management is not about whether an asset is publicly traded or whether it's an alternative.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   It's about the asset itself.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   So AIG was AAA rated at the time.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.400]   There's no higher rating.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   So you could argue that they were one of the safest stocks around, but that turned out to be not true.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   On the other hand, you could say investing in a piece of rentable property down the street is risky.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   But you live close. It's a rental property.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.400]   You can do the numbers. You know what the risks are.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   You can mitigate the risks by making sure you have enough insurance,
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.400]   by making sure that you have good tenants and other forms.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   The risk of an asset is not determined based on how some third party characterizes it.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.400]   It's really how you're looking at the risk and how you feel comfortable with them and can mitigate them.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   So we had a number of interesting conversations with regulators.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:18.400]   We've taught them how to assess the risks of alternatives as opposed to just saying it's risky because it's an alternative.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   I think that is an industry norm that needs to be dispelled.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:30.400]   But I found that we're hyper-focused on compliance.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:38.400]   We actually set the bar higher than is what is expected because we understand we're playing in a unique space.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   If anybody comes to play at the playground, we want to make sure everybody else is abiding by those standards.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   Because all it takes is one bad seat and then everybody else is painted with a bad brush.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:14:01.400]   We're very focused on making sure all the rules are abided by.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   There are gray areas with this, but we make sure that we're in the lighter part of the gray.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   Certainly anything that... there's case law that changes all the time and they change the rules occasionally.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:22.400]   So we have to make sure that we're up to speed on that and make sure that clients are in compliance.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.400]   I think that's, from our perspective, it's very important.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:37.400]   There are a number of people who try to invest in alternatives in an IRA themselves without advice.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   And we come across a lot of errors that probably shouldn't happen.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   And I think it's unfortunate, but because of the lack of knowledge in this area, people tend to make mistakes more often than they should.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:15:02.400]   Especially, I would imagine, because this area of planning is going to attract a lot of hype, shall we say.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:13.400]   A lot of times, the truth, you can be pretty close to it and just a tiny bit over, and that tiny bit over could wind up being an expensive mistake.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   I want to talk a lot about how to do this.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   And obviously, certainly, you can mention how you work with people, but I also just want to explain to people the general framework of how, if this is of interest to them, they could do it.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   I don't want to spend too much time talking about alternative investments, but I do think we need to start there to lay the framework.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   And you mentioned in your advertising material, very straightforward, and this is what shocked me when I finally figured it out,
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:46.400]   that there are actually only a few types of investments that are prohibited from IRAs, based upon my understanding.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   And correct me anywhere along the line I get it wrong, because you are much more well-versed in this than I am.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:59.400]   But you can't invest in life insurance contracts, you cannot invest in S-corporation stocks, and you can't invest in collectibles.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   So, you can't buy artwork.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   But outside of that, pretty much just about the whole world of investing is available to you.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   And you post a list on your site of ideas of different things that can be invested in with a self-directed account.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:32.400]   And including real estate, tax liens, private mortgages, farmland, timberland, airspace rights, mineral rights, precious metals,
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   private businesses or franchises, as long as they are structured either as an LLC or as a C-corporation,
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:48.400]   private equity, venture capital, medical equipment leasing, horses, livestock, payday loans, title loans, etc.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   Is there any other restriction of what you can invest in as long as you stay away from life insurance contracts, S-corporations, or collectibles?
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:03.400]   Is there anything else other than that that you can't use as an investment inside of a self-directed account?
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:11.400]   Well, I mean, Joshua, I think you can appreciate this based on the nature of your podcast, that you're, you know, you think outside the box creatively.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   And I think the nice part about this space is that it allows you to be very creative in the way that you do things.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   So, the restrictions or the prohibited assets inside of an IRA are, as you stated, S-corps, life insurance, and collectibles.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   However, as with a lot of things in this space, there are rules and there are exceptions to those rules.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.400]   And in some cases, there are exceptions to those exceptions.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   So, to give you an example, so you cannot invest in life insurance.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   But technically, you can't invest in life insurance on yourself.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   You can invest in life settlements, life insurance contracts on other people.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   You know, you can't invest in collectibles, but you can invest in a business that markets collectibles or sells collectibles.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   So, there are different subtleties around the rules that can be done.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   And I think that, you know, there are enough ways to get things done the way that you need to get them done.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:29.400]   It's not, you know, we're not breaking any rules. We're not, I mean, believe me when I say this, you know, we're not playing in the charcoal area of the gray.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:41.400]   You know, we make sure that there's absolutely no shadow of a doubt that somebody would ever get a disqualified transaction through any of these things.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   Because, you know, as an IRA, we're fiduciaries.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   So, we have a lot of liability on the hook.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   This isn't just a here, go do it yourself. We're on the hook as well.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   I think that's an important consideration that people understand is that we're in it together with them.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   So, we want to make sure that it's done right.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   Now, another example of things that are misunderstood is we had a client who was looking to buy physical gold and silver inside of his 401k, his company's 401k plan.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   So, we went through lengthy discussions with them.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:27.400]   We interviewed a depository. We had interviewed dealers, coin dealers.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   We actually even met with the, we spoke with the ICTA, which is the Intangible Council.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   I forget the exact title of it.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   But at the time, their stance was this cannot be done.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   You cannot invest in gold in your IRA unless it's kept with a dealer.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   Dealer meaning a primary dealer like a JP Morgan, a bullion bank, if you will.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   And it would have to be housed there.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   But, you know, if anybody has looked at buying gold and really has thought through all of the different risks,
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:18.400]   one of the risks that many people in that circle think about is, you know, with the bullion banks, is that gold there?
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   Are there ETFs? Do they actually house the gold?
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   And if somebody wants to buy gold coins for keeping it out of the system, the last place they want to put it at is one of the banks that...
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   Exactly. It's a little different.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   If you're worried about making sure that you have gold in case of the zombie apocalypse,
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   there's a big difference between holding a one-ounce gold American Eagle, you know, in your gun safe
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   versus having a piece of paper that indicates that the gold ETF actually has this somewhere in some mythical location.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   Right. So we had read through the rules and we actually came up with a solution to that
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:05.400]   and explained it to them and they concurred after speaking with their counsel that that was a valid way to do it.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:12.400]   But, you know, one of the things that I like is that we challenge the boundaries, you know.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:18.400]   We make sure that, you know, my business partner is probably one of the foremost experts in this area
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:25.400]   and you could call him the library with no books. You know, he understands things off the tip of his...
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.400]   Why am I talking to you then? Why didn't you just send me to him?
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   What's the point of this conversation?
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.400]   You know, vacation.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   Join himself.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   But my point is that there are a lot of different subtleties and things that can be done
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   and I think that even some of the other rules like prohibited transaction and disqualified persons,
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:02.400]   there are ways to, I don't want to say circumvent them, but ways to work within the rules
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.400]   that you can get things accomplished that need to be done.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:15.400]   So I think it's a nice part about this space that allows you to be creative and allows you to think outside the box.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.400]   You know, and there are multiple ways to get things accomplished.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   So some people, I'll give you an example, a big, hot, very heavily advertised area is the checkbook LLC
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.400]   or the checkbook IRA.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.400]   Right.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   And it's a complicated area because it's marketed as a way for people to hide the assets that they're investing in their IRA
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   and to have full authority to invest in whatever they want.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:59.400]   And a lot of people take that as a license to break the rules because if you didn't have the LLC to shield it
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   and you were to invest in those assets at the custodian, the custodian would flat out tell you no
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.400]   if it wasn't something that was legal or allowed.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   So some people take that as an opportunity to do what they want.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:18.400]   And in the face of that, many of the larger custodians have flat out said,
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   "We will not accept a checkbook LLC as an asset."
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   And some of them have actually required a special advisor to be listed on that account
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:37.400]   to make sure that they are overseeing the account to make sure that everything is above board.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:45.400]   So we are one of the special advisors at some custodians that are allowed to oversee it and advise on that.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.400]   But there's enormous liability for them if they allow it, which is why they've--
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.400]   they actually shut it down for a few years and didn't allow it at all.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:00.400]   And they started to recently open it back up after discussions with some other attorneys and accountants
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   that are also specialized in this area.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   And they said, "Look, you can't just not do this. You have to put more guidance on there."
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   So they did, which is great.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   So I think that's an area that is-- there's potential issues with.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   I mean, flat out, the checkbook LLC is no different than the IRA in that the rules don't change.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.400]   You still have the same rules that apply.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:33.400]   The only difference is you don't have somebody else overseeing what the assets are.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:39.400]   And, you know, some people like that, and that's fine, but it doesn't mean the rules change.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   The LLC is a flow-through, so it's not as if you have a different set of rules for that.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:54.400]   I can't imagine why anybody in this space would actually want to do and engage in prohibited transactions
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.400]   but just put up with a shield.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   When you're dealing with accounts like this, you've got the most public accounts that you could possibly come up with.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   And if you want to invest privately, just skip the whole thing and go invest privately.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:14.400]   If you want to break rules and break law, then go and just work in the free market.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.400]   Go work in the black market.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.400]   So I don't understand why people approach it that way.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   Where I look at it is people that will follow very carefully the letter of the law
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:28.400]   but are looking to do a little bit more hands-on, focused investing
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.400]   and are just looking to structure their affairs in the most straightforward ways.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.400]   I don't see why anyone would push it to the point of investing in prohibited assets.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   What types of accounts--go ahead.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   Go ahead, Fiorillo, just respond.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   I was going to say, so one of the reasons possibly is that people don't understand the repercussions.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:00.400]   Let me give you an example because I think this will illustrate it as clearly as anybody would ever need.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:06.400]   We were aware of an individual, and we were kind of brought into the fray a little late to do anything,
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:13.400]   but we were aware of an individual who had bought bus shelters inside of his IRA.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.400]   Bus shelters?
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   Yes, it's an interesting business.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.400]   He bought bus shelters and sold advertising off of them.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.400]   Interesting. Okay, go ahead.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   So that's his business, and he did very well at it.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   He seemed to grow his assets quite substantially.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   And this individual is the engineer type, you know, dots every I, crosses every T, knows every rule inside and out.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.400]   I mean, this guy, you know, he didn't make mistakes.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   And unfortunately, it wasn't his mistake that was the problem because he followed the rules.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.400]   But at the time, what was required was a qualified custodian.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.400]   And what he used was an individual who said he was a qualified custodian,
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.400]   but in actuality he wasn't.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:08.400]   And what happened was the, I think the IRS, maybe it was another federal agency,
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:16.400]   but I think it was the IRS, had basically caught him defrauding people.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.400]   And of course what they do is they don't catch you when you make a mistake.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.400]   They catch somebody else, and then they go through their list.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.400]   They say, "Oh, look at all these people who this guy's got over.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:33.400]   Let's see who we can add to our list of people we can get tax dollars from."
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.400]   So in going down the list, they said, "Oh, here's one guy.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.400]   He didn't use a qualified custodian."
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.400]   And they took him to court over it.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   And of course, you know, this guy totally was defrauded.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.400]   It wasn't his fault.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:53.400]   And it ended up that this guy had millions in his IRA.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   It might have been over $10,000, I don't remember.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   I think it's public record.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   And basically he ended up losing it all because what happens is when you create
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   a prohibited transaction today and they don't find out about it for 10 years,
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:15.400]   the IRS looks at that prohibited transaction and says, "Okay, that's a distribution."
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.400]   So as of this year, you owe us taxes and penalties on all of the funds
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   that you've taken out.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   Of course, you didn't know that.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.400]   So we're talking 10 years later, all of those taxes and penalties and interest
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:34.400]   accrue and ended up with this guy lost everything.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:41.400]   And out of sheer goodwill from the judge who just felt sorry for him,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:48.400]   he said, "I'll give you a one-time tax-free transfer of $1 million into a Roth IRA."
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   Wow.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   So he said, "Look, you can start again."
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   I laughed thinking about it, like, "Wow, that's a nice gesture."
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.400]   But if this guy had $10 million-plus and he's getting $1 million,
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.400]   that's still a kick in the gut.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.400]   Wow.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   But the point is he would have lost everything in his IRA because of a mistake
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   that he technically made but wasn't his fault.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.400]   So if you can imagine that that's how harsh they are on people like that,
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.400]   imagine how harsh they're going to be on somebody who is deliberately breaking the rules.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   Absolutely.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   So it's very important that people understand that the rules are--they need to be obeyed.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   So, for instance, one type of transaction is if you own a rental property,
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.400]   you cannot rent it out to a disqualified person.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.400]   And a disqualified person would be somebody who is in your immediate family,
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:56.400]   so it would be your lineal ascendants and descendants.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:02.400]   And so if you rent the place out to your mother or your son or daughter,
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.400]   that's a prohibited transaction.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   If the roof leaks or the toilet breaks and you go fix it, that's a prohibited transaction.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.400]   If you go fix it yourself because you're not--explain that one.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.400]   If you go fix it yourself and you don't hire it done, that's what you're referring to?
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   Right.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.400]   You can do what they call a settler function.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   You can pay the bills.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.400]   You can pay taxes.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.400]   You can hire people.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.400]   But you can't do what they call sweat equity.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.400]   You can't swing a hammer or paint the fence.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.400]   That's sweat equity, and they don't allow that because they couldn't value it.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.400]   So that's why they don't allow it.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   So effectively, you have to be cautious of that.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   If you have hunting land, you can't go hunt on your own land.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   You basically can't take a personal benefit from your IRA.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:06.400]   You have to look at your IRA as a local neighbor that you really don't like,
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.400]   and you would treat that IRA in the same way you would treat that person.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.400]   So you wouldn't give them money.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.400]   You wouldn't expect them to give you money.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   You wouldn't expect them to let you use their car.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.400]   These type of things, you have to consider it as a completely separate entity and person,
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   and you cannot take personal benefit from that IRA, even though technically you have control over it.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   So those are important considerations, and there are certain things that can be done.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.400]   For instance, if somebody wanted to buy a property and rent it out for 10 years
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:50.400]   and eventually retire there, they could take a distribution of that property and then use it.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   But during the time that it's in the IRA, it can't be done.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:01.400]   And, you know, in the case of real estate, if you have a property and you do need a roof,
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   and you don't want to have an IRA worth $100,000 and you spend that entire $100,000 on a piece of property,
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   and then the roof breaks and costs you, say, $10,000, that has to come from the IRA.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   It can't come from your pocket.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:23.400]   So you have to consider the fact that if you're buying it out of your pocket,
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.400]   you have no cash to spend on the roof.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   It's the same consideration. You have to find some place to get it.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:39.400]   So I think things like that are important to understand about the self-directed IRA,
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:47.400]   is that people have to think through all the different risks and things that can happen with their investments
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.400]   and really just make sure that they're following the rules.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.400]   And the rules are not complex.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:03.400]   There are exceptions to a lot of areas, but as long as somebody is not trying to get too tricky with their investment,
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   it's generally really easy to follow the rules.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:16.400]   So you keep referring to self-directed IRA, but obviously there are multiple types of IRAs,
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.400]   and then there are various other types of accounts that can also be self-directed.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   What are the different types of accounts with which you can set up a self-directed strategy
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:35.400]   to have a bit more flexibility in your investment plan, and what are the ones that you're not able to set up?
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   Okay, so when I refer to a self-directed IRA, that has a broad scope.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   So that includes the traditional IRA, the Roth IRA, Simple IRA, SIP IRA,
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   Coverdell Education Savings Account, and the -- well, I should say the Coverdell and the HSA,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.400]   Health Savings Account, are a little bit different.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.400]   But it also includes 401(k) plans.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   So typically the traditional and the Roth IRA and the SIP and the Simple IRAs more or less have the same rules
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.400]   when it comes to investments.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.400]   The Coverdell and the HSAs are a little bit different.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:34.400]   Unfortunately, due to some of the way that they're structured, it makes it hard to use them for alternative investments.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   Like, for instance, the Coverdell Education Savings Account, the annual contribution limit is $2,000.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   So it kind of limits what can be invested in there just by sheer nature of the amount of assets that you have to get in there to grow it.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:56.400]   Now, I've seen people take small amounts of money and turn it into large amounts of money.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:02.400]   I actually wrote a piece about this, about the $100 million IRA, which we can talk about later.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   It can be done, and creatively you can certainly amplify returns if you know what you're doing.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:20.400]   But the HSA, unfortunately, as great of a structure as it is, effectively you're contributing pre-tax money.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   Assuming you have a high-deductible health plan, you can set one of these up, you contribute at pre-tax,
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:35.400]   and the money comes out tax-free as long as it's used for medical expenses, which is great.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   It's the best thing I've seen when it comes to account structures.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   Unfortunately, due to all the paperwork required by the custodians, very few custodians have these.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:58.400]   I've found some at a local bank that are really, you know, they don't cost money, they're free, or they're low fees.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:04.400]   Some brokerage houses have them with only mutual funds as an option.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:13.400]   But with most of the self-directed IRA custodians, most of them have just said no because the paperwork is just too costly for them to do.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   Also, the market isn't big enough. There just aren't enough people who have enough assets saved to make it worthwhile for them.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:27.400]   So that's unfortunate, and I really hope that changes because that is a great account for people to use.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   And then there's the 401(k), which is very similar to the self-directed IRA,
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   but the self-directed 401(k) also has some other benefits to it, certainly higher contribution limits and some other pieces as well.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:51.400]   Unfortunately, with the 401(k), it really is more geared towards somebody who is in control of their company.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:58.400]   So if somebody has their own business and maybe works with a spouse, they can set up a solo pay,
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:04.400]   but if they work for a company of 50, 100 people and it's not their company,
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   then there's probably very little they can do to expand beyond the traditional options of mutual funds.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:21.400]   I've found it's hard to twist the arm of the higher-ups unless they personally see a benefit in doing it for themselves.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   I can't even imagine the scenario in which I, if I were the CEO of a 30-person company,
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   that I would permit this degree of flexibility in a 401(k) plan.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   Just the responsibility, the level of sophistication needed to invest successfully here,
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:50.400]   and just the level of self-responsibility, I can't imagine authorizing it.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   I wouldn't do it. I would offer a menu of straightforward mutual funds.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.400]   I mean, am I wrong? I just can't imagine.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:07.400]   I see so many mistakes made with straightforward mutual funds that for me to give a degree of...
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:14.400]   I've worked with some clients who are attorneys, and I looked at their accounts,
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.400]   and they permitted some self-direction, primarily individual stocks.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.400]   And I mean, the majority of people get hammered on those things.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:26.400]   And I can't imagine being convinced that it would be in the best interest of my employees
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.400]   unless all 30 of my employees were--unless we were doing a private equity group,
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   and my name is Mitt Romney, and I know my guys are all experts. Am I wrong?
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.400]   Well, I think that you're--I mean, you really hit the nail on the head,
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:47.400]   because what I've found is that with many companies, there's a few dynamics at work.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.400]   The first is the hurting behavior.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:39:01.400]   So just like mutual fund managers, most HR--heads of HR or plan trustees--are worried about their own tail,
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.400]   and they have liability issues.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   So the way they look at it is, "Well, if I offer 10 different mutual funds,
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   then my liability is really, really low because everybody else is doing it."
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.400]   Exactly.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.400]   I mean, it's the right thing, but if everybody else is doing it, I can hide in the herd of sheep,
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.400]   and I won't get in trouble.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:26.400]   And, you know, there's some--I mean, you know, most--the other thing is,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:33.400]   most of these people that work at corporations, larger corporations or mid-sized corporations,
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.400]   most of them are not financial professionals.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.400]   They're not astute investors.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:44.400]   They're doing what they're told or what has been told through, you know, their own education.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   I mean, you know, the HR professionals have some education, this degree,
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.400]   but they're not financial professionals, so they don't know one mutual fund from another.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   They don't know how to research them and dissect them and know, you know, which one's better and which one's worse.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:05.400]   So, you know, I can't completely blame them because it's not their professional expertise,
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:11.400]   but on the other hand, they are offering options to people that--
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:20.400]   a perfect example, it's--and I see this way too frequently, in that there are five to ten offerings.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.400]   Many times, most of them are the same asset class.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:33.400]   And, you know, they--you know, even if they have an S&P 500 index fund, it would be much cheaper to use an ETF.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.400]   You could do the same thing, accomplish the same goals,
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:42.400]   but it's--there are certain standards in the industry that are accepted and for many reasons,
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.400]   they continue on along that path.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:53.400]   So I think with an alternative, with a 401(k) plan, it's obviously a lot more complicated
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:57.400]   because in the real issue for, let's say, a 20-person company,
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   and they've got 15 people that are really knowledgeable about that one investment,
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   let's just say they were going to buy the building that they're renting.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.400]   So they have the office space, they're going to buy that building,
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.400]   and they're going to rent from themselves, and they're going to also rent it to, you know,
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.400]   ten other unit owners or however many people in the building.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.400]   And they want to do it within their 401(k) plan.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.400]   So people at the company know the building, they know the other tenants, and they're comfortable with it.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.400]   The problem isn't the knowledgeable people.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   The problem is there's always, let's say, one or two, let's say, lower-end people, maybe,
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   not an intern per se, but somebody out of college, or maybe, you know,
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   a secretary that doesn't really follow the company's business or, you know, is maybe new.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   But, you know, there's people that are less knowledgeable about the business itself,
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   and those are the people that you also have to cater to.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.400]   I don't want to call it the lowest common denominator,
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:02.400]   but that's what the rules require you to adhere to is that everybody, you know,
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.400]   follows under the same rules.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   So you couldn't offer an alternative investment plan to only three people out of 20.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.400]   That would be against the rules that would not be allowed.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.400]   You would have to offer it to all 20.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.400]   Now, they don't all have to invest in it, but it has to be offered to everybody.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:27.400]   And then, of course, you know, it's the last thing the plan trustee wants is someone to come in
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.400]   and say, "Hey, what about this person?
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.400]   This could be an issue," but it's only an issue when something goes wrong, right?
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.400]   It's a different issue when people make mistakes.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.400]   So, you know, that's one of the issues.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:45.400]   I mean, we do see it frequently where a lot of professional service groups, doctors,
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:51.400]   dentists, accountants, attorneys, you know, they have their own practice,
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.400]   and a lot of them, you know, buy their own building or, you know,
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   some real estate where they can rent out.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:03.400]   And that's a very common investment for those people just because of their location.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   And it's a little bit easier to do that, but, you know,
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   if somebody wanted to invest in physical gold coins or horses,
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   it's a little bit further of a stretch that that's an acceptable investment
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:21.400]   unless everybody really has the same background and expertise.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:26.400]   So that is one of the downsides of the 401(k) with alternatives is it's a lot harder
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.400]   to make those things work appropriately for everybody.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:37.400]   But, you know, certainly you can--you know, there are ways that you can do it.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.400]   You just have to be really, really careful.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   And, you know, if you have a solo pay or a smaller company,
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   it's a lot easier to work with that because, you know, if you're a solo pay,
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.400]   you've got yourself and your spouse.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.400]   You don't have to worry too much about the other parties.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.400]   That's exactly where I was going to go is I see the real benefit here.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.400]   Although it is nice if you could get a professional practice group together
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.400]   and if it were structured in such a way that there could be enough agreement
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   that an alternative investment could work.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   But if you take a highly productive--something like a consulting firm
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:20.400]   or, you know, even a blog, you know, some of the very small businesses
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   where a solo pay can work, I mean, you can put--and especially husband and wife.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.400]   Like if my business were financially productive enough
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   and my wife and I are the only employees and we set one of these things up
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.400]   and I put $50,000 in for me and we write the documents
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.400]   and she could put $50,000 in for her,
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.400]   now I've got $100,000 a year that I can get into the account
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:48.400]   with my contributions and my deferrals.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.400]   Now all of a sudden I can start to get some money here
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.400]   and we can start to have some fun with the investment allocation there.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:01.400]   Or the people who are coming from a firm and now we've got a large IRA balance
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.400]   and we want to take, you know, $300,000 or half a million
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.400]   and this is the money that we're going to keep in a separate self-directed IRA
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.400]   and employ it strategically.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.400]   That's where I see the real opportunity.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:19.400]   Right, and I think that's certainly the easier scenario to work with.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:25.400]   I mean, you know, I know we get calls frequently from people with smaller amounts
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.400]   that are trying to do something big with them.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.400]   And, you know, from a fee perspective, from the custodian, it can be a challenge.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   You know, if you have $10,000 and you're looking to invest in small partners,
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:43.400]   you really have to make the performance higher to account for the fees
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.400]   because it's not like a brokerage account, e-trade or a merit trade
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   or fidelity where it might be a $10 trade.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.400]   You know, they charge us a percentage of assets
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   or they charge it per transaction or both.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.400]   And there are many different fee models, so depending on if you're going to buy
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.400]   and hold something for 20 years, you might want the transaction model,
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:11.400]   whereas if you're doing 20 transactions a month, you might want the fee model.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:17.400]   So it would depend on what you're doing, but I think that that's--you're right.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   It definitely is a better type of setup for highly compensated people
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   that are also highly educated.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.400]   And you mentioned before--and I'll pick you up on this on Mitt Romney--
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:43.400]   that the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, they had done a study a few months back.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   And this study basically said that there are--let me pull it up here.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:58.400]   There are 314 people in the U.S. that have an IRA of over $25 million.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.400]   And there are 791 between $10 and $25 million,
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   and there are a little under 8,000 people between $5 and $10 million.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   And this is out of 42, 43 million people.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   So there are very few people--and, you know, it's rare that I've seen
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.400]   an IRA over $2 million because it's just--back in the late '90s you saw it quite frequently,
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:29.400]   but now you don't see it as frequently.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:35.400]   And when Mitt Romney ran for president a few years back because of his disclosures,
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:43.400]   it came out that he has an IRA of over $102,104 million.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.400]   Now you'd say, you know, that's crazy. How is that possible?
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:52.400]   And I think there are a few different subtleties that I think he took advantage of
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.400]   that are completely legal.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:02.400]   But I think also, I mean, you know, he--this gets back to the invest and what you know philosophy--
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.400]   is that, you know, he was investing in private equity bills as a gain capital.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:12.400]   He had access to a lot of different deals because of his position.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:19.400]   His firm did a lot of deals. And one of the benefits of the self-directed IRA is you can--
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:25.400]   if you really understand how the rules work and you have access to really good investments,
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.400]   you can be creative and really amp up your returns.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:34.400]   And this is not saying that everybody should do this because not everybody is an expert in every area,
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:41.400]   but, you know, with the private equity deals, I think what he--a lot of what he was doing,
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:45.400]   it would require him if he maxed out every year based on his employment,
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   he would have to get about 20% returns a year, which isn't that much,
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:55.400]   considering some of those deals, you know, prove hundreds of percents of return.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:01.400]   So I think that, you know, if he can do that with--and I think that's obviously an extreme.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:06.400]   That's an extreme end of the spectrum. There's probably not too many people who have done more.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:13.400]   Peter Peerfield, one of the original investors in Facebook, and people who have read the book
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:21.400]   or watched the movie, "The Social Network," it's--you know, he was the original investor.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.400]   And he's--I mean, his name's been out there. I think people have heard of him before.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.400]   Right.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:33.400]   He did--similar, he invested in Facebook with his Roth IRA when it was, you know, pennies a share.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:40.400]   So, you know, here's a guy who's made tens of millions of dollars in his Roth IRA from one investment.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:47.400]   So it's plausible that these people can, you know, generate large returns inside of a tax-free
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:52.400]   or tax-deferred account. But it doesn't mean that other people can't do something similar.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:58.400]   I mean, you don't need to make $100 million. You can make $1 million if you invest prudently
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   over a number of years. And you contribute, obviously. Contributions are a big part of it.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:13.400]   So I think it's--there are certain types of professions that have access to certain--
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.400]   certain professions have access to certain types of investments.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:23.400]   I'll give you another example. We had a client who had a farm in Pennsylvania, and he trained corsage horses.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:28.400]   Nobody--if you haven't heard of corsage horses, you won't be long, because I hadn't either before this.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   These are the type of horses that dance. So there's a certain type of horse that dance.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:45.400]   You know, it was--I wasn't involved with this transaction per se, but I found it to be extremely interesting.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   Right.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.400]   So they would--so the farm, they would buy the horses from over in Europe, and they would train them,
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:55.400]   and they would sell them to very, very, very rich people.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:02.400]   And, you know, the returns they'd get on that horse were, you know, quite substantial.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   But this is something they knew. This was their business. This was their bread and butter.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:10.400]   So they understood the transaction. They figured, well, if I could do this inside of a Roth IRA,
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.400]   why wouldn't I?
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:21.400]   So I think many people have the opportunity to consider different investments that they know well
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:27.400]   and would have probably a lower risk in because they understand it better than most people.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:33.400]   So I think that's really a key important component of, you know, of investing.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.400]   Well, it doesn't have to be a self-directed IRA. It could be traditional investments.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   It doesn't really matter as long as you understand the investments well. That's really the important piece.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:51.400]   Yeah. I couldn't stand the criticism that Romney got at that time.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.400]   I get so frustrated by the political commentary.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.400]   We all have exactly the same tax code.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:02.400]   There's no special tax code for Mitt Romney versus tax code for Joshua Sheets.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.400]   We all function under the identical tax code.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:11.400]   And the question is, how much work are we able to put in to understanding a certain part of the market,
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.400]   to finding something that we can exploit an opportunity in,
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:21.400]   and/or how much money do we have to pay smart people to sit down and figure out solutions for us?
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.400]   And we all are dealing with exactly the same tax code.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.400]   It frustrates me so much, and I know it's a dead end when we get into politics,
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   but no matter how things are written, unless you just simply remove all of the rules
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:43.400]   and make things so dirt simple that it's not worth it to do all the work to try to find something different,
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:46.400]   the rich are always going to get better returns than the poor,
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.400]   because the rich can afford to pay people like you and me,
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   and people ten times smarter than us, and ten times more well-versed in the law than us,
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:58.400]   to sit and read the code, and go through 70,000 pages,
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.400]   and find the way that things can be structured creatively.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.400]   We all have the same opportunities, is my point.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:12.400]   Now, certainly, I'm not saying that we all have the same opportunity as accredited investors,
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:18.400]   as part of a private equity firm, today, to go in and start structuring deals,
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:23.400]   and understand someone who can do discounted shares for limited marketability,
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   and figure out how to do some carried interest and transfer that interest over into the--
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.400]   I'm not saying we all have that opportunity,
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:35.400]   but there's no reason why any single person listening couldn't be there in 15 or 20 years if they wanted to.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.400]   That's my point.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.400]   I would agree with you wholeheartedly.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:44.400]   I think that one of the nice parts about this country is the opportunity,
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:50.400]   and there are a lot of tax-advantaged investment types.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:55.400]   If you look at MLPs or REITs or a host of different things that can be done,
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.400]   there's no one solution.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:03.400]   And you're right, the wealthy have access to better advisors, because better advisors cost more.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:09.400]   Most people couldn't afford to pay them, but the Internet is a wonderful thing.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:16.400]   If you look 20 years ago, you probably had to go to the library to find these things.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.400]   I don't even remember that far back.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:23.400]   But right now with the Internet, you can find the answers to most of this stuff.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.400]   It's available online.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   You may not be able to easily find an attorney that can craft the perfect contract for you
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:38.400]   that will get you what you want, but there are rules that anybody can find.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:44.400]   And the way that our tax code is structured obviously benefits the rich to some extent,
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.400]   even though they do pay higher taxes.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   But the benefits are there because they pay higher taxes.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   I don't buy that.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:56.400]   And if you can prove that to me--I know that's the politically correct thing to say--
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.400]   but if you can prove that to me, I'll buy it.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.400]   But every single loophole in the tax code benefits the poor.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.400]   The entire thing is structured to benefit the poor.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:11.400]   And I mean, I can't find--I'm not an expert at tax,
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   but I've been studying it and studying it and studying it and studying it,
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   and all I find is exactly the same law applied to every class, to every income class,
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.400]   or extra benefits to low-income earners.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:31.400]   I mean, do you see something different than I do?
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.400]   No, I would agree with you, although I will point out that I think you were the first person
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   to ever call me politically correct.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.400]   Okay.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.400]   I've never been accused of that before.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:45.400]   That's one thing I could say that's probably below on the list.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   But, no, I would agree with you.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.400]   I think that everything is available to everybody.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:57.400]   There's nothing saying that unless you make this amount of money you can't participate in this.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   A lot of this is attributable to scale.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   And I think one of the unfortunate parts about our country is our media tends to exaggerate things
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   to get a reaction out of people which doesn't need to be there.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:21.400]   So, for instance, taking a fact of, you know, this amount of people--you know,
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.400]   I'm trying to remember the fact.
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:28.400]   It was maybe like probably the last election that's just when this stuff comes up.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:32.400]   They were looking at what percentage of the population pays what percent of taxes.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   Right.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.400]   And they said, well, you know, the 5% of the population pays like 85% of the tax
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.400]   or whatever it was.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:43.400]   But when you actually dig into the numbers and look at what they're saying, it's not really true.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.400]   What they're doing is taking one point, blowing it out of proportion,
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.400]   and people just eat it up.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.400]   They just assume it's true.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:52.400]   They don't bother to research it and look through it and say, well, actually,
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.400]   it's not true based on this, this, and this.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   So I do agree with you.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.400]   I think opportunity is available to everybody.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:09.400]   And it really comes down to people who are smart enough and have enough tenacity to go look for these things.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:13.400]   You know, and as I said, the internet is a wonderful thing.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.400]   It's there as a resource tool.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.400]   I mean, there's a lot of garbage out there, but there's certainly a lot of great information.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.400]   I mean, the IRS has everything online.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:28.400]   You know, the University of Cornell has all of the tax--all of the laws online.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.400]   The information is there.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.400]   It's not hidden from people.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.400]   You can easily find this stuff.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:37.400]   You don't even have to go to a library anymore.
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:41.400]   So, you know, the tax code is certainly not my forte.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:45.400]   I mean, we know the areas that we specialize in, but, you know,
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:51.400]   there's a lot of areas that people get paid very good money to be experts in,
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.400]   and, you know, that's what experts are for, right?
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:59.400]   They specialize and they're there to help people who want certain things in that area.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:04.400]   You know, I don't mind having a good debate with somebody over a certain policy objective,
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.400]   but I can't stand it when a debate is predicated based on lies.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:13.400]   And that's what I find so frustrating, is that we have a majority of our population--
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:16.400]   and this is my data, not anything I'm citing--
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:21.400]   a majority of our population is massively ignorant when it comes to tax law.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:26.400]   I have asked hundreds of people, "How much did you pay in income tax last year?"
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:33.400]   And the vast majority of them immediately say, "Oh, I got back, you know, about $500."
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:38.400]   I say, "No, how much did you pay in income tax last year?"
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   "Oh, I don't know."
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:45.400]   And I have not yet met in the years that I've been doing this,
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:49.400]   the hundreds of people I've talked to, I've not yet met the employee--
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.400]   and the business owners know this number--
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:55.400]   but the employee that can tell me how much of their paycheck on a percentage basis
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:58.400]   is deducted for their employment taxes.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.400]   And so when you're wandering away,
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:08.400]   and you lose 7.65% of your income as an employee right off the top,
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.400]   and you don't even know what that number is,
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.400]   and we're all bickering about how do I get a 2% raise,
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.400]   you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.400]   and you don't even know what that number is,
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:22.400]   you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.

[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:20.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:44.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.400]   And so you're losing 7.65% of your income right off the top.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.400]   And I think, you know, if people--
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:59.400]   in many cases, I will warn people if they're thinking of doing that,
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   you don't sign up the offer in your own name because otherwise you can't do it.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:10.400]   You know, with the contract, it has to explicitly state that the IRA is signing it, not you.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:19.400]   As with all documentation, it's very important that the individual IRA account owner never signs anything.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.400]   The custodian always signs documents.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:26.400]   And if the owner ever signs a document, that could actually create a prohibited transaction.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.400]   So they should be aware of that.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.400]   But I think you're right.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   The scale is very important.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:40.400]   You know, if you're going to invest in a self-directed IRA for 6%, you know,
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:45.400]   given the deflationary environment that we're in, that could actually--you could rate a return.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.400]   But I think ideally you don't want to shoot for that.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.400]   You probably want to aim a little higher if you can.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.400]   [laughter]
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.400]   I'm with you there.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:22:01.400]   That leads me perfectly to kind of the last, I guess, question basically that I had,
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:10.400]   which is I'd love your insight into custodians and the people that are involved in someone--in this type of transaction.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:18.400]   Most people are not aware of the, I guess, the parties that need to be involved in a 401(k).
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:24.400]   Most people, if you say--many people who are employees, if you say, okay, TPA, what's a TPA?
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.400]   What's a custodian?
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.400]   What do you refer?
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.400]   What are you talking about?
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   So could you walk through the major parties that are involved in a self-directed account,
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.400]   let's just stick with a self-directed IRA,
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:43.400]   and then how you find those different people and, for example, we mentioned one of the things that's tough is
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:47.400]   how do you find a custodian who's willing to work with a health savings account?
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:53.400]   So who are the parties that are involved, and to what extent can you get people out of it,
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:58.400]   and to what extent do you have to hire these different roles done to follow the rules?
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.400]   Okay.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:07.400]   So the first person--so if you want to open up a self-directed IRA, you have to find a custodian,
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:12.400]   and we have actually a good piece of choosing a self-directed custodian
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:20.400]   because I think it's an important component that is--it's not--the terminology is not clear
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.400]   in a lot of the advertising and marketing that people do.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:30.400]   So just to put it simply, there are brokerage firms which more or less buy and sell stock.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.400]   It's the easiest way to describe it.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.400]   There are custodians which custody assets.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:40.400]   A brokerage firm can also be a custodian, but rather than confusing their listeners,
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.400]   I'll just keep it separate.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:50.400]   So a custodian would be the type of firm that would hold--that would custody the IRA account,
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.400]   and they would hold all the assets that are there.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.400]   They do the recordkeeping.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.400]   They deal with the tax component of it.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:01.400]   They at least send you the tax statements anyway.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:02.400]   But they deal with that component.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:06.400]   So custodians are a very important part of the equation.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:19.400]   There are also what are called--there are facilitators, and then there are--oh, I'm drawing a blank here.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.400]   There are TPAs.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.400]   TPA stands for third-party administrator.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.400]   Yes, sorry, third-party administrator.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.400]   So there are custodians, administrators, and facilitators.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.400]   The custodians is the necessary piece of the puzzle.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:39.400]   Administrators are a group of firms, and there are quite a few out there,
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:44.400]   and they typically advertise the gold IRA or the real estate IRA or the checkbook LLC.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:47.400]   They have their marketing pieces.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:55.400]   But effectively what they do is they act as a middleman between the client and the custodian.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.400]   So what they'll do, they'll go find the custodian, usually a bank,
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:07.400]   and the bank will agree to custody assets, and the administrator will provide all the administrative services.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:12.400]   The custodian, or at least the larger custodians, do all of this.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.400]   You don't need an administrator for these custodians.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:23.400]   The TPA is effectively created--it's not a qualified custodian in the sense that some others are.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:28.400]   I'll give you, for instance, some of the larger self-directed IRA custodians are
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.400]   Pensco Trust Company, Equity Trust Company, Millennium Trust Company.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.400]   Those are some of the larger three.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.400]   There are some others, but those are kind of well-known.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.400]   What was the first one that you said? Because it broke up just a little bit.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:44.400]   So you said Equity Trust Company, Millennium Trust Company, and the first one was?
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   Pensco Trust Company.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:49.400]   Pensco. P-E-N-S-C-O?
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.400]   Yes.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.400]   Okay.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   And there's actually a lot of consolidation going on in the industry.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.400]   I know Pensco just acquired Lincoln Trust Company,
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   and a few years back, Equity Trust Company acquired Sterling Trust Company,
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:05.400]   and Sterling specialized in precious metals.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:11.400]   So there is some consolidation going on in the industry, but those are the major players.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:17.400]   I think that there are a number of things that people have to consider when they look at each,
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.400]   because there are a lot of components.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.400]   It's not just about the fee.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:28.400]   It's also about the service, about the expertise, and the customer service.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.400]   What I mean is they're prompt, and they get back to you, and they're knowledgeable.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.400]   I think that's important.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.400]   And then there's facilitators, which are kind of a hodgepodge.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   They don't really fit in the administrator or custodian bucket.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.400]   They're just people that work with self-directed IRAs,
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:49.400]   and I honestly couldn't give you an accurate definition of what they do.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.400]   I can just tell you that they exist.
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:59.400]   How's that for a ringing endorsement?
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.400]   I don't want to call anybody out, but it's just they exist, and they're not bad.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.400]   They're not good.
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:09.400]   They're there, and I couldn't accurately describe them.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.400]   But I think that the--so in setting up a self-directed IRA,
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.400]   the individual would go to one of these firms.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:18.400]   They would set up the IRA, and then they would work with that firm.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:23.400]   They'd find the asset, and that firm would work with them to purchase the asset,
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:26.400]   to manage it, and to sell it.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:29.400]   That's the simple way to do it.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:35.400]   There is a requirement, which--it's funny because there are a lot of IRA rules
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.400]   which apply to every single IRA, whether it's the self-directed type or not.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.400]   If you have a brokerage account, it's also required.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:49.400]   But because of the nature of a brokerage account, most of it is--you don't see the needs.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:55.400]   One is evaluation, which you're required to get an annual evaluation on all alternative assets.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.400]   So that is a requirement.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:02.400]   It could be a problem depending on the asset you're invested in.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.400]   For instance, some assets are easy, like a real estate investment is.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:13.400]   You can look at a broker's opinion or competitive market analysis.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:16.400]   You can look at a few different ways.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:22.400]   But there are some gray areas around the valuation that the IRS has not made entirely clear.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:34.400]   One is, what is required? Is it a qualified valuation or just a regular CPA's opinion?
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.400]   They haven't made it clear.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.400]   I know they kind of prefer it one way, but the case law is unclear.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.400]   So it's hard to say.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:46.400]   I think a lot of people have taken the stance of it's okay not to go through
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.400]   the really expensive qualified appraisal,
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:54.400]   as long as you're not going through any significant "events."
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:00.400]   Like if you're taking distributions or if you inherit the IRA or something,
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.400]   that might prompt a qualified appraisal.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:09.400]   But generally speaking, most assets I think you can get away without getting the true qualified.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:14.400]   But I don't want to give you that as advice because it's unclear.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.400]   Most people are not standing strong on that.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:23.400]   They're just kind of hoping for a direction from the IRS at this point.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.400]   So the valuation is important.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.400]   Like I said, some assets are harder to value than others.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.400]   But that's an important component.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.400]   But outside of that, that's pretty much it.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:41.400]   They should also find an attorney or accountant that is knowledgeable of this area.
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:47.400]   We find that most are aware of it, but they're not as knowledgeable as they should be.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:52.400]   And not because they're not smart people, but because it's not a common thing.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:55.400]   Unless the attorney or accountant specializes in this area,
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:59.400]   they're not going to have enough day-to-day experience to be up on all the rules
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:02.400]   and regulations and case law.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:08.400]   Because most people I talk to, they say, "Yeah, I had one person in 20 years ask me about it."
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.400]   So there's no reason for them to stay up to date.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:13.400]   But there are lists around that people can find,
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:20.400]   and custodians provide these lists of people that are qualified that do specialize in this area.
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:23.400]   So I think it's important to have one that understands this,
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:30.400]   because it is such a niche area that when it comes to tax preparation, like for instance,
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:36.400]   it is possible that you would have to file a tax return for your IRA.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:40.400]   And most people are not aware of that, but that could be a requirement,
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.400]   depending on what you're investing in.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:50.400]   Another reason to have a qualified accountant is it is possible you would have to pay taxes
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:55.400]   on the investment inside of your IRA.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:59.400]   Usually that comes down to if you're using leverage.
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.400]   The leverage portion is potentially taxable.
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:10.400]   So there are some subtleties that people have to understand, but in the IRA it's a lot simpler.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:16.400]   With a 401(k) it's more complicated, because you really should use a TPA.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:23.400]   You really should use a custodian that works with 401(k)s.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.400]   You have other components of the possible.
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:30.400]   If you're investing in precious metals, you have to find a depository.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:35.400]   You have to find a dealer to buy the coins or the metals from.
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:43.400]   So depending on the asset, there may be other components or vendors in the equation that have to be added.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:48.400]   But for IRAs it's generally a lot simpler.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:55.400]   Yeah, this is one of those areas where I think I would definitely--
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.400]   this is definitely as deep as I want to go on the show.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:03.400]   It's one of those things where I wanted to make people aware of some general input.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:06.400]   When we ran into each other at FinCon, I thought--
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:09.400]   and this has been great as far as just a good overview--
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.400]   but you need good advice here.
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.400]   Don't play games here.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.400]   And don't try to save a buck.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.400]   There's so much shady stuff on the internet.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:22.400]   I would get multiple--me personally--I would get multiple opinions,
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.400]   and I would want to work with people who specialize in this.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:29.400]   That's what I love about the world we live in in 2015 as compared to even--
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:32.400]   like you said, when you joined Paine-Weber in '99.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:40.400]   I mean, in '99, it seemed like it was so much more difficult to have a specialized presence.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.400]   You had to be all things to all people.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:47.400]   I mean, you probably started cold calling, and you're just talking the general to everybody else.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:52.400]   But now, with the ability to get your message out, and it takes time and it takes work,
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:58.400]   then people can specialize, and you can have specialty firms, specialty accountants,
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:04.400]   someone like you, a specialty advisor, a specialty fiduciary who can work.
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:09.400]   And the key is for the right clients to find the right providers.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.400]   But I would not try to save money if I were doing on this.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.400]   I wouldn't do it myself if I didn't have substantial--
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:19.400]   like, if you've got $5,000 in an IRA, don't waste your time.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:23.400]   Go and--I would say, go and make some money.
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:30.400]   Or you better have like 1,000%--1,000-fold potential investment, and you know it,
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.400]   and you're trying to do something.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:35.400]   But I would expect fees are high.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:40.400]   I would expect you need someone who's an expert, and make sure you pay for good advice.
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.400]   I mean, do you agree? Am I right?
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.400]   I would agree. I would definitely agree with that.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:51.400]   I mean, depending on the amount of assets, it could range between 1% and 3%
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.400]   for custodians if they're fee-based.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:00.400]   If you've got $5,000, the percentage is maybe upwards of 3%.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.400]   People look at that and say, "Wow, that's high," but it's not really.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.400]   Oh, that's nothing.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.400]   I can't imagine you would take--I wouldn't.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.400]   I mean, if I were in your business, there's not a chance in the world I'd take a $5,000 account,
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:15.400]   unless there were $5 million somewhere sitting there.
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.400]   It's just--I mean, we've got to be realistic here.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:24.400]   That's why I try to shoot straight on the show, and you've got to be realistic about--
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:27.400]   we're all in business. We've got to make money, and we've got to make money,
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:32.400]   and there's got to be a good fit between client and service provider.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:42.400]   And doing all the work and exposing yourself to the liability for $150, 3% of $5,000.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:46.400]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:54.400]   I mean, from our perspective, we're not looking for small clients.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.400]   Most advisors, their business is very scalable.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.400]   They buy one mutual fund over 200 clients.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.400]   It takes them five seconds.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.400]   They have to research it, but the process takes five seconds.
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.400]   If I were to buy one piece of real estate for one client, it could take us days.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.400]   We'd have to go to the registry, file the documents.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.400]   It's complicated.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:22.400]   So the way I look at it is, because we are really the only advisors doing this,
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:27.400]   if people call us or email us, I'll always point them in the right direction,
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.400]   if it's not a good fit.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:33.400]   From my perspective, everything has to be a personality fit.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.400]   Like, I won't work with jerks.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:41.400]   Somebody calls me up and they start treating me like a jerk right off the bat.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.400]   I say, "Sorry, it's not a good fit."
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:48.400]   But we come across a lot of people who have less than an optimal amount.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   I'll always just give them some general advice.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.400]   I'll say, "Look, here's how you should do it.
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:54.400]   Here's what you should do.
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:57.400]   You should probably get an accountant or attorney to help you with this
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:00.400]   because they'll at least give you some guidance."
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:07.400]   For the most part, it definitely needs to be a reasonable amount of money
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.400]   to make it worthwhile for us and for them.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.400]   It has to make sense.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:23.400]   I think that's--as you said before, it's something that is different.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:27.400]   It's worthwhile, but it doesn't fit every situation.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.400]   You shouldn't try to fit a square peg in a round hole.
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:38.400]   If somebody has $2,000 or $5,000 and they're not getting multiples return on something,
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.400]   then they should save up more and wait.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.400]   I'll be the bad guy for you, and I do want to give you a chance to plug your service
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:48.400]   and explain, kind of give your elevator pitch,
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.400]   and hopefully maybe you'll be a good fit for somebody in the listening audience.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.400]   You could be a resource for them.
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:57.400]   But I'll be the bad guy so you don't have to do it.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:01.400]   Two things. Number one is, remember, apply the lens of scale.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:05.400]   Like I talk about on the show constantly, if you've got $5,000 saved,
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:08.400]   there's not a chance in the world that, A, you should even have an IRA,
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:11.400]   unless it's a Roth IRA and that's just your emergency fund
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:18.400]   and you're just a super brilliant 16-year-old setting aside money in a Roth IRA from an early age.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:26.400]   The percentage of impact that you can make to try to invest in the difference between 10% in an index fund
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:34.400]   versus 35% rate of returns is absolutely meaningless when you have a count that's that small,
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:37.400]   at least in one or two or three years.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:44.400]   So a much better plan is focus on something where you can increase your income by $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.400]   and save that money so instead of $5,000 you have $105,000.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:53.400]   So don't spend your time trying to figure out how do I increase my percentage rate of return
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:56.400]   when that's not the best use of your time.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:01.400]   Number two, on amounts of money that small, you're far better turned,
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.400]   and I'm using it just simply as a metaphor,
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:08.400]   you're far better off spending time setting up the right business structure
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:13.400]   or taking the right deductions on starting something that's actually going to make you some money.
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:23.400]   Now over time you do transition to a point where an extra 2, 3, 4, 5, 20% return annually
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:26.400]   is going to make a massive difference, but focus on where you are
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:32.400]   and recognize that someday you'll be the big fish,
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.400]   but you've got to increase your income and build a business so that you have large amounts of money
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:40.400]   to where then you can use it in a creative way.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.400]   That would be my point one.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:45.400]   Thing two would be if you're interested in this kind of stuff,
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:50.400]   if you're the kind of person, if you're looking to do something shady,
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:51.400]   just simply don't.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:39:00.400]   Don't invite scrutiny in the most public of any investment you can make,
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.400]   which is going to be in one of these accounts.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:08.400]   So don't call Kirk and say, "Hey Kirk, I've got this shady deal."
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.400]   If you're looking to do something in a straightforward way and just simply use the laws that exist,
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.400]   then that would be, I would say, a good fit.
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:18.400]   So hopefully that will screen a few people if anyone can use your services.
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.400]   Kirk, plug, what you guys do, give us your elevator pitch of who you can serve effectively
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:28.400]   or at least the type of things that you're able to offer.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.400]   Okay, great.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:33.400]   I couldn't have said it better.
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:39.400]   I think the other point that you made is in understanding the rules,
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:41.400]   definitely do not try to break them.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:44.400]   You're not smarter than the IRS, believe me.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:50.400]   I've seen many cases, and what people have tried to do, just don't do it.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.400]   I wouldn't try to do it.
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.400]   I don't think anybody should because you will get caught,
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.400]   and it will be in a place that you will not be happy with.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:00.400]   So definitely don't do it.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:07.400]   So I guess in a transition to us, my firm, Innovative Advisor Group,
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.400]   we are an innovative wealth management firm,
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.400]   basically bridging the gap between traditional and nontraditional investments,
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:20.400]   although we've talked a lot about alternative investments on the show.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.400]   We also do a lot with traditional assets in an innovative way.
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.400]   Risk management is a cornerstone to what we do.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:33.400]   I think that's probably the most important thing that we tell people
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.400]   and our clients is risk management comes first.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.400]   Don't look at what returns you're going to get.
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.400]   Look at what you're going to lose.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.400]   And if you can deal with that, then the returns will take care of themselves.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:51.400]   So that is a very important point that anybody should consider with their investments.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:57.400]   So with our services, we provide financial planning services for our clients.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:02.400]   We manage assets for them, like I said, both traditional and alternative.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:09.400]   We specialize in self-directed IRAs and self-directed 401(k)s.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   We assist with the structuring.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:17.400]   We are not attorneys or accountants, but we do work with your attorney and accountants
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:22.400]   because in many cases they're not familiar with all of the necessities,
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:27.400]   and we will work with them to make sure that it's as it should be.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:35.400]   We can also act as a special advisor and custodians if you're not interested in having us
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:40.400]   necessarily manage the assets but would like us -- if you wanted to do a checkbook LLC
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:46.400]   and needed a special advisor, which is a requirement now, on that checkbook LLC,
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:50.400]   then we can assist in that fashion too.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.400]   And we also do strategic consulting, if you will.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.400]   So that's kind of more of a hodgepodge.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:02.400]   We do on special projects that people need an outside-the-box thinker to work on a strategy,
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:04.400]   whether it's self-directed or otherwise.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:10.400]   We have a varied set of background and interests, both my partner and I,
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:15.400]   so that I think is something we can offer too.
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:20.400]   You know, if you're interested in learning more about self-directed IRAs
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:25.400]   or any of the other subjects we discuss on the show, we have a website.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:28.400]   It's innovativewealth.com.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:30.400]   And we also have a blog.
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:34.400]   This is something we have once a week.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:36.400]   We have a post.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.400]   So we try to put as many resources on the site.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.400]   There's a number of things we're going to be putting up in the next month,
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:45.400]   which are also going to be valuable, like a list of IRA custodians,
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.400]   administrators, and facilitators.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.400]   We should have that up shortly.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.400]   And a few other things that I think people will benefit from.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:43:00.400]   One last point I'll mention is we have a new service called the Inflation Monitor on the blog.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:01.400]   It's free.
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:05.400]   But we created it to help measure inflation,
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:11.400]   and so people can accurately not just look at the CPI and say, "Oh, we have this amount of inflation,"
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:16.400]   but actually see the effects of inflation on the economy rather than just looking at a number,
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:19.400]   which some people think may not be necessarily accurate.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.400]   So that's a new service we've offered.
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:27.400]   We're tweaking it a little bit, but I think it's been very helpful to a lot of people.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.400]   So I want to check that out as well.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:34.400]   I'll make sure there's links to innovativewealth.com and to the blog in the show notes.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:39.400]   And then all your info is there, the contact info and everything is there.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:41.400]   Last question as you go.
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:46.400]   Any insight, comments, opinion on--I mean, it's been a year now,
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:50.400]   but since you're so involved in the self-directed IRA scenario,
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:56.400]   on the proposal last year and the president's budget proposal for the $3.4 million cap,
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:00.400]   do you have an opinion or comment on that issue?
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:06.400]   Well, you're certainly not going to get a politically correct answer on this.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:11.400]   You know, I think that getting back to the--and I think this was--some of this
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:19.400]   stemmed from the Romney IRA when people--there's been some subtle movements
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.400]   in the political background.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:27.400]   A, well, people have heard about it and they're upset, where the government wants to,
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:33.400]   let's just say, take people's retirement funds and give them treasuries instead,
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:38.400]   or they want to cap the amount you can have in an IRA, saying that you don't need more than that.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:44.400]   I think the day we start doing that is the day that--well, I shouldn't say the day that capitalism dies,
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.400]   because I think it's already slowly dying.
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:53.400]   But I think the reality is that if you're not incentivized to get whatever you want to get,
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:58.400]   if that's $100 million, great. If it's you want to own a new car, fine.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:04.400]   But if you're not allowed to do that, then you're really killing capitalism,
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.400]   because that's what drives people.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:12.400]   What drives people is the ability to do better, the people to be better, and to better society.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:21.400]   And I think if you don't allow people to do that, then you're really changing the dynamic.
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:31.400]   So having a cap on an IRA, looking at the numbers just from the GAO report,
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:37.400]   it should be fairly obvious that there are not a lot of people who fit that bill.
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:43.400]   I mean, over $3 million, you're talking about 36,000 people who have over $3 million in their IRA.
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:47.400]   These people didn't get there because they just got lucky.
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:52.400]   They got there because they did the right things, they invested right, they stayed,
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:58.400]   they took advantage of the tax code as it was. And I applaud them.
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.400]   I think they've done what they should have done.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.400]   There's plenty of people who are bad investors who lose money because they don't pay attention,
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.400]   don't know what they're doing.
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:16.400]   And I think that we shouldn't rain on the parade of the people who are successful,
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:20.400]   but rather try to bring the rest up to meet them.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:25.400]   Yeah, it's interesting, and certainly I don't disagree with you from how it should be.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:31.400]   This is a tough issue for me. I'm still pretty conservative, I'm not too worried about it.
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:37.400]   But I'll tell you what, and I've been open on the show, it's a research project of mine to try to figure things out.
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:41.400]   I've generally looked at it and said, there's not a chance of this stuff happening,
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:48.400]   because it's hard for me to imagine, you change the IRA rules, you start taxing IRAs,
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.400]   you start taxing 401ks, etc.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:55.400]   Even though there aren't that many people who have 10 million and up in them,
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:01.400]   but still they're so popular now, it's hard for me to imagine the population of the US
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:05.400]   not essentially rising up and demanding something different.
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:12.400]   But it's also hard to imagine how, facing the fiscal situation in this country,
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.400]   how something's not going to be required.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.400]   And what has bothered me is how little...
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:21.400]   Yes, it was only the President's budget proposal last year, and it didn't go anywhere.
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:29.400]   But just a couple days ago, with his proposals on changing 529s and covered out ESAs,
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:35.400]   what's bothering me is how little uproar I hear about that.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:39.400]   I just didn't hear much uproar, and maybe I'm not tuned in enough,
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:44.400]   but I'm a little concerned that if I didn't hear that much uproar, even at the mention of it,
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:47.400]   maybe my political analysis is wrong.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:53.400]   I'm watching it carefully, and it's an ongoing research project of mine to try to figure out...
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:58.400]   Here, try to predict politics. You're going to have good success with that, right?
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:01.400]   I think... I mean, think of it from another perspective.
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:06.400]   I mean, look when the individual income tax was instituted.
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:08.400]   It was only on wealthy people.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.400]   It was only on people making over a certain amount.
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:12.400]   And the only reason they got it passed was because they said,
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:15.400]   "Oh, it'll never be on everybody else. It'll only be on the wealthy."
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:21.400]   Well, eventually everybody got caught under that burden.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.400]   And it's how government works.
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:28.400]   They start with something that only affects the really rich people that nobody really cares about,
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:33.400]   and eventually politicians slowly work away at the foundation,
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:36.400]   and eventually it affects everybody.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:43.400]   And I think that is... the underlying theory of that is very dangerous.
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:50.400]   And that's why I think it's important for everybody to really stand against the fact that they try to do this.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:56.400]   However, as much as people hate Wall Street, one thing I will say,
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:03.400]   that if the government ever tried to take an IRA or 401(k) and confiscate it in the sense of,
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:06.400]   "Oh, we'll give you money and we'll do this for your retirement,"
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:11.400]   I guarantee you Wall Street has one of the strongest lobbying groups in existence.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:15.400]   That wouldn't fly, because think of all the assets they would lose.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:20.400]   All the money they would lose, that would never happen.
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:23.400]   That's a great argument. That is true.
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:27.400]   But I'll make the flip side, and we'll let it go as unresolved.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:30.400]   And it's one of those things that we'll just have to continue to watch
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:33.400]   and continue probably to argue among ourselves.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:37.400]   But looking at this Government Accountability Office report,
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:43.400]   the reason that Obama in his proposal last year picked that $3.4 million number,
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:53.400]   the GAO estimates that 36,171 total taxpayers have IRA balances in excess of $3 million.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.400]   Excuse me. Let me run this percentage.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:05.400]   So it's 36,171 plus 79,52 in excess of $5 million plus $791 in excess of...
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:07.400]   It's looking about 45,000 somewhere.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:11.400]   Right. Okay. Because I just realized these are exclusive bands. They're not cumulative.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.400]   There's 45,228 accounts with $3 million and over.
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:25.400]   If we divide that by 300 million people, that's .0001%.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:30.400]   So it's 1 with three zeros. Anyway, .0001%.
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.400]   And in today's world, I'm sorry, I just don't see...
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:38.400]   We have such a populist economic system where that is so easy to spin.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:42.400]   We're only affecting .0001% of the population.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.400]   This is the wealthiest .0001%.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:50.400]   And don't you know that the average retiree has $11,000 saved.
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:59.400]   So when it comes down to the politics of the 99% versus the 1%, I don't know. We'll see.
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:01.400]   I agree. But think of it this way.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:07.400]   How much would they be getting from that .0001%?
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:11.400]   That's not the point. I agree with you, but that's not the point.
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:14.400]   How much would they be getting?
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.400]   They waste more toilet paper than that.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:19.400]   No, you're right. But how much more would they be...
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:22.400]   Yeah, anyway. That's a long conversation.
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:27.400]   And I try to stay... I try to do the bare minimum of politics that matters on this show.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:31.400]   So, Kirk, this has been super fun. I think this is going to be one of the more popular interviews.
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:36.400]   And if you've got ideas, if you've got developments of things that are going on in this market,
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:37.400]   keep me in the loop.
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:41.400]   And if you've got things in the future that you think would be interesting,
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.400]   I'm sure my audience will really enjoy.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:45.400]   We'd love to hear from you again.
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:48.400]   So you're welcome back in the future.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:49.400]   Great. Well, thanks a lot, Joshua.
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:53.400]   I really appreciate you coming on the show and I had a lot of fun as well.
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:56.400]   Hope that information can be helpful to some of you.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:03.400]   For most of you, you probably should never think about investing in some of those other alternative investment classes.
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:08.400]   If you don't know anything about horses, just because you have money in an IRA doesn't mean that you should buy a horse.
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:13.400]   But for a few of you, the light bulb probably went off.
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:22.400]   And for those of you for whom it did, for those of you who can think of an intelligent way to leverage some unique knowledge and insight that you have,
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:25.400]   hopefully that can be a useful resource for you.
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:28.400]   Please feel free to check out Kirk's firm.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:31.400]   I can't give necessarily an endorsement.
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:35.400]   You can judge for yourself based upon how knowledgeable he seems from the interview.
[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:39.400]   I met him only one time. I haven't worked with him nor have I sent any clients to him nor have I heard.
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:41.400]   But you can judge for yourself.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:45.400]   He certainly seems to be a knowledgeable, knowledgeable gentleman.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.400]   And check him out, InnovativeWealth.com.
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:53.400]   Speak to him, speak to his partner, share with them your situation and maybe they can be of service to a few of you.
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:58.400]   I love exposing people who might be able to serve you and just make sure you do your homework.
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:01.400]   This is one of those areas where I would not go it alone.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.400]   I would make sure that I got some excellent advice.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:07.400]   As he pointed out, the penalties can be stiff for getting things wrong.
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:13.400]   And when you get into some of these more unique areas that aren't mainstream, it's not that things can't be done.
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.400]   It's just that they need to be done right.
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:17.400]   And you definitely, I think, want to work with an expert.
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:20.400]   So feel free. Give Kirk a call.
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:25.400]   And if any of you are able to work with him, give me some feedback personally just so I know.
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:28.400]   But he certainly seems to be very knowledgeable here.
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.400]   And Kirk, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:31.400]   I really do.
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:32.400]   I thank you.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:34.400]   I thank you for coming on.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.400]   Thank you so much for listening.

[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:54.400]   I'll talk to you next week about that as we get things launched.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:57.400]   I want to thank you to all of you who have joined and for your support.
