[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.760]   Our next guest is a good friend of mine,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.040]   previous business partner of mine,
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.040]   and somebody that I think one of the best things
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.040]   I can say about him is that in him there is no guile, okay?
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.520]   What I love about Leif Dahlin,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.320]   who is the founder of the Physician on Fire website,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.800]   blog, if you've seen that,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.520]   what I love about him is that he is so genuine.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.760]   He tells you what he is and what he wants,
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.680]   and you know him for years,
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.680]   and that's truly what he wants.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.420]   And it's very admirable in that he figured out
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.600]   what he wanted at a time when many of us
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.240]   aren't sure what we wanted,
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.640]   and actually retired from medicine at the age of 43, right?
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.160]   And has pursued the retired life since then.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.760]   So he's gonna be talking to us today
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.680]   about the decision to retire, number one,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.240]   and number two, creating a meaningful life after retirement,
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.940]   including an early retirement.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.060]   Leif, come on up.
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.900]   - We're good, we're good.
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.960]   All right, awesome, thank you, Jim.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.640]   Wonderful introduction.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.500]   It's definitely an honor to be here
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.160]   at the Bogleheads Conference speaking to you all.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.560]   I've wanted to come to one of these conferences for years.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.960]   I think I've been a lurker and an occasional contributor
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.460]   at Bogleheads for close to a decade,
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.280]   not two decades like Jim,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.760]   but for a pretty good long while.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.680]   And it's also an honor to be back home in Minnesota.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.560]   Like Jonathan, I'm a native Minnesotan.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.720]   I spent my first 26 years here,
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.080]   and I came back and finished up my anesthesia career
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080]   up in Brainerd, Minnesota.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.920]   And tonight, right after this talk, in fact,
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.140]   I'll be heading south to my high school reunion.
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.400]   It's 30 years, so you can do the math
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   and surmise that I'm 48.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.160]   And you might be wondering why I'm up here
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.960]   talking about retirement.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.760]   You know, 48-year-old kid compared to some of you.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.440]   But yeah, like Jim said, I retired
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.080]   not only once from anesthesia in 2019,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.080]   but again from the physician on fire online website,
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.120]   online business, about a year and a half ago
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.720]   when I sold it to a couple of physicians.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.200]   So deciding to retire is something
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.160]   that I have done two times now.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.700]   It's something that I contemplated
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.760]   and considered quite a lot.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.620]   And so I'm gonna spend about 30 minutes
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.640]   on these two topics, which doesn't give us a lot of time,
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.480]   but I still want to have a little bit of fun
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.800]   with you all before we get started.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.680]   And so I want to quickly, as a native Minnesotan,
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.760]   teach you how to speak Minnesotan, okay?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.960]   So this is going to be a repeat-after-me exercise,
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.480]   and I want you to focus not only on the words,
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.460]   but on the pronunciation, okay?
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.120]   So, I want to hear you repeat after me.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.220]   Go gophers.
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.980]   Row the boat.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.100]   Yeah, sure, you betcha.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.360]   Oof-da.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.720]   All right, very good.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.700]   You're all honorary Minnesotans.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.520]   Give yourself a hand.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.680]   (audience applauding)
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.380]   All right, so it would be remiss to talk about retirement
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.620]   without mentioning the money part.
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.820]   Now, other speakers here can talk circles around me
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.700]   on the withdrawal rates, variable withdrawal rates,
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.140]   but I like to refer back to the 4% rule as a rule of thumb.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.740]   Maybe you like 3.5%.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.380]   Maybe you are willing to take a little more risk
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.180]   and go with 4%, but the gist of it is to know
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.180]   that you have saved up about 25 times the money you need
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.300]   to make up for any shortfall in income that you might have
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.380]   to cover your expenses in retirement.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.220]   And I think the difficult thing
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.900]   that maybe isn't discussed as much
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.000]   when we're talking about percentages
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.540]   and finite dollar amounts is how much variation
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.500]   there's going to be, not only from year to year,
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.180]   but also the difference between before you retire
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.600]   and after you retire.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.180]   The difference between having younger kids
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.460]   and teenagers or adult kids, et cetera.
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.540]   So your expenses can be all over the place.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.580]   And obviously you want to account
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.620]   for things like social security.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.540]   If you're fortunate enough to have a pension
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.520]   and, well, health insurance, healthcare coverage,
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.100]   that's something that many of us have provided
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.180]   by our employers, but when you retire,
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.300]   you may have to purchase by yourself for the first time.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.940]   You know, in my budget that I created five years ago,
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.600]   not really a budget, but it was more for a blog post.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.100]   I just wrote up, like, here's what 80 grand would buy,
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.760]   and I think that would be a decent retirement spending
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.120]   amount for myself.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.060]   Now, that was five years ago.
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.220]   That might be 100 grand now,
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.780]   and that's probably about where we're at.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.980]   But 20 grand of that was healthcare,
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.140]   and my premium is now a loan of about 15 grand,
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.260]   and that's for a bronze HSA plan,
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.980]   which is not top of the line by any means.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.180]   So there are going to be new expenses.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.020]   You're going to have some expenses that go away.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.340]   You may not have to commute anymore.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.240]   That can be a significant expense,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.700]   not to mention a source of stress.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.820]   Professional attire, if you have a job
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.460]   where you wear a suit and tie often,
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.160]   well, you won't have to buy too many more of those,
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.020]   unless you go to speak at Bogleheads.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.220]   But this is a tie that I probably picked up
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.420]   at a garage sale.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.100]   It says Metrodome, Minnesota.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.740]   You may know the Metrodome collapsed
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.060]   in a very Minnesotan way
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.740]   by being weighed down by too much snow,
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.960]   so they replaced it with US Bank Stadium,
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.300]   which is a great place,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.020]   and I was there on Sunday for the Vikings victory.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.060]   Go Vikes.
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.700]   All right.
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.940]   Other things that change.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.860]   When I retired from anesthesia,
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.780]   I started traveling with my family,
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.820]   and the goal was to spend six to eight months traveling,
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.120]   four to six months home in northern Michigan.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.100]   That didn't work out once that virus
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.780]   started circulating around,
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.820]   right around the time of Jim's WC icon in Las Vegas,
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.300]   but we did get to travel quite a lot,
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.700]   and when you maintain a home at home,
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.900]   and are traveling, of course, your expenses are higher.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.580]   And then the quote-unquote one-time expenses,
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.740]   well, they don't just happen one time,
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.060]   they happen once or twice a year, I've found,
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.180]   and I think that you need to factor in those things.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.080]   So tracking your expenses for a year is a good idea,
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.540]   but it is just a starting point.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.380]   All right.
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.020]   One more year syndrome, right?
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.900]   Anyone suffer from this in the past or presently?
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.740]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.580]   So it's the idea that, well, I think I have enough,
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.380]   but if I were just to work one more year,
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.920]   and let's say I can set aside 100 grand,
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.820]   that's $4,000 a year for life, that's a lot of money, right?
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.060]   Make, you know, set aside twice as much,
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.380]   working maybe a few years,
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.140]   or having a really good job that pays really well,
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.340]   well, that's $8,000 a year for life, right?
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.260]   So you could buy season tickets,
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.220]   maybe it's an extra vacation,
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.100]   first class for most if not all of your flights,
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.140]   maybe just a really nice bicycle, you know?
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.140]   And I did work one more year, four or five times,
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.580]   but, you know, it worked out.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.780]   I do have season tickets to the Gophers,
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.980]   even though I live in Michigan.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.060]   It's a 10-hour drive,
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.740]   but I usually come over for a week or two every fall,
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.740]   get in a couple, maybe three games,
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.740]   and, you know, for me, it was worth it.
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.220]   You know, the counterpoint to this is that
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.780]   when you determine how much you wanna spend,
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.500]   it should include things like the really nice bicycle,
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.740]   the first class flights, if that's what you want,
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.820]   your season tickets, et cetera.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:58.100]   And in terms of having money,
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.780]   you know, with the safe withdrawal rates,
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.900]   we often focus on a dollar figure,
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.940]   but there is an asset location component
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.580]   that is very important because we all know
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.940]   that $3 million in an IRA is different than 3 million
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.060]   in a Roth IRA is different than a combination
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.740]   of 2 million in a 401(k) with a million in taxable.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.780]   And so I like to break it down and think of it
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.500]   in terms of different epochs or timeframes
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.460]   in which you will be potentially spending money
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.100]   as a retiree.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.980]   Before age 59 and a half,
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.260]   that's when you have somewhat more limited access
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.140]   to your retirement funds, of course.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.100]   A taxable brokerage account, non-qualified account,
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.060]   well, that is really easy to take money from
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.020]   when you want to at any age.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.100]   There are tax implications, of course.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.900]   Passive income, in big, fat quotations.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.220]   That's, you know, rental income from rental properties
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.740]   you own, might be small business.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.660]   There are some not-so-passive passive incomes.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.460]   There is truly passive income,
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.980]   like dividends from your Vanguard account.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.820]   But that will all come to you at any age.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.780]   SEPP, I feel like that should be a repeat after me.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.180]   Say substantially equal periodic payments.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.500]   Yeah, it's tough.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.380]   Yeah, but that's Rule 72(t)
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.700]   that allows you to set up withdrawals
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.340]   from tax-deferred account, like an IRA,
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.820]   and get equal amounts every year
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.980]   until you do reach the age of 59 1/2.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.740]   There are rules, and it's kind of like the RMD rules,
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.700]   where if you screw up and take too much or too little,
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.420]   it could be problematic, and the fines can be quite severe.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.420]   But it is a kind of a neat way to access your IRA early.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.220]   Roth ladder is not a favorite technique of mine,
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.340]   but it is a way, if all of your money is tax-deferred
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.300]   and you don't have a lot of other places
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.020]   to draw income from, if you start five years in advance,
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.940]   start converting your money to a Roth IRA from tax-deferred.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.020]   Five years later, that money has seasoned,
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.020]   and the amount that was converted can be withdrawn
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.940]   and used to fund your retirement.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.100]   So it's a ladder, just like a bond ladder,
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.140]   where you do it each year, and then starting in year five,
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.980]   you have rolling ability to take out the amount converted.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.820]   I don't like to take money out of a Roth IRA
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.580]   because it's very valuable money.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.940]   It will grow tax-free.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.260]   But if you are in a situation
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.500]   where almost all of your funds are tax-deferred,
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.820]   it can be useful.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.060]   The next epoch is age 59 1/2,
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.060]   to the age at which you can take RMDs.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.060]   Currently, that's around 72, 73.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.380]   This is also the epoch in which you will decide
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.140]   when to take Social Security.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.740]   That's an entire 'nother talk.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.540]   But in general, if you are in good health
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.220]   and you have longevity on your side,
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.940]   it is usually a pretty good idea
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.740]   to delay as long as you can, perhaps to age 70.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.220]   Mike Piper right there is an expert on that.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.900]   He has a great calculator online
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.700]   that can help you determine when you,
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.260]   and if you have one, your spouse,
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.060]   should take Social Security.
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.060]   Once you reach RMD age,
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.780]   there may be a role for QCDs.
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.420]   That was mentioned earlier.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.740]   And I didn't mention that Roth conversions.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.900]   So RMDs, obviously the Required Minimum Distribution,
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.340]   they can get to be problematic
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.700]   in a way that they might push you into a tax bracket
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.020]   you don't want to be in,
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.700]   and you might be receiving more money
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.940]   than you plan to spend.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.860]   And so what's great about the Qualified Charitable Distribution
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.940]   is that it effectively acts
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.660]   as an above-the-line tax deduction.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.900]   So you take money from your 401(k), IRA,
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.180]   give it directly to charity.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.260]   It does not pass through you.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.180]   It does not go on to your 1040.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.740]   And so it effectively lowers your AGI or MAGI,
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.980]   which is used to determine things like IRMA,
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.140]   the income, yeah.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.220]   Again, this is the 501 track, right?
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:18.020]   Yeah, monthly adjustment amount.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.780]   But anyway, so it's a really useful way
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.100]   to satisfy a portion of your RMD,
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.860]   up to $100,000 per year per person.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.500]   So if you're married, you could do $200,000
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.900]   between the two of you and be charitable
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.860]   if that is what you are inclined to be.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.180]   Speaking of charitable,
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.340]   I've done a little bit of charity work.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.060]   This is my younger son and I in the operating room
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.220]   at a small facility in Honduras.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.980]   And it was really cool to let him see what I do for a living.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.060]   Now, in this picture, you can't tell,
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.020]   but the monitor is blank.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.500]   There's no patient hooked up,
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.020]   so we're not goofing around during surgery.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.540]   But he did get to see a little bit
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.940]   of what it's like to be in there
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.260]   and what I do or what I did for a living.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.300]   And of course, I had to decide if I would be okay
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.260]   just not doing that anymore
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.380]   because, of course, I was a doctor.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.540]   It was a part of my identity.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.740]   And I think for some people and for some other people,
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.900]   it's an even larger part of the identity
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.900]   so when you decide to retire,
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.340]   know that you're leaving behind that identity.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.140]   You're leaving behind a purpose.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.460]   And I made that two words, on purpose,
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.980]   because hopefully work isn't your sole purpose.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.940]   But it may be a primary one
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.460]   and replacing it can be challenging.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.940]   Social life, a lot of people have a lot of work friends,
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.380]   a lot of close friends at work,
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.660]   satisfy, and maybe don't even realize it,
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.660]   but a lot of their needs of having connections
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.060]   and relationships through work.
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.100]   And that disappears really quickly when you leave,
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.860]   especially if you move away from where you were working
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.940]   as I did when we went back to Michigan
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.780]   where my wife's family was.
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.260]   All right, so you're leaving behind a paycheck.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.780]   Now we've already said you got the money part figured out,
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.180]   you saved enough money, but there is a psychological aspect
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.180]   of behavioral finance piece of not having regular cash flow
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:27.420]   and not having extra so you can hit buy on VTSAX
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.740]   instead of sell.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.500]   And so making that transition can be painful.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.820]   Leaving behind an alarm clock, not painful.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.820]   Love it, love it.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.340]   I'm a sleep enthusiast and I enjoy the fact that,
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.580]   well, I mean, we have kids going to school,
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.740]   we do use the alarm clock maybe more
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.740]   than I thought I would.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.100]   But not having it, especially for a few years
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.700]   where my kids were not going to school,
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.860]   well, it was wonderful.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.620]   Commuting, obviously, if you are someone
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.020]   who actually goes to work, when you go to work,
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.740]   you can stop doing that.
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.540]   And jobs can be stressful, the commute itself,
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.660]   and you can leave that all behind.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.520]   You also gain some things when you retire.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.020]   We gain time freedom, right?
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.420]   You might have 40 hours a week that you get to replace
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.300]   with whatever you want to do.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.420]   I found that location independence was key for me.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.220]   When I left my anesthesia job,
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.540]   took that opportunity to take our kids out of school
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.020]   and we timed it so that they would be finishing
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.700]   grade school, maybe skip part of junior high.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.820]   And so for four years, we did all that traveling.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.700]   And we were able to kind of recreate a honeymoon photo
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.620]   with this sign in Talkeetna, Alaska.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.660]   I know a place that Jim Dolley has been to a number of times
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.460]   when he was a tour guide on the train that we took up there.
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.260]   And the ability to be wherever you want,
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.660]   whenever you want is amazing.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.940]   Now our kids are back in high school,
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.100]   so we've lost some of that.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.020]   My older son is, my younger son is in eighth grade,
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.540]   so he'll be in high school next year.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.740]   You gain other people's envy, right?
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.420]   And that's not such a good thing, you know,
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.020]   when someone says, "Must be nice."
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.580]   Not a compliment.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.900]   I don't know if this will give gold watches.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.980]   I like my Garmin, so I'm good with this.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.100]   But to summarize this first part of our two-part talk,
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.100]   figure out the money part,
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.540]   make sure you've got enough money.
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.260]   Have a withdrawal strategy
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.180]   that is based upon your asset location.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.860]   Think about tax optimization,
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.940]   because that is a huge component
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.180]   of the most optimal withdrawal strategy.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.540]   Make sure you've got healthcare figured out.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.220]   It's expensive.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.060]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.660]   Not really my fault, but I was part of that.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.060]   Make sure you're okay mentally, physically, psychologically,
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.940]   without working a job.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.100]   That can be something that, well, people fail,
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.180]   they fail retirement
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.700]   because they don't think about that beforehand,
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.660]   and then they just don't know what to do
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.940]   with their newfound free time.
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.860]   So have plans for the free time.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.660]   We went to Peru, the four of us, that's my family there,
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.820]   dune buggy riding at a place called Huacachina,
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.820]   which is a desert oasis just outside of Ica, Peru.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:17.780]   Of course, we went to Machu Picchu
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.180]   and a bunch of other places.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.020]   Awesome time.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.580]   As you can tell, I love my freedom.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.460]   I am bragging a little bit, not gonna lie.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.020]   It's been good.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:27.980]   Optimal timing.
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.180]   Timing for us was based upon a couple of things.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.220]   My kid's age, also my replacement,
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.380]   he finished residency at the end of June,
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.020]   and wanted to start work in August,
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.620]   so I worked until about mid-August,
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.140]   so I was able to help train him in.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.540]   I also timed the year to the time
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.260]   where he would be able to join us,
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.380]   because he actually interviewed two and a half years
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.260]   before he was done with his anesthesia residency,
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.860]   so I knew long in advance when I'd be retiring.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.140]   Another factor might be the time of year.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.500]   You might wanna make sure you have enough time
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.580]   to max out a 401(k) or a 403(b),
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.460]   enough time to max out a 457(b), HSA,
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.700]   whatever it might be,
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.140]   and so that might mean working into March, April, May, June.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.780]   Maybe you want to retire
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.140]   right when summer vacation starts if you have children.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.620]   You obviously are going to confer with your spouse,
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.020]   and it may not make a ton of sense
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.020]   to not work if your spouse is working,
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.220]   so lots to think about there.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.220]   So that's part one.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.940]   We'll jump to part two.
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.460]   Still working on this one,
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.980]   but creating a meaningful life after retirement.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.060]   That is my mother and father.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.380]   My dad, 53 years ago,
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.860]   enlisted in the Army right out of dental school
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.500]   because he knew that he might have a little more control
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.540]   over what happens to him in Vietnam
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:57.540]   if he is going as a volunteer rather than as a draftee,
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.740]   and he went over for a tour of duty in a med-dent unit,
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.500]   was there nearly a year,
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.020]   and obviously, Vietnam has changed a lot
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.540]   in the last 50 years,
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.060]   and it's become a place that tourists go,
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.500]   and my dad really wanted to return
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.420]   and see what that was looking like.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.580]   It would be meaningful for him,
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.380]   and we actually had plans to go in 2020.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.380]   We didn't go in 2020,
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.340]   but last year, I saw a really good airfare,
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.180]   and I sent it to him,
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.700]   and I said, "You should go.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.980]   "It's like 800 bucks round trip,"
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.180]   and he said, "Oh, can you come with?"
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.940]   And I said, "Well, no, we got the kids in school.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.780]   "We can't just, you hop over to Vietnam
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.220]   "for two or three weeks."
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.940]   They said, "No, can you go?"
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.660]   "Oh, I never thought about traveling without my family,
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.780]   "but you are my family, aren't you?
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.700]   "Okay."
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.660]   So we went to Vietnam,
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.540]   traveled around for two, two and a half weeks,
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.940]   and it was wonderful,
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.300]   and it was meaningful for him, for me,
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.220]   to be able to spend that time with them,
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.740]   and yeah, so that's just one of those things,
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.580]   that time freedom, the location independence,
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.260]   an understanding wife who lets you go
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.020]   to one of her dream spots without her, all very key.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.140]   This is a poem.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.380]   I hope you can see it.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.580]   It's a portion of a poem,
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.580]   and I found this through a letter from T. Boone Pickens,
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.220]   a billionaire who passed away fairly recently,
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:27.220]   and he shared this in a letter that is online
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.300]   at, I think it's Oklahoma State.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.860]   He was a big benefactor to them,
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.060]   and I won't read the whole thing
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.940]   'cause I get choked up when I do,
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.380]   but hopefully you can see it.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.140]   Go ahead and read it.
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:46.460]   But the gist is that while you're here,
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.420]   you make an impact, you affect people.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.140]   He says, "Put your hand in the water.
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.100]   "When you're gone, pull the hand out of the water.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.860]   "What's left is what's left,
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.700]   "and what's left is still water," right?
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.700]   So I take away that you should make a splash
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.100]   while you can, impact people while you're here,
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.020]   and realize that when you're gone,
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.460]   life goes on without you.
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.140]   Sticking with a bit of a somber tone,
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.820]   part of our kids' four years
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.060]   of what we called world schooling was education,
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.740]   and you can't really see them in the lower right,
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.540]   and that's my wife and two kids.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.220]   I'm taking the picture,
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.260]   but this is the Plaschow concentration camp.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:41.180]   We also visited Auschwitz, the Anne Frank House,
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.060]   Holocaust Museum in D.C.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:50.620]   to help just understand the past,
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.660]   and that's what meaning is, right?
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.940]   It's understanding the past about others,
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.180]   but also about yourself.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.140]   You know, it's defined by what you've done
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.580]   and where you've been,
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.700]   and purpose is more about who you are
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.260]   and what you're doing now,
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.460]   and what your plans are for the future,
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.020]   and of course, what matters?
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.780]   Well, you know, it's up to you.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.020]   You get to define that.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.860]   You know, one thing that I've found
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.940]   that's really helpful in retirement
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.900]   is to focus a bit on self-improvement,
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.380]   and when I say that, it conjures up images,
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.660]   I think of like self-help books and gurus
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.340]   and Tony Robbins up here with, you know,
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.900]   seven feet tall and the white teeth,
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.020]   but I don't think you need any of that.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.780]   I think to me, self-improvement is just focusing
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.580]   on your physical health, your mental health.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.700]   I did a tough mudder race,
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.540]   dislocated my shoulder three times.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.820]   By the end, it was just kind of dragging behind me,
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.020]   so that was more like self-injury and self-harm,
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.060]   but not intentional.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.860]   But now I'm training for a marathon.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.980]   I'll be running the Twin Cities next Sunday,
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.820]   so pray for cool weather for me and clouds.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:09.620]   And my roommate here, Jordan, can attest, Jordan Grumet,
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.900]   he's the one that taught me about meaning and purpose.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.300]   I meant to say that on the last slide,
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.700]   but I had a hard time getting through it.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.060]   You know, he can attest to the fact
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.660]   that I woke up and did my push-ups and sit-ups and squats
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.740]   and do a lingo Spanish lesson.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.180]   It's something I do every day.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.300]   I consider that to be self-improvement.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.660]   Strength in relationships, all right?
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.340]   I went to that Gophers game last weekend,
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.940]   Blue Hawks, with a med school classmate.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.740]   Went to a Twins game the other day with a college friend.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.180]   Gonna see a bunch of high school friends tonight.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.700]   Relationships are very important,
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.700]   and there are reasons beyond just having a good time.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.580]   The American Heart Association published a study
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.700]   showing that if you suffer from social isolation,
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.220]   if you are alone, you have a 28% risk
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:05.220]   of cardiovascular disease, 32% increased risk of a stroke.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.820]   And, you know, it maybe doesn't impact your lungs as much,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.500]   but in some ways, it's almost as bad as smoking, all right?
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.580]   So you want to have friends.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.100]   You want to have people you can confide in
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.980]   that you trust, that trust you, that you're close to.
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.100]   The Harvard Study of Adult Development,
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.540]   it's been going on for 85 plus years.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.500]   They've found that relationships
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.940]   are the most important factor for happiness.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.820]   It's not money.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.380]   So we're here to talk, you know, primarily about money,
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.340]   but it's the people that you know, that know you,
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.180]   and the relationships you have with them
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.280]   that are really the ultimate key
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.180]   to living longer, being happier,
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.220]   and it's important to cultivate those relationships
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.180]   and maintain them.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.980]   So finding meaning in retirement,
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.260]   it's about how you spend your time too, right?
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.180]   When I moved to Brainerd,
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.100]   I was asked to join a curling club
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.420]   and I had seen it in the Olympics,
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.580]   but I had never done it before,
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.260]   but I said, sure, that sounds like fun
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.140]   because that's how I'm going to meet people.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.100]   I'll be part of a different community.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.700]   You know, like the Bogleheads here, this is a community.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.540]   Right?
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.740]   It's something that I can do with my kids.
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.380]   There they are, once again,
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.180]   they are prominently featured today.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.460]   And again, you're picking up new skills, new achievements.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.900]   Volunteering is a great way to find purpose in retirement.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.900]   And we're getting, yeah, we're getting towards the end here.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.580]   Also understand that there will be
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.780]   questions that go unanswered, right?
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.780]   Meaning is up to you to define.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.640]   Choosing your purpose, it's something that,
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.020]   well, you know, you make plans and God laughs, right?
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.580]   So I try not to make plans more than about
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.300]   three to five years in advance.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.060]   And those are just tentative plans
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.360]   because I know that the circumstances will change.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.220]   How I want to live my life may change.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.060]   You don't know how much time you're going to have.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.180]   And so again, referring back to that poem,
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:12.200]   make a splash while you have that opportunity.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.180]   And you know, you may choose to work again
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.860]   when you retire at 43 or 47, you know?
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.660]   I mean, maybe there's a third act.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.380]   I don't know for myself.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.940]   And if you are contemplating retirement,
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.460]   understand that it may be temporary.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.000]   I don't know yet what it will look like
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.060]   to have an empty nest.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:36.060]   On one hand, I am excited for the return of, you know,
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.500]   freedom and freedom to be where we want to be
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.300]   when we want to be there.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.340]   But on the other hand, I know I will miss the kids
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.860]   and it'll be an interesting transition
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.980]   that I can try to predict, but won't know.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.920]   So that is what I had for you today.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.780]   Thank you all for your attention.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.020]   And I've got a question.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:57.900]   Wow, that was quick.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.300]   (audience applauding)
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.660]   Ah, all right.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.860]   Even better than a question,
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.540]   it is a definition of happiness.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.380]   Thank you.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.720]   Oh, Lady Geek, wonderful.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.780]   Good to meet you.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:14.620]   Sue.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.440]   All right.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.980]   Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.540]   is to give life purpose and meaning.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.060]   That's a head spinner, but I like it.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.100]   Thank you, Lady Geek.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:30.620]   I think we don't have any other questions.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.900]   Am I correct, right?
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.900]   Question collectors?
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.900]   Okay, let's give Leif a great big round of applause.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.900]   (audience applauding)
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.740]   Thank you.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.580]   Thank you, thank you.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.400]   Thank you so much.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.240]   Thank you, Jim.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.080]   Thank you.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:53.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
