[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.880]   All right.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.520]   Our first question comes from Sufian,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.120]   who says, is your new online course applicable for someone
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.080]   with ADHD?
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.200]   That's a good question.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.000]   I mean, I have two courses, so I don't know
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.080]   which one you're talking about.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.520]   Longtime readers of mine and listeners of the show
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.680]   more recently know that one of the areas I explore
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.840]   is alternative forms of pedagogy.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.800]   So when it comes to the type of things
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.960]   I write about or podcast about, I
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.240]   did a lot of book writing, article writing.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.320]   Obviously, I'm messing with audio and video
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.840]   as a way of delivering information.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.120]   And another thing I have an ongoing experiment with
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.840]   is really focused online, high-end online courses
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.480]   as yet another channel through which
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.800]   you can deliver information.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.360]   I mean, I'm very interested in innovation in this space.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.960]   So I have a longtime working relationship
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.360]   with my longtime friend Scott Young, who actually
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.080]   has a whole company that does nothing
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.400]   but produce online courses.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.520]   It's technically incredibly demanding.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.560]   You have to have a support staff, an IT staff.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.760]   It's not for the faint of heart.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.160]   So he has this great company that does it.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.680]   And we've collaborated on two courses.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.640]   One, which was the first one, was called Top Performer.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.280]   The course we did before I even wrote Deep Work,
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.000]   and it was about applying deliberate practice,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.800]   the concepts of deliberate practice to your career.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.600]   And we re-released that this year, I guess,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.120]   or last year.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.720]   Recently, we did a second version, like a 2.0 version,
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.760]   where we went back to the studio and we filmed new mini courses
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.440]   and new lessons.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.840]   And we sort of upgraded the course
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.720]   because it had been around for a while.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.840]   We've had 5,000 students go through that course.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.920]   We learned a lot.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.760]   So that might be what you're talking about.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.000]   But then the first fall of the pandemic,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.760]   we launched our second online course,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760]   which was called Life of Focus.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.120]   And that has three modules to it.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.280]   But it integrates ideas from digital minimalism, ideas
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.840]   from deep work, and ideas from Scott's book, Ultra Learning.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.240]   So there's something in there about learning things really
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.520]   quick.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.080]   There's something about being better at deep work
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.960]   and something else about the deep life more generally.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.300]   So I don't know if you're talking
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.640]   about a Life of Focus or Top Performer 2.0.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.320]   Either of those courses, I don't think
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.200]   ADHD is an obstacle.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.360]   I mean, it gives clarity on here's
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.600]   what you should be working on.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.880]   Here's what happens next.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.560]   But then gives you, obviously, freedom
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.880]   to figure out when and how you execute that work.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.960]   So I think whatever strategies you already
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.160]   use for organizing and scheduling your attention
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.480]   and time can be applied here.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.760]   These courses are going to give you plenty of flexibility for,
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.400]   here's what you're working on this week
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   for the next couple of weeks.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.520]   But you can figure out how you want to get it done.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.840]   Now, there's difference in the delivery.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.400]   So Life of Focus has a method where
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.200]   you're working on one project for a month.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.000]   So each of the modules has a month dedicated to a project.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.160]   But then you get these quicker updates
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.840]   throughout the week that give you extra information
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.520]   and give you tips and support for the project
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.360]   you're working on.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.020]   So that might actually be good if you're
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.400]   worried about your attention wandering away
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.000]   from the project.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.520]   You get these quick updates to help
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.680]   keep you on track for working on a longer project.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   Now, from a timing perspective, we launched--
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.000]   Top Performer 2.0 was open earlier.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.160]   And I'm not sure.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.200]   It might be a little while until it's open again.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.120]   Life of Focus, we're going to open that soon.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.280]   I don't have the exact date.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.120]   But I think we're opening that back up again
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.360]   for a new class at the end of January, early February.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.740]   So stay tuned for that.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.120]   If you're interested in learning about when these courses open
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.960]   up or whatever, at calnewport.com/blog.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.360]   So on the website for my blog, on the sidebar there,
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   I believe there's a link for both courses.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.400]   If you click on it, there's a place
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.120]   you can put in an email address for the waiting list.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.320]   And then Scott will just send a note when, hey, by the way,
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.520]   the course is opening again.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.240]   I think sometimes also we do waiting list
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.760]   version of the courses where the people who
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.600]   are on the waiting list will say, if you're interested,
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.400]   we're going to launch a special version just for you.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.440]   So anyways, check that out.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.280]   Sign up for those waiting lists if you're interested.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   These are great courses.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.760]   It's been a really cool experiment.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.080]   We've had thousands of people take these.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.680]   I think it's the future of what we do in pragmatic nonfiction.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.720]   But sign up for those lists at calnewport.com/blog
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.280]   if you want to be kept up to speed.
