[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.240]   -Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.760]   Duncan, it feels like a strange day to talk about the
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.480]   markets with everything going on in Ukraine.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.320]   We actually had a viewer, one of our podcast listeners,
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.880]   emailed us this week and was asking about the
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.200]   markets and some of the stuff we were saying.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.880]   And he said he was from Ukraine.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.400]   And I wrote him back saying, thanks for asking about the
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.680]   markets, but what's going on in the general mood of the
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.040]   people there?
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.480]   I can't even begin to imagine what it's
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.560]   like there right now.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.760]   I guess this is a good reminder to count yourself
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.860]   lucky if your biggest worry right now is your portfolio.
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.840]   These are temporary problems.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.640]   I guess it's also a good reminder that so much of what
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.440]   goes on in the markets and in the economy just is completely
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.840]   outside of your control.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.800]   So as an investor, you have no control over geopolitics and
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.960]   the actions of politicians.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.200]   You have no control over monetary
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.480]   policy or fiscal policy.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.560]   You have no control over what happens in the economy.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.400]   You have no control over the level or direction of interest
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.680]   rates, the stock market, inflation, all this stuff.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.720]   It's all completely out of your control.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.680]   There's just nothing you can do about it.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.680]   So the only thing that really matters at a time like this is
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.240]   focusing on what you can control.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.480]   So if you think about your finances, your savings rate,
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.200]   and your asset allocation, and the fees you pay, and your
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.800]   investment plan, and your long-term goals, and maybe the
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.120]   most important thing right now is how you react to violent
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.480]   moves in the market.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.080]   It's not necessarily the actions of the
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.160]   markets that matter.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.640]   It's like for your ultimate success or failure as an
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.640]   investor, it's like your reactions.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.200]   How you handle yourselves when markets are moving violently
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.080]   in the world is seemingly going mad.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.560]   So this is kind of a good time to slow down, not make any
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.600]   rash decisions.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.680]   It's obviously scary and uncertain.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.680]   People cope in different ways when this stuff happens.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.600]   There are people who tell you they know exactly what's going
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.680]   to happen next.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.680]   My default for something like this is just not
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.480]   trying to be a hero.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.880]   Don't make it worse by trying to make a huge mistake at the
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.480]   wrong time.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.800]   So we're still going to talk about finance stuff today,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.400]   because maybe that's how I personally cope with this
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.880]   stuff.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.040]   Markets aren't the most important thing right now, but
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.440]   it doesn't mean we can't ignore them.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.720]   So I don't know if you stick around to the end of the show.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.280]   Duncan, we're going to give some stuff away to people,
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.760]   free stuff.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.480]   What do we got?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.680]   I don't think anyone's feeling as celebratory as we were on
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.680]   Tuesday for What Are Your Thoughts.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.600]   But yeah, we said we were going to do a giveaway today.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.920]   So we're still going to give away a shirt, a coffee mug,
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.360]   and a sticker.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.480]   So yeah, make sure you hang out till the end.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.680]   And we're going to do the same thing we did for What Are Your
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.280]   Thoughts, where we'll use the hashtag 100, lowercase k,
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.840]   hashtag 100k.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.960]   And yeah, we'll do a drawing.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.240]   So stick around for that.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.520]   And yeah, I think what you just said is great, Ben.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.840]   But yeah, obviously, more important stuff going on.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.080]   But I think for a lot of people, this kind of thing is
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.520]   giving a sense of normalcy, hopefully a calm voice of
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.680]   reason, and kind of all this craziness.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.400]   So yeah, that's why we're here today.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.720]   So hopefully everyone gets something out of it.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.920]   All right, let's do a question.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.720]   OK.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.280]   So question one is, the SMPU returned 18% in 2020 after a
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.480]   chaotic year.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.760]   In 2021, volatility came way down, and the SMPU returned 28%.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.160]   What psychological effect does this have on investors,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.720]   considering how much has gone on over the past couple of
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.400]   years, and the US markets continue to outperform?
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.080]   Has the sell-off been totally valuation-based, or do you
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.800]   think there's a behavioral dynamic at play as well?
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.560]   Obviously, there's a million things going on right now.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.480]   The reason that the market is selling off today, of course,
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.820]   is Russia is going to war with Ukraine.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.600]   That's an easy one.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.520]   But the stock market has been selling off for a number of
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.960]   weeks now.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.880]   So you have inflation at its all-time high in the last four
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.320]   decades.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.720]   The Fed is tightening monetary policy.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.320]   Growth stocks have been crashing for a while now, for
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   a little over a year now.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.080]   We're arguably in the craziest housing market we've ever been
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.720]   in.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.560]   Interest rates are finally starting to rise.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.480]   We've had all these labor market and supply chain
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.480]   issues.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.280]   And then we've been in a pandemic for two years.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.560]   So the reasons are obviously noticeable.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.280]   And yes, all that stuff matters, but economic data and
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.520]   geopolitics don't always impact the market.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.640]   Sometimes the market simply ignores this stuff, and
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.600]   sometimes it's paying attention.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   So why is it paying attention more now?
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.840]   The simplest reason is price, because things have gone
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.440]   really well.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.040]   So Duncan put up this first chart here of the returns over
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.600]   the last three years.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.040]   So this is the S&P and the NASDAQ in 2019,
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.680]   2020, and 2021.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.880]   We've had phenomenal returns.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.360]   The S&P is up 100% from 2019 to 2021.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.120]   The NASDAQ was up 160% in that time.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.280]   So we've had these huge--
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.560]   so zoom out a little bit.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.600]   It's easy to know why stuff got destroyed.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.640]   Going back even further, the NASDAQ from--
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.720]   I looked at this yesterday--
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.760]   2009 to 2021 was up 1,400% more than that, 23% per year.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.960]   And it's like, there's no way this stuff can
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.680]   keep growing forever.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.320]   So why are my growth stocks getting crushed?
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.000]   Because growth stocks did so well for so long.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.920]   And the stock market, why is it falling this year?
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.280]   Probably because it went up so long.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.800]   Think about the 1987 crash.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.320]   I've read all the books, what happened and why.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.560]   Why did we have the worst one-day crash in history?
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.440]   Well, portfolio insurance and people were selling,
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.480]   and interest rates were rising.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.360]   Duncan, any guesses on the 10-year Treasury
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.520]   yield in 1987 crash going into it?
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.160]   No, absolutely no.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.760]   It was almost 10%.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.080]   Rates were rising 10%.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.000]   Put up the chart that shows what happened.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.440]   I think what a lot of people forget-- so this is the 1987.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.680]   That's unimaginable now.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.720]   It is, right?
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.600]   But this is-- so from 1982 to 1986,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.240]   stocks were up 200%, 300%.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.120]   And then, in the first eight months of the year,
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.080]   the stock market was up 40% in 1987.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.160]   And then we had the biggest one-day crash in history.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.280]   And there's all these market dynamic things and structures
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.720]   that went on.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.920]   But the biggest reason sometimes that stocks go down
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.040]   is because they went up.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.240]   And it's all psychological.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.700]   Like, if you're thinking about valuations and fundamentals
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.440]   right now, it doesn't matter at all.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.320]   And it's like, it shows how price changes.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.680]   Like, view how people-- so in bear markets,
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.400]   people-- prices are falling, and people
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.760]   think everything's just going to get worse,
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.880]   and you feel like an idiot.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.720]   And then things do get a lot worse.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.880]   But then they get a little less worse than they did before.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.240]   And things start rising.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.600]   And then stocks go up, and then you have a bull market.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.360]   And then everyone feels like a genius.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.360]   And then you realize trees don't grow to the sky,
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.280]   and things get better.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.240]   But they get better at a slower rate.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.560]   And then stocks log in, and prices roll over,
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.740]   and you have a correction.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.360]   And this is kind of the way this works.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.480]   It's like rinse and repeat.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.200]   It doesn't happen all on a set schedule,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.400]   because you could have said for the last eight years,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.000]   tech stocks are up too high.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.640]   They're moving.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.160]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.400]   So you don't know when this is going to end.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   But that's kind of the way to think about it,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.720]   is that sometimes when prices are higher,
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.540]   the risks for the lower returns are there,
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.760]   because things have been going so well.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.080]   Now, I don't know when this correction will end.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.960]   No one really does.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.420]   The one thing I can say with reasonable certainty
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.040]   is that we're going to see some violent moves in the coming
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.640]   weeks, I would say.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   So volatility tends to cluster when markets are going down,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.480]   because people panic.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.240]   And also, people want to pretend like they
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.040]   have both hands on the steering wheel,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.680]   and feel like they're doing something.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.680]   So that's why the best days in the market
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.720]   actually happened during downturns.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.480]   So we're going to see some violent rallies in the coming
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.640]   weeks, I think, as this thing--
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.720]   who knows how far it goes.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.160]   But that's the only thing I can say with certainty,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.040]   is that we're going to see some huge moves in both directions
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   coming.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.880]   New boil question of the day.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.000]   I don't remember.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.560]   When does something move out of being a correction
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.400]   into something more?
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.560]   Is there a certain threshold?
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.760]   If we're using the actual definitions,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.200]   a correction is down 10%, but less than 20%.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.600]   And if we look right now, the S&P 500 is in a correction.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.960]   I just looked before we started.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.600]   It's down 13%.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.160]   The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks is down 21%.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160]   The NASDAQ 100 is down 20%.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.720]   Those are bear markets.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.800]   Now, people make these determinations up,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.960]   but 20% is a bear market.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.360]   10% is a correction.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.320]   OK, gotcha.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.960]   And yeah, it brings back to memory all those questions
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.240]   we were getting about triple-weathered ETFs
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.760]   a while back.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.440]   Those things, if people are really big into those,
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.880]   those are really getting hit.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.960]   Yeah, and sometimes it doesn't even matter the reason.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.880]   People focus on the reason at the time
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.240]   because it helps them think that they can
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.600]   guess what's going to happen next.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.280]   But sometimes the reason doesn't matter,
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.080]   and this just happens, unfortunately.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.160]   This is part and parcel with risk assets.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.660]   Right.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.840]   Let's do another one.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.520]   OK.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.320]   So up next, we have--
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.000]   this is a question from North Carolina.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.320]   I believe Jacob-- let me double-check that.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.560]   Yeah, this is a question from Jacob in North Carolina.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.800]   Do you all have any advice or recommendations
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.880]   for how to handle taxes on crypto
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.440]   as tax season approaches?
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.440]   I had my first foray into DeFi last year
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.140]   and have quickly realized that the large number of transactions
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.240]   makes calculating my realized gains completely
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.360]   untenable without some sort of software automating it.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.400]   This is a good one.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.560]   So we get emails on a wide range of topics--
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.520]   markets, and the economy, and personal finance,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.800]   and retirement accounts, and all this stuff,
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.240]   and different types of investments.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.640]   By far, the biggest-- and we just
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.840]   had someone go through our inbox and totally clean it out
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   and put these different questions
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.920]   into different categories.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.480]   And by far, the biggest category is taxes.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.800]   This is why we have our man, Bill Sweeton, all the time.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.120]   So let's bring Bill on.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   He's our tax expert.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.720]   Hey, Bill.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.480]   Yeah, good to be back with you again.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.120]   Who would know?
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.080]   Tax question's really popular in late February.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.800]   Yes, I think it's a lot of that because we're
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.840]   getting closer to that.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.560]   But I mean, I guess people just hate paying taxes almost more
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.240]   than they enjoy making money.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.960]   So that's why people-- it's such at the forefront.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.920]   People just hate paying taxes.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.760]   And you know this.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.440]   How dare you steal my take?
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.720]   How dare you?
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   But the only thing I really know about taxes and crypto
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.920]   is there's no wash sale rule.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.400]   So if you wanted to sell now that crypto is lower,
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.480]   you could sell your Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or whatever,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.880]   and buy it back immediately, and just lock that gain in
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.680]   for tax purposes.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.760]   That's the extent of my knowledge
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.640]   for taxes for crypto.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.880]   What else is there to know?
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.480]   Correct, yeah.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.560]   Fails the Howley test.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.080]   It's not a security.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.160]   So let's talk basics, though, Ben,
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.640]   because this is a great question.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.000]   And crypto's a really volatile, really wild asset class,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.360]   really a lot of fun in the wild, wild west there right now.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.200]   Basics, what did you pay for the token when you bought it?
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.760]   What's your cost basis?
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.720]   When did you sell it?
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.920]   What's the exit on sale?
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.000]   And that gets complicated.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.720]   I'm going to talk about that in a second.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.000]   And then the dates on when the purchase happened
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.920]   and the sale happens, that's very important
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.200]   because that determines short-term or long-term
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.240]   capital gains.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.320]   So pretty simple and a real easy example.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.560]   I buy Bitcoin for $6,000, one Bitcoin, in February 2020.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.520]   I sell it this morning in February 2022 for $36,000.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.000]   I got a $30,000 gain.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.160]   Congrats, right?
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.640]   Guess what?
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.720]   You owe 15% long-term capital gains tax on that asset.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.480]   So you need to cough up about $4,500 of federal tax.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.960]   But what makes this really complex
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.680]   is when have you actually sold the token?
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.280]   And this is what a lot of folks that
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.400]   are kind of noobs in crypto land don't get.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.760]   If you sell it for cash, that's the obvious example.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.160]   What happens if you trade one currency for another?
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.800]   You flip your Bitcoin for Ethereum.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.760]   Guess what?
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.360]   That's a taxable transaction.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.560]   Let's say you use your Ethereum to buy something.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.560]   Let's say it's some asset, pizza.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.760]   It's a classic example from back in the day.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.080]   That's a taxable event.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.160]   If you get airdrop tokens from a hard fork,
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.040]   if you do any staking or mining, that's taxable income.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.960]   Or if you get paid in cryptocurrency
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.880]   to do a job, to do a gig, that is taxable income.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.400]   So all this stuff matters.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.600]   Let me cut to the chase.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.560]   There's a really great platform that I use called Taxbit.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.320]   This is not an endorsement, but I
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.720]   am familiar with the platform.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.360]   And it's great, because if you're
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.480]   able to link all of your custodian's wallets
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.120]   in one place, it'll give you some really awesome tax
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.720]   reports, including Form 8949, which
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.480]   you're going to need for your 2021 income tax return.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.960]   What if you are taking your Ethereum and buying NFTs?
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.720]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.720]   So again, you're flipping one token for another.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.440]   Is the IRS really on top of this, though?
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.900]   Like, do they know what's going on?
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.440]   Like, if you're in there flipping,
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.440]   if you're staking in DeFi land and you're
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.040]   using your Ether to buy NFTs, do they
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.520]   have any idea what that is?
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.740]   Or are people skirting tax laws at this point in there?
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.600]   Are people skirting tax laws?
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.520]   Like, if I pay my contractor in cash,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.680]   he's reporting that all the time as income, right?
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.880]   What makes cryptocurrency really interesting, Ben,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.160]   is that it's there on a chain, right?
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.240]   And so this is public to the extent
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.400]   that you can look at an address and you
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.000]   can see a transaction, right?
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.520]   So is the IRS-- are there agents in the IRS
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.040]   that have time to take a look at your Coinbase wallet
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.600]   and determine that you made a taxable transaction?
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.520]   I mean, God's honest truth is probably not.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.840]   They're still processing somewhere
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.920]   in the neighborhood of 8 or 10 million tax returns from 2020.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.880]   If you send them an 83(b) election or a form,
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.040]   I get those back about seven months later.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.740]   So that gives you an indication of how far behind the IRS is.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.200]   But they're catching up, and they're catching up every day.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.420]   And we're going to talk about this a little bit later.
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.600]   But there's a pretty big bomb coming January 1,
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.240]   2023, when all this stuff is going
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.860]   to start getting reported to the IRS.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.080]   And you can run, but you can't hide.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.680]   What level do you think Coinbase would need
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.440]   to get to stock market-wise before all of their best talent
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.840]   jump ship to the IRS?
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.920]   Yeah, unfortunately, the pay scale
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.080]   is a little different there.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.560]   They don't tend to compensate you.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.960]   I don't think the IRS is going to be paying anyone
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.880]   in Bitcoin, either.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.480]   No, it's government service, too.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.880]   But yeah, and again, we should charge them for this spot.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.320]   But check out taxbit.com.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.600]   That's the best platform that I've found for my personal use.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   It's not an endorsement.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.280]   So do your due diligence on that.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.520]   Let's do the next one, Duncan.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.020]   Cool.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.120]   OK.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.120]   So up next, we have a question from Bill.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.200]   Not this Bill.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.920]   What is a good tax-efficient strategy
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.520]   for withdrawing from a 401(k), Roth IRA, and traditional IRA
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.560]   while receiving a pension until eligible for full Social
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.720]   Security benefits at 67?
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.940]   Not expecting to need large withdrawals to live on.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.320]   This is another topic that's come up quite a bit is
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.400]   taking the assets down.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.960]   Blair and I talked about this on the last show a little bit.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   And so people trying to figure out,
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.040]   yes, I've accumulated all these assets, but now what?
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.800]   How do I take them out?
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.960]   Are there good rules of thumb for this kind of thing?
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.960]   Different accounts you want to take out earlier or later,
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.240]   spread them out a little bit, a little each?
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.960]   What do you think?
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.800]   Yeah, we covered this about three weeks ago.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.080]   It's a similar question.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.520]   Let me just start quickly, though.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.080]   Let me push back on the premise.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.280]   Each year that you defer on your Social Security
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.040]   benefit from age 62 all the way out to age 70,
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.840]   you get an extra 8% a year.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.200]   There is nothing magical about full retirement age
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.280]   outside of some other filing requirements.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.360]   If you file at 68, you get an 8% lifetime boost for your income.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.400]   So you do need to judge that, though, on life expectancy.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.520]   But if you expect to live till 83 or longer,
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.400]   and you look at family history, it probably
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.360]   makes sense to wait till 70.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.120]   But that said, I think it's important to think about,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.580]   how does this taxation work?
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.200]   And if you're able to live on a lower pension,
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.440]   that means your taxable income is probably low.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.320]   Duncan, John, can you pull up my chart?
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.120]   JG, let's do this thing.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.360]   Tax brackets matter.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.320]   And we talked about this, though, the last time
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.400]   that we had this call.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.160]   There's a really big tax jump that
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.600]   happens around the 22% tax bracket.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.520]   This is a merrily fine joint couple.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.440]   The pointed arrow is pointing to where
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.040]   you go from 12% to 22%.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.360]   That, to me, is a really magical place
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.820]   to think about in the tax code, assuming that your pension is
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.880]   below that amount.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.920]   Because you can take assets that are in traditional IRA
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.300]   that you have to start taking distributions from at age 72.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.120]   And front load those in the present.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.600]   And so if your income falls below a certain threshold,
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.080]   I would always look at that.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.680]   The very first Portfolio Rescue episode I was on, Ben,
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.640]   do you remember what the tattoo on my back reads?
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.440]   Roth IRA, right?
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.680]   Roth IRA conversion.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.600]   You're damn right.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.400]   And so that's the thing to think about.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.080]   Once you convert that asset to Roth,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.200]   you no longer have to pay tax on it again.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.700]   And so if you expect your income to be higher in the future
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.500]   after you file for Social Security benefits,
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.680]   it makes sense to front load some distributions
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.040]   or contributions in the present.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.500]   But unfortunately, like everything in tax,
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.700]   it all depends.
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.180]   All right.
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:47.940]   OK.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.160]   Let's do one more, Duncan.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.020]   OK.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.900]   So up next, question four we have
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.020]   is from James, who writes-- this is a fun one.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.820]   I hold season tickets for an NBA team.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.660]   They don't tell us which one, but I usually
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.240]   sell a portion of the tickets to recoup some of the costs.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.240]   I don't make a profit for the season as a whole,
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.900]   but for individual games, I will sometimes turn a profit.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.340]   Starting this year, Ticketmaster,
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.740]   where I'm forced to resell, has informed me
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.460]   that they are filing a 1099K for anyone
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.180]   who receives over $600 in a calendar year, which
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.300]   will include me.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.140]   Will I need to add ticket income to my tax filing?
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.740]   And if so, can I deduct the cost of season tickets
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.020]   against this new income?
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.060]   This is a strange one.
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.460]   Michael has season tickets to the Knicks.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.140]   I was wondering, shouldn't you get a write-off
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.740]   if your team doesn't make the playoffs
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.100]   or they finish under 500?
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.640]   If you buy season tickets to the Detroit Lions,
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.100]   the government should be paying you as a citizen
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.140]   for helping the economy.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.820]   Shouldn't you make the owner pay you?
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.860]   Something like that.
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.500]   So before we get into this specific one, Bill,
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.200]   I asked you yesterday, what are some of the strangest things
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.740]   you've seen on a tax filing?
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.180]   Because this one would--
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.340]   I think this one would count, right?
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.220]   NBA tickets?
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.300]   What have you seen?
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.100]   Yeah, twice.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.720]   And I talked about this with Bill Arts.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.340]   Shout out to Bill A, RCPA in Philly.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.460]   I talked about it with him.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.060]   The funniest thing I've ever seen twice was mascot expenses.
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.280]   And so when you're filing somebody's tax return,
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.820]   you kind of need to ask them questions
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.260]   when you see something funky like that come across.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.100]   So one answer was, it's our company mascot.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.360]   And I said, can you elaborate on what the mascot is?
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.940]   They were like, well, it's a doodle,
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.900]   and she cheers everybody up.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.540]   And so I was like, is that the dog that lives in your house?
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.740]   And are these actually dog grooming expenses?
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.580]   He was like, yeah, you got me.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.620]   Those, not deductible.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.100]   That's a personal expense, sorry.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.540]   The more interesting one happened.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.060]   Client-- home office, actually, but had a lobby, right?
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.260]   And so clients would come in.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.220]   I think it was a hairdresser or something like that.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:35.940]   People would come in.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:36.580]   They'd sit in a lobby.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.340]   And they'd wait.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.580]   And the mascot expense was for a fish tank.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.620]   And the idea was, well, people sitting in there
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.060]   waiting for somebody to see something nice to look at.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.460]   I actually allowed that expense.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.980]   I thought that was reasonable, ordinary, necessary.
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.320]   I would say mascot expenses.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.660]   The other really funky one that I've come across, though,
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.300]   is anything involving plastic surgery or other-- like teeth
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.100]   whitening, other personal expenses.
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.500]   And those typically are a no-no.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.580]   But those are the two weird categories that I see.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.660]   So what if this YouTube channel sticks around
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.460]   for another 30 years, and I get a facelift at age 60?
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.900]   Is that kind of the write-off?
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.300]   I've got to say, pretty.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.100]   I have a face for radio, so you're definitely
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:10.980]   speaking my language.
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.900]   But unfortunately, no.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.580]   The IRS is going to determine that to be a personal expense.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.740]   It's a personal appearance.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.860]   Same thing for clothing.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.820]   That's basically anything that's not a costume.
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.700]   If you can adapt it for civilian use--
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.260]   if I can wear this shirt to the club,
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.940]   and I do every Friday night--
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.900]   that's not deductible to me, unfortunately.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.740]   I've got to imagine this person, even though they're
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.980]   making income, they cannot deduct
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.820]   the cost of those tickets.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.940]   I have to imagine that's a pretty simple one, even.
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.060]   Yeah, it depends.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.740]   So that's, again, the freaking tax thing that sucks.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.220]   So just wait till this happens in crypto land, by the way.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.940]   That's what I was getting at before-- January 1, 2023.
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.260]   Brace yourselves, because 1099s are coming from Coinbase.
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.540]   But leaving that aside, the quick and dirty answer is yes.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.060]   You can deduct the cost of tickets,
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.380]   and you should deduct that against your cost of sales.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.020]   However, the way the taxpayer framed this question,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.980]   this smells a lot like a hobby to me.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.660]   This is not a bona fide business in the eyes
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.100]   of the Internal Revenue Code.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.260]   And what that means is you can and should
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260]   deduct the cost of your tickets, but only
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.780]   to the extent of your income.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.940]   If you go beyond that, you might be able to get away
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.020]   with it for a year or two.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.980]   But in order for a business to be bona fide,
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.660]   in order for you to be able to deduct expenses
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.300]   beyond your income, you need to be able to prove
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.740]   that you're in it for a profit.
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.860]   So to turn it into a business, he
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.580]   has got to be one of those guys that stands outside the stadium
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.620]   going, tickets, tickets.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.420]   Bingo.
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.620]   Yeah, and I've never bought a ticket
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.460]   from one of those dudes.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:24.780]   Have you?
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.060]   Because--
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.660]   No way.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.180]   I would not trust that.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:26.860]   Yeah, that kind of scares me.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.580]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.740]   So but regardless, I mean, if you're just sort of recouping
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.420]   tickets to cover your cost, that's
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.580]   probably really bad business in the eyes of the IRS.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.100]   So the natural question, again, is this going to be a hobby?
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.300]   Are you actually trying to generate a profit?
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.540]   I would probably Boy Scout honor,
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.140]   like if you want to play this straight,
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.620]   report it as a Schedule C entity on your tax return.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.660]   Report the total income on 1099(k).
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.980]   Match that with an expense that has no impact on your tax
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.700]   return.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.420]   Move on down the road.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.100]   And you should also always drive below the speed limit.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.220]   Cook your burgers to 500 degrees Fahrenheit
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.380]   and drink 40 gallons of water a day.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.020]   But this kind of thing, we'll see.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.220]   I don't know how serious the IRS is going to take it.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.740]   So I think as taxpayers, we got to play by the rules, guys.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.540]   Come on.
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.580]   My season tickets are buying a nice big TV
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.900]   that looks good in HD.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.620]   Yeah, and curiously, that's the ticket.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.220]   You have a better view in most cases.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.580]   All right, Bill, you served your country.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.180]   You've been involved in military conflict before.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.580]   I'm just curious, what are your thoughts and feelings
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.620]   on the day like today?
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.180]   Yeah, not to be a downer, but I'm horrified.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.060]   We have not seen large-scale war of this magnitude
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.820]   since 1945 in Europe.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.440]   I have a very good friend who's the best man at my wedding who
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.340]   is deploying to Eastern Europe today.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.380]   So I would just say, everybody out there,
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.420]   it sounds so trite, but this is a moment
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.860]   that should connect humanity.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.700]   And ultimately, I pray for the free people of Ukraine.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.660]   And I hope this all ends very quickly and satisfactory,
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.500]   because this is very serious business.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.340]   So thank you.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.860]   Please pray for my friend.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.140]   His name is Todd.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.500]   Right, well said.
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.500]   All right.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.780]   Thanks, everyone, for watching.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.780]   Duncan, are we going to do the giveaway now?
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.980]   So like I said, if you've been putting #100k, lowercase k,
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.780]   into the chat, we're going to pull from that here
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.340]   in a second with this cool little feature
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.060]   that StreamYard has.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.520]   Wow, look at the odds here.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.020]   Only 40 people entered today.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.180]   Wow, we had like 300 and some the other day.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.180]   So yeah, that's a pretty good odds.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.220]   Roll those dice.
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.060]   So yeah, let's go for it.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.940]   Let's hit it now.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.620]   Did you rig this, Duncan?
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.660]   I wish I was good enough coding to be able to rig this.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.620]   The question is, is this taxable income to Bits of Interest?
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.900]   OK, long time, long time viewer.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.780]   I definitely recognize their profile pic from the chat.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.100]   Your 1099k is in the mail.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.740]   Congrats.
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.820]   So yeah, so send us-- yeah, this is a taxable event, obviously.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.180]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.860]   But so send us an email at askthecompoundshow@gmail.com
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.740]   with your address and your shirt size.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.540]   And we'll get the shirt sticker and mug.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.920]   Ben doesn't drink coffee mug in the mail to you.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.000]   So yeah, congratulations.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.260]   This is something I think we'll do more moving into the future.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.700]   But today was to celebrate the fact that we're almost at 100k.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.440]   And hopefully by the end of the week, we'll be at 100k,
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.660]   because that's what I said on what are your thoughts.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.660]   All right, we're getting there.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.400]   All right, if you have a question for us,
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.220]   especially correction-related.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.540]   I'm sure a lot of people have a lot of questions right now.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.580]   The market's falling.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.340]   We're in a crisis.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.180]   Send us a question.
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.300]   Askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.620]   Thanks again to Bill for always being our taxman.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.380]   Thanks to Duncan.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.860]   And we'll see you next week.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.020]   See you, everyone.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.980]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.860]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.420]   (upbeat music)
