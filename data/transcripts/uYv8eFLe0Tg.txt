[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.100]   - Elon Musk is confident that large scale data
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.160]   and deep learning can solve the autonomous driving problem.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.480]   What are your thoughts on the limits,
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.000]   possibilities of deep learning in this space?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.160]   - It's obviously part of the solution.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.100]   I mean, I don't think we'll ever have a self-driving system
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.860]   or at least not in the foreseeable future
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.700]   that does not use deep learning, let me put it this way.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.060]   So in the history of sort of engineering,
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.080]   particularly sort of AI-like systems,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.440]   there's generally a first phase
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.560]   where everything is built by hand.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.800]   Then there is a second phase,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.840]   and that was the case for autonomous driving,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.000]   you know, 20, 30 years ago.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.400]   There's a phase where there's a little bit of learning
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.600]   is used, but there's a lot of engineering
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.580]   that's involved in kind of, you know,
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.160]   taking care of corner cases and putting limits, et cetera,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.920]   because the learning system is not perfect.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.180]   And then as technology progresses,
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.600]   we end up relying more and more on learning.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.480]   That's the history of character recognition,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.680]   the history of speech recognition,
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.960]   now computer vision, natural language processing.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.560]   And I think the same is going to happen
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.720]   with autonomous driving,
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.240]   that currently the methods that are closest
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.640]   to providing some level of autonomy,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.480]   some, you know, decent level of autonomy,
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.080]   where you don't expect a driver to kind of do anything,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.400]   is where you constrain the world.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.140]   So you only run within, you know,
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.900]   a hundred square kilometers or square miles in Phoenix,
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.140]   but the weather is nice and the roads are wide,
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.780]   which is what Waymo is doing.
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.820]   You completely over-engineer the car
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.060]   with tons of lidars and sophisticated sensors
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.820]   that are too expensive for consumer cars,
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.860]   but they're fine if you just run a fleet.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.260]   And you engineer the thing,
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.940]   the hell out of the everything else.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.500]   You map the entire world,
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.920]   so you have complete 3D model of everything.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.700]   So the only thing that the perception system
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.740]   has to take care of is moving objects
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.220]   and construction and sort of, you know,
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.040]   things that weren't in your map.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.700]   And you can engineer a good, you know,
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.140]   SLAM system and all that stuff, right?
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.380]   So that's kind of the current approach
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.020]   that's closest to some level of autonomy.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.180]   But I think eventually the long-term solution
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.960]   is going to rely more and more on learning
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.580]   and possibly using a combination
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.860]   of self-supervised learning and model-based reinforcement
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.900]   or something like that.
