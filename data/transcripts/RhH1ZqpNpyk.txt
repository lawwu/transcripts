[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.840]   We'll start with a question from Johnny.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.920]   Johnny asks, is there anything you'd
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.560]   add to how to be a straight A student for someone
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.560]   doing a part-time evening class postgraduate degree?
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.160]   Well, Johnny, I'll point out that you are actually probably
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.120]   in the majority of readers of that book of mine,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.400]   How to Become a Straight A Student, in that,
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.320]   as far as I can tell, the biggest audience for that book
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.960]   are non-traditional college students.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.840]   By non-traditional, I mean not doing
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.200]   four-year residential college.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.800]   There's a lot of part-time college,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.320]   returning to college later in life,
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.160]   coming to college on the GI Bill, first-generation students.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.240]   So there's a real interesting and diverse pool
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.400]   of people who come to that book that
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.360]   are all unified by this willingness to say,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.160]   this is a challenge.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.800]   I want to do well in this challenge.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160]   I'm looking for advice.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.680]   Traditional four-year, 19-year-old residential college
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.320]   students aren't usually so interested in advice.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.160]   As I've talked about before, college for them
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.400]   is also serving all these other roles.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.960]   It's a social experience.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.720]   It's a developmental experience as they
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.720]   try to emerge into their adult situations.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.380]   And they're not really thinking about,
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.680]   how do I structure my studying?
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.920]   But non-traditional students say, let's get after it.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.920]   Look, I'm paying money to take these courses.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.000]   I want to get good grades.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520]   I want to return my investment.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.120]   How do I study?
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.000]   Let's go.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.360]   So these are my people.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.440]   You are my people.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.000]   All right, so here's what I would recommend
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.800]   to keep in mind from that book.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.400]   If you're doing a degree part-time,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.800]   and in your elaboration, you know that your job's pretty hard.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.920]   So it's part-time.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.520]   It's at night.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.920]   You're exhausted.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.600]   A few things I'd keep in mind.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.040]   One, slow down.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.600]   To the extent possible, make sure you're not
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.880]   overloading the number of courses
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.360]   or the difficulty of courses that you're taking at once.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.960]   It's real easy as you're laying out
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.280]   your plan for how you're going to get this degree to say,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.720]   let's just pile it on.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.920]   Let's pile it on and just power through this thing.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.960]   And it's going to be so impressive.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.280]   Our energy to get this degree will push us through.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520]   Your energy to get the degree will not push you through
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.160]   when you're working long shifts and you're trying
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.360]   to do these courses at night.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.760]   So design a course schedule to the degree that's possible
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.520]   that is reasonable.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.600]   The number one thing you can do--
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.840]   I used to call this on my blog back when
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.360]   I was giving student advice.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.160]   And I would say, avoid heart attack semesters.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.720]   Because to me, a heart attack semester
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.280]   is where it is an unforced error.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.320]   You didn't have to, but you chose
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.040]   to build up a collection of courses
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.640]   that is uniquely difficult.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.160]   8 out of 10 of the issues I would
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.440]   hear from students who were drowning in their work
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.640]   were avoidable if they had just had a more reasonable course
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.120]   load.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.360]   So that's the first thing I want to emphasize.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.320]   Two, you want to automate to the degree possible.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.520]   Here is the work that is generated on a regular basis
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.400]   from each of my courses.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.680]   This is when I do each of these things of work
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.400]   and where I do it.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.960]   The reading for this class happens on Tuesday nights,
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.840]   and I do it here.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.340]   I don't come straight home from work.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.520]   I go to the library that's down the street from my house.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.220]   90 minutes is enough time to get that reading done.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.360]   I work on my lab reports first thing early Saturday morning
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.240]   before my kids' sports practices happen,
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.000]   figure out to the extent possible when
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.480]   and where all of the regularly occurring work
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.400]   happens so that you do not have to go through this thought
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.600]   process every day when you're tired and coming home
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.800]   from work, what should I do?
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.280]   Should I work on something?
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.320]   So I would suggest that if you're
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.720]   taking your classes at night, which it sounds like you are,
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.320]   consider to the extent possible connecting these workblocks
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.400]   to those classes.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.880]   As long as you're already in the cognitive mindset
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.120]   of scholarship, ride that wave.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.960]   I do the class, go right from the class
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.280]   to the library on campus.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.800]   Let's go.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.280]   I get the work done right there while the information's
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.280]   still fresh in my brain.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.120]   That's often quite efficient.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.000]   Three, really have to keep in mind the core formula
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.080]   from that book, which says when it comes to academic work,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.280]   the total quantity of work produced
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.840]   is the product of the time spent and the intensity
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.600]   of your focus during that time.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.720]   If your time is limited, the biggest
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.800]   knob you have to turn to get the same amount of work
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.160]   done in less time is that intensity of focus.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.880]   So when you're going to work, you go to a place to work,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.480]   and you've got to laser beam it.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.280]   You cannot, in your situation where
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.200]   you have limited time and mental energy,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.720]   you cannot, cannot, cannot do your school
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.600]   work with a phone with you.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.640]   You cannot, cannot, cannot do your school work
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.440]   while you're also jumping over to check MLB trade rumors.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.000]   You cannot be doing this back and forth context shift,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.040]   and you cannot be texting with people.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.560]   Everyone in your life needs to know
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.120]   that during your school work blocks, it is a black hole.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.800]   You can't get through to Johnny unless you
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.040]   call the emergency number.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.600]   He has his do not disturb cranked up to 11.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   He's very hard to get in touch with.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.960]   If you can really push that intensity of focus high,
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.120]   you are going to greatly reduce the time required.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.000]   And the final piece of advice I'm going to give
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.080]   is care about how you actually do the work.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.600]   Banish the word study.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.520]   Banish the word read from your vocabulary.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.640]   Those are way too generic.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.160]   Those are way too ambiguous.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.440]   You're preparing for a test.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.400]   How are you preparing for the test?
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.800]   And why are you doing it that way?
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.840]   Be incredibly specific.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   I'm putting this on index cards.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.000]   I'm going to review the index cards in this way.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.920]   And here's what the criteria I have to get to before I
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.280]   consider myself done.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.520]   Be incredibly specific about how you're going to do your work.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.040]   I'm not just going to quote unquote read.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.800]   I'm going to take this chapter, and here's
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.560]   how I'm going to take the information and what format
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.200]   I'm going to put it to, how I'm going to capture
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.880]   the relevant facts into a notebook.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.360]   And I'm going to capture them in a format that
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.040]   makes it as easy as possible to shift from there to studying.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.600]   Get specific.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.880]   And then when you're done with a test or a major assignment,
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.280]   do a postmortem.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.680]   What worked with my systems?
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.720]   What was a waste of time?
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.560]   What hurt?
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.800]   An upgrade.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.040]   Always be upgrading and evolving those systems.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.400]   Real specificity.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.000]   If you do those four things, if you keep your semesters
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.480]   reasonable, if you try to automate when and where
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.400]   the work gets done, if you pump up that intensity,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.920]   your phone is in another zip code
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.560]   when you're working on your schoolwork,
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.840]   and if you're incredibly focused on how you do the work
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.680]   and trying to improve those methods.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.160]   I tell people sometimes, by the way,
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.360]   your goal should be to write a book on how to study when
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.480]   you're done with college so that you're constantly
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.980]   thinking from the standpoint of what works and what doesn't.
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.440]   If you do those four things, you're going to ace it.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.920]   You're going to ace these courses.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.720]   It's not going to be that bad.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.080]   I am not just making this up.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.480]   Again, I hear from reader after reader
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.560]   who are in similar situations, and they often
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.640]   come back with the same response, which
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.120]   was, this was a lot easier than I thought it was.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.960]   I'm getting better grades than these younger
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.080]   kids in these classes, and I'm working a lot less.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.620]   Put these things into action, Johnny.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.000]   I think you're going to do great.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.220]   (upbeat music)
