[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.320]   Logan, what do you think the biggest misconception is
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.480]   about the gift card market?
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.160]   - The biggest misconception is right there in the name.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.800]   People think of it as a way to give a gift.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.240]   I professionally handle gift cards.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.400]   I touch gift cards all the time.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.180]   I never give gift cards as gifts.
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180]   The best way to use a gift card, the way I use them,
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.320]   is as a way to save money.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.940]   It's a way to get an additional discount
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.860]   on stuff you're gonna buy anyway.
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.180]   - So I guess that operates on the assumption
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.600]   that gift cards should cost less
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.900]   than the actual value of the gift card?
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.740]   - Yes.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.100]   You should never pay full price for a gift card,
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.900]   which I think is what most people's experience is.
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.580]   They go into a Walgreens because they need to get a gift
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.220]   for a party that they forgot
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.020]   that they were supposed to bring a gift to,
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.020]   and then they pay full price for a gift card off the rack
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.420]   to give to someone else.
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.940]   - If you looked at all your spending,
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.080]   forget your mortgage, rent, car,
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.100]   things that you probably can't play with gift cards,
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.860]   what percent do you think you're saving
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.700]   by taking advantage of gift cards
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.880]   for all your regular spending?
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.620]   - I think that around 15% is probably a good rule of thumb,
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.860]   that most stuff is somewhere between 10 and 20% off.
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.660]   All my purchases that aren't the mortgage,
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.780]   but my groceries, my Amazon, all that,
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.740]   that stuff is all at least 10% off.
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.780]   - Okay, so that's thousands of dollars a year, I assume?
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.140]   - For sure, yeah.
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.460]   - So we're starting with gift cards could be a way
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.980]   for the average person to save thousands of dollars a year,
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.260]   which is amazing.
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.800]   Some fun stats I pulled, global gift card market,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.340]   almost a trillion dollars within the US,
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.020]   about a quarter of that, so about $270 billion.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.900]   And the other one, fun random stat,
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.500]   thanks to Capital One for putting together
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.900]   this big report of gift cards that I'll put in the show notes
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.820]   with the average value of a gift card is $50.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.340]   So these are just fun stats I pulled.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.480]   Where I wanna kick us off is,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.540]   where are all these deals coming from?
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.220]   'Cause you said the average person is looking at this
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.940]   saying Walgreens $50 gift card to Target costs $50.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.420]   What's this other side of the world
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.480]   where gift cards are cheaper?
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.260]   - So a lot of stores, brick and mortar and online,
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.460]   they'll have sales, including even at Walgreens.
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.900]   Almost every week, Walgreens will have a few brands
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.140]   that are on sale.
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.340]   Where if you buy a $50 card or something like that,
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.700]   you might get $10 of Walgreens bucks,
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.940]   whatever their reward program is called.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.000]   And there's also straight up discounts.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.700]   So like Costco, for example,
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.660]   frequently has Uber and Instacart for 20% off,
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.060]   just all the time, year round, online, in store.
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.180]   So if you're looking in the right places,
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.980]   most of the stuff that you want is available
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.740]   one way or another at a discount.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.780]   And if you don't have the patience
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.300]   to check the gift card rack,
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.740]   like every time you're at the store, that's kind of a pain.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.460]   There are also secondhand marketplaces.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.620]   So we operate on a secondhand marketplace.
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.660]   So raise.com is one and cardcash.com is the other big one.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.420]   Even if you don't wanna like be a deal hunter,
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.780]   you just, you wanna buy something on Amazon today,
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.020]   there's also a place to just always get a discounted
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.660]   Amazon gift card, if that's what you want.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.860]   - So we're gonna come back to that.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.820]   We're gonna talk about that reselling thing.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.580]   We'll talk about the site I built,
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.820]   but coming back to the source of these, right?
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.540]   'Cause all these gift card reselling,
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.180]   they all are coming somewhere.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.060]   And for someone to sell to you
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.140]   or another platform at a discount,
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.500]   they have to have gotten a deal.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.940]   So we've talked about going to Costco, getting a deal,
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.140]   promotions at Walgreens, a few others that I found.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.700]   If you have restaurants and retailers
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.820]   that are local in your neighborhood, in your town,
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.740]   they're mailing lists.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.460]   There's a pizza shop that we love.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.820]   And around the holidays, they were like,
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.100]   "Hey, we're giving $60 gift cards for $50."
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.980]   Now, in this case, we track all of our spending.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.820]   So I looked and I was like,
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.780]   "How much do we spend at this pizza shop in a year?"
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.180]   And it's like, "Oh, we spent a couple hundred bucks."
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.300]   "Great, let's buy a couple hundred bucks of gift cards.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.300]   "We're saving somewhere $10 for every $60 we spend.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.140]   "Why not take it?"
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.460]   So that was one.
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.460]   One category that I haven't spent a lot of time on,
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.740]   but is a lot of the grocery stores
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.140]   can offer gift cards at either a discount
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.740]   or partnered with whether it's rewards
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.060]   or fuel points or that kind of stuff.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.700]   Is that a big part of this market?
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.740]   - For sure, yeah.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.860]   If you can make use of those fuel points
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.700]   or those rewards points at the store, that's a huge way.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.460]   So Kroger famously has these fuel points deals
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.860]   where for every gift card, you get four Kroger fuel points.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.740]   It is like something I've told my sister to do
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.060]   'cause she goes to Disney every year with the kids,
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.140]   is buy your Disney gift cards at Kroger.
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.900]   My sister drives a comically large truck
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.020]   'cause she lives out in the burbs.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.140]   And so she actually can get those 30 gallon fill-ups
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.860]   that you need at Kroger to maximize those fuel points.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.220]   And I'm like, "You're gonna spend all this money
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.140]   "at Disney anyway.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.220]   "Buy your Disney gift cards at Kroger,
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.020]   "fill up your truck for free,
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.940]   "and just do that all year long
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.100]   "as you're getting ready for the Disney trip
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.020]   "or the cruise or whatever."
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.380]   - And some of those, I noticed like the weekly flyers
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.780]   or things you hear from the grocery store,
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.700]   sometimes it's like on the weekends,
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.980]   Safeway seems to always do Forex points
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.820]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.980]   So those seem to be constantly happening.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.100]   Is that the case almost across the country?
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.460]   - Yeah, so Kroger and its affiliates,
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.540]   they're the largest grocery chain in the US.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.220]   So I think you might have Ralph's out there
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.060]   on the West Coast.
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.780]   - Somewhere, but there's not a good Kroger chain near us.
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.700]   We're a Safeway land.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.540]   - Gotcha.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.660]   In any event, Kroger runs a fuel points promo
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.780]   the majority of the time.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.500]   So probably three out of four weeks per month,
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.340]   there's a promotion.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.540]   And then Safeway, like you mentioned,
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.460]   there's usually specific brands that are on sale
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.940]   roughly every other week.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.420]   And then on top of that,
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.780]   you can usually stack on the weekends.
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.700]   There's usually a couple extra bonus points.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.140]   If you can make use of those points,
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.900]   then they're incredibly lucrative deals
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.100]   'cause you're frequently getting
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.260]   something like up to 25% value back in those points
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.540]   if you can use the points.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.780]   - Yeah, yeah, I won't go down this rabbit hole
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.060]   'cause I don't really understand it,
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.380]   but I know there is a hack out there
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.700]   for turning your Safeway points into Alaska miles.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.620]   So I'll leave it to you guys listening.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.460]   If you're a frequent Safeway shopper
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.700]   and want to rack up Alaska miles, go find--
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.500]   - If you live in Alaska, definitely do that.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.060]   - Yeah, I think you have to live in Alaska.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.620]   But if you live there, it's great.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.060]   A couple other ones, card-linked offers.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.340]   How big are the kinds of offers
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.940]   that you get from your credit card companies
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.460]   where you log into the website and they say,
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.580]   "Oh, this month spend 200, get 20 off."
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.100]   Can you use those offers to buy gift cards?
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.980]   - Sure, well, so those card-linked offers
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.180]   can be really lucrative.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.940]   We frequently see them for brands
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.060]   where you can't otherwise get gift cards on sale.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.220]   So one example might be like Tory Burch
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.500]   is like a luxury brand.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.820]   Their gift cards are not sold at grocery stores.
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.940]   The only way you get them is at a Tory Burch store.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.260]   But if you have a card-linked offer
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.860]   that's like spend 200, get 50 back,
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.100]   that can be really lucrative.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.060]   That's an example of a brand.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.620]   We might buy it for 10% off.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.060]   And so you're gonna make 10% on a 250 or $500 purchase.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.340]   I mean, it could be worth the trip to the store for that.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.020]   - Yeah, I have this kind of regular process
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.940]   of just scanning these offers
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.060]   to see what kind of deals there are.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.100]   I personally use the Card Pointers app,
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.060]   which auto adds all of them to your card.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.020]   And every now and then it's like,
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.700]   "Oh, I just got one, I didn't even know it."
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.180]   You can set alerts.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.180]   So anyone listening, I'll put a link in the show notes
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.660]   to the deal we have with Card Pointers.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.860]   What about apps that sell gift cards?
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.780]   I know there are a handful of things from Pepper to Flooz
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.260]   where you can buy discounted gift cards.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.860]   - Yeah, that's another great source,
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.140]   especially we call that like couch spend, right?
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.620]   It's like you're running your business from your couch.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.940]   You don't have to leave the house.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.540]   You can buy the stuff and then resell it.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.020]   And I guess I should also mention,
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.380]   'cause we haven't mentioned this yet,
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.620]   is when we say gift cards,
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.540]   when you go into a store,
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.900]   you're buying a physical gift card.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.700]   But when we talk about online deals,
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.700]   you're not necessarily buying a physical gift card.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.060]   So in the case of these apps,
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.980]   what you're really just getting are numbers and pins.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.460]   So if it's something that you can do
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.140]   just by copying and pasting numbers,
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.500]   then that's really appealing to people.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.380]   So Pepper, as you mentioned, that's been huge.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.980]   I sort of hesitate to talk too much about it
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.260]   just because you have to spend a lot of money
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.340]   in a short amount of time
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.460]   to get the really good deals from Pepper.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.580]   And also who knows for how long Pepper will continue
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.140]   to be a really great place to get gift cards.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.940]   But yeah, it seems like every year or two,
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.180]   an app comes around where they're losing money
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.980]   selling gift cards because they wanna increase revenue,
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.460]   they wanna increase users, things like that.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.260]   And if somebody is willing to subsidize the product,
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.620]   you should always buy as much of that product as you can.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.500]   And if it's a gift card, all the better,
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.820]   'cause it's like they're selling dollars for 50 cents.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.740]   Yeah, the only reason I'm gonna throw Pepper out right now
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.420]   is that there is a card-linked offer right now
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.460]   that I think is spend 75, get 35.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.000]   I don't think I have it on any of my cards
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.580]   'cause I used the one they had before,
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.700]   which was spend 50, get 15.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.940]   And there is a new user promo,
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.140]   which is to put in a six-digit code.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.660]   Mine's 622811, if you wanna support me or find your friend.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.500]   I'll put that in the show notes, which is 20 off 200,
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.780]   which means you could buy $200 of gift cards on Pepper,
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.780]   save 20 from the new user code,
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.780]   save another 35 from your card-linked offer.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.740]   Now you're already past 25% off.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.500]   And even for new users who haven't unlocked
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.700]   any of their special rates that sometimes go
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.820]   for people who really, really use the app,
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.820]   today, it was like effectively seven, 8% off Amazon,
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.500]   Nike, Lowe's, four, 5% off Walmart and Sam's Club.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.700]   So if you stack all those things together as a new user
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.460]   and you have these different promos,
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.340]   I still think it's pretty interesting.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.460]   The only caveat I will say is that
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.300]   you're not actually buying gift cards
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.980]   on the Pepper app at a discount.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.300]   If you buy a $100 Amazon gift card, you're paying $100.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.540]   Now, if you have a promo and you're a card-linked offer,
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.780]   you're maybe you're paying less.
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.340]   And then they give you these coins 14 days later
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.340]   that you have to use to buy more gift cards.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.700]   And so if you don't need more gift cards
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.460]   and you were to try to sell them to you,
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.080]   you wouldn't get full value.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.120]   And you're certainly not gonna get a discount on those.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.220]   So I did a quick little scenario of,
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.840]   okay, well, it says you're getting 8% back,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.820]   but what that really means is spend 100
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.820]   and get $108 of value, which is kind of like 7.4% off,
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.180]   not the full 8% off.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.260]   So it's a little confusing.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.100]   I think anytime someone turns their discounts
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.500]   into like a virtual currency,
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.740]   you should kind of always be a little wary,
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.740]   but I have gotten deals here.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.620]   I'm sure you have as well.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.220]   And my only concern is with these companies
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.260]   that are effectively losing money to grow,
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.380]   like you don't wanna be on the Pepper owes me
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.100]   thousands of dollars of coins
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.780]   when maybe the company stops working.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.100]   So I think if you can stack
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.140]   the right new customer card offers,
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.420]   it can be a great thing.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.060]   If you're not really exposing
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.420]   and spending tens of thousands of dollars,
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.900]   it's probably fine also,
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.580]   but I would not wanna buy $5,000 of gift cards a day
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.100]   for a year straight right now.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.100]   I think it would probably be too much risk for me,
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.420]   but I've certainly been known
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.100]   when I see a good deal there to pick one up.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.420]   - Yeah, if they don't care about any of this other stuff
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.420]   and they just wanna save like 50 bucks at Amazon,
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.020]   what was that six digit code again, Chris?
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.820]   - Yeah, yeah, 622811 is mine.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.460]   So if somebody wanted to sign up with that
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.660]   and if they had that card linked offer,
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.740]   as you said, I mean, that's like 25% off Amazon.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.660]   If you do nothing else,
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.020]   like why not take 50 bucks off of 200 at Amazon?
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.180]   Very easy way that just free money.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.100]   - And then there are some other places sometimes,
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.020]   Flues has an app that you can download
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.180]   that lets you buy gift cards.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.140]   I believe they're actually at a discount
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.660]   and I can't remember if you earn the discount up front
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.780]   or if it's more like Pepper.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.140]   - Flues is a genuine discount.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.100]   You earn cashback, but the cashback is real.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.060]   You can cash it out.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.700]   - Yeah, the rewards are lower.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.420]   I'm looking right now and it says Amazon is 2 1/2% off.
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.780]   So it might not be as lucrative,
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.060]   but there's no waiting for coins to deposit and all that.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.660]   I'm looking in the app as we speak
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.380]   and the referral offer is give your friends 25% cashback.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.660]   So I'll put the link in the show notes
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.900]   if someone wants to try it.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.660]   It's another source of gift cards.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.380]   I'm certain that that 25% back for a new user has a cap
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.020]   and it's not something where you could just
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.420]   indefinitely get that deal, but keep your eye out.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.900]   And then these are the kinds of things we share
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.300]   in the newsletter all the time.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.420]   So if anyone's not subscribed,
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.540]   just go allthehacks.com/email.
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.780]   And if there's a new app like this, we'll share it.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.900]   If there's kind of a really lucrative gift card deal,
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.140]   we'll share it and all that.
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.940]   I guess the only other one I didn't mention,
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.980]   and I'm curious if you have any other sources
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.940]   you're frequenting, but there are some websites
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.500]   that sell gift cards like giftcards.com
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.300]   that often have really high affiliate portal things.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.020]   So from Rakuten or anything you kind of find,
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.540]   there might be big options to earn cash back
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.740]   shopping at online gift card retailers.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.420]   - Yeah, giftcards.com had a bunch of great deals
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.220]   over kind of like the Black Friday period.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.940]   I think there were some portal bonuses.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.740]   People were getting as high as 10% back.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.260]   I mean, you could buy Visa gift cards with that even, right?
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.780]   So you don't even have to resell them to me.
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.580]   You can probably figure out how to use a Visa gift card
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.860]   all on your own, but that was great deals.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.620]   They'd have their own brand gift card.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.900]   So you go through your portal,
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.180]   you buy your giftcards.com gift card at giftcards.com.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.340]   Then you go back through the portal,
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.660]   you go back to giftcards.com,
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.620]   you buy something else with that,
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.380]   and you were earning portal cash back on both transactions.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.020]   You got the gift card at a discount.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.420]   As you start describing these deals,
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.780]   you can descend into a lot of complication.
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.060]   But I would say there are opportunities
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.180]   that are as simple as what you were saying with Pepper
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.580]   and just a couple of things.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.340]   And then on the more complicated end of the spectrum,
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.020]   giftcards.com when they're running multiple promotions
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.380]   on top of each other.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.660]   This episode is brought to you by Gelt.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.140]   Now, when it comes to building wealth,
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.740]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.620]   And as tax time gets closer,
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.140]   getting prepared now is so important.
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.860]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.100]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.500]   to handle everything for my personal and business taxes.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.140]   You can think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.660]   Of course, they have an in-house team
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.420]   of expert CPAs to work with,
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.180]   who can help you determine the most effective tax strategies
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.500]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.

[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.660]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.660]   Beyond that, the tax library you get access to as a client
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.540]   has dozens of in-depth guides
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.660]   on things like choosing retirement plans,
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.140]   taxes for parents, qualified business income or QBI,
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.380]   and much more.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.180]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.900]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,

[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.380]   Again, that's chrishutchins.com/Gelt,

[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.260]   to stop overpaying on taxes.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.540]   This episode is brought to you by Notion.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.220]   Now, I'm always juggling everything
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.740]   from goal setting for the business
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.340]   to outlining big projects to planning travel,
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.100]   and I do it all in Notion
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.620]   because it's so simple and beautifully designed,
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.980]   letting you combine notes, docs, and tasks
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.740]   into one seamless space.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.780]   And the new Notion AI is a single AI tool
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.860]   that does it all.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.060]   Search across Notion and other apps,
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.020]   generate docs in your own style,
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.620]   analyze PDFs and images, and chat with you about anything.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.620]   It feels like having a personal assistant
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.580]   built right into your workspace.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.700]   That makes Notion the perfect place to organize your tasks,
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.940]   track your habits, write beautiful docs,
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.700]   and collaborate with your team.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.620]   And the more content you add to Notion,
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.420]   the more Notion AI can personalize its responses for you.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.940]   I use Notion all the time.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.260]   It's been an absolute game changer for productivity,
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.340]   and I'm not alone.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.780]   Notion is used by over half of Fortune 500 companies.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.140]   Teams that use Notion send less email,
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.260]   cancel more meetings,
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.100]   save time searching, and spend less on tools.
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.900]   So try Notion for free

[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.740]   That's all lowercase letters,

[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.940]   So I was trying to figure out why
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:54.940]   ultimately some of these deals are paid for by the apps,
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.700]   like the Pepper is losing money, I'm sure,
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.100]   or at least subsidizing these.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.340]   But some of these are paid
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.860]   because retailers like to offer a discount
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.860]   to gift card brokers, to the grocery stores,
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.100]   to run these promos, maybe their own business.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.420]   And some of it was to grow,
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.900]   but on that same report I pulled on stats,
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.780]   I found it interesting that 61% of consumers
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.580]   spend more than the gift card value.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.660]   So if you're wondering why would retailers
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.140]   want to discount their product in the form of gift cards,
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.780]   well, it turns out people spend more than the gift card.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.220]   And then 29% of people in this survey
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.060]   have had a gift card expire,
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.340]   and 43% have unused gift cards,
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.260]   and that the total unspent gift card market in the US
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.580]   is $23 billion.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.820]   So I guess there is breakage here.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.180]   My experience here is that
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.180]   many gift cards don't really expire.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.980]   Is that kind of a thing of the past,
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.260]   or how do you think about gift cards and expiration?
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.700]   - My understanding is that there was a federal law passed.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.300]   I believe gift cards aren't allowed
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.100]   to have inactivity fees or expire.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.780]   I want to say for the first five years
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.420]   or something like that,
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.340]   but the practical effect of that
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.660]   was that most companies switched
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.860]   to having no expiration at all,
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.860]   just because it was too hard to follow.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.300]   Different states have different laws,
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.660]   and there's federal laws on top of that.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.740]   And so rather than deal with
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.220]   all those individual different laws,
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.820]   what a lot of companies have done
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.780]   is they just don't expire.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.260]   So it's pretty unusual to have a gift card expire,
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.100]   except for like a Visa gift card or a MasterCard.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.460]   Those do have expiration dates,
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.300]   but for a closed-loop gift card,
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.020]   it's unusual for it to expire.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.620]   So closed-loop is what we use to refer
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.940]   to all third-party gift cards,
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.700]   by which I mean like an Amazon gift card,
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.700]   like a store gift card.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.820]   The alternative to that, an open-loop gift card,
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.660]   that would be like a Visa gift card,
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.220]   a MasterCard gift card,
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.020]   those kinds of like good-as-cash type cards
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.100]   that you might see at the store.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.340]   - And I assume that's because
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.260]   once you have the Home Depot gift card,
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.220]   you've got to spend it at Home Depot.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.980]   And I'm guessing that you probably
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.700]   can't use a Home Depot gift card
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.980]   to buy more gift cards at Home Depot, or?
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.820]   - Correct, yeah.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.260]   If you find a store that lets you
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.100]   use gift cards to buy gift cards,
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.020]   you've kind of got a golden goose there.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.940]   - Logan's like, "Send me an email."
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.340]   - Yeah, send me an email.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.780]   That's a very good deal if you find a place
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.420]   that'll let you buy a gift card with a gift card
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.740]   that opens up all kinds of shenanigans.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.780]   And as a result,
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.460]   most of the places that you could do that,
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.380]   people did shenanigans there.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.300]   Then the store,
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.980]   an auditor probably asked what was going on
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.020]   and they shut it down.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.740]   - That's kind of the supply
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.700]   of where all these are coming from.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.900]   Where are you monitoring all these deals?
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.740]   'Cause you're staying on top of this more than I am.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.300]   We met in person twice,
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.140]   and I feel like you were like,
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.300]   "Oh, there's an alert, I gotta go post this thing."
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.340]   How are you staying on top of all this?
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.380]   - In the case of Pepper,
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.260]   which has been super busy lately,
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.860]   that's as simple as opening the app and refreshing it.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.300]   There are deal aggregation websites.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.340]   So GCAnywhere.com,
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.260]   they post about gift card deals.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.340]   There used to be a place called GCGalore.com
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.220]   that unfortunately doesn't exist anymore,
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.500]   but they were an excellent source.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.100]   But even places like SlickDeals or DoctorOfCredit.com,
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.380]   those are good sources as well.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.060]   As it is my job professionally to know gift card deals,
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.220]   we have some tools internally that help find deals
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.940]   and alert me to their presence
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.540]   so I can post them for our users.
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.060]   And one of my friends has never sold
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.980]   a single gift card to me,
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.820]   but maintains an account on my website
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.980]   just because he likes to know about the gift card deals
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.100]   that we post so that he can go buy gift cards for himself,
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.580]   which is not really the way the site is intended to be used,
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.780]   but it doesn't hurt anyone.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.340]   Email's pretty cheap, so I'm not upset about it.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.180]   But yeah, technically we're also a way
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.540]   to find gift card deals.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.260]   - Yeah, and scanning your card-linked offers
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.420]   probably regularly, email lists from retailers
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.780]   that you frequent.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.180]   And then are a lot of these deals online
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.100]   or do you sometimes have to go into the physical store
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.060]   to get a gift card?
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.060]   - There are definitely in-store only deals.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.740]   We talked about Kroger and Safeway.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.300]   Those are examples where the good stuff
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.540]   is gonna be in store.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.460]   From my perspective as a middleman
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.020]   who's trying to make money on reselling gift cards,
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.860]   my favorite deals are like hyper-regional
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.140]   local grocery stores.
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.700]   We track deals even from individual stores.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.980]   There's like five stores in Utah that we track
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.180]   that occasionally have great deals.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.740]   So oftentimes it's these obscure local grocery chains
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.780]   will sometimes have killer gift card deals.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.260]   And you have to go in-person, in-store to get those deals.
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.300]   That being said, there's plenty of online stuff
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.820]   as we already talked about with the apps
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.420]   and giftcards.com and things like that.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.460]   There's deals in both places.
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.420]   But if you think about economics 101 and supply and demand,
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.140]   if there's a deal that's only available
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.420]   at five stores in Utah
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.620]   and you live next to one of those stores,
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.180]   then the market, if you plan to resell those gift cards,
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.820]   will be much more favorable
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.020]   because you'll be the only supplier of them.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.740]   So yeah, we definitely encourage people to go in-store
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.060]   if they start to do this seriously as like a side hustle.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.540]   - And before we talk about reselling,
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.300]   what are some of these great deals you've seen?
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.700]   Just give people some examples
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.260]   of maybe over the last couple of years,
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.660]   what are some recent great gift card deals
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.260]   outside of the Pepper app, that kind of stuff?
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.100]   - Sure.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.260]   I mean, right as we speak,
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.820]   the major grocery chain in Central Texas is called HEB.
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.900]   Right now they have a spend 100, get $30 deal
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.100]   on dozens and dozens of brands.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.540]   There are these new cards called Zift
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.500]   that you can convert into other brands.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.980]   And so we're talking about things like Airbnb,
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.860]   Bell, Xbox, PlayStation, things like that.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.060]   So just dozens of brands
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:32.500]   and it's spend 100, get $30 of HEB gift cards for free.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.020]   I mean, that's a pretty crazy deal
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.180]   because if you live in Central Texas,
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.460]   you're gonna buy groceries one way or the other at HEB.
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.820]   And then certainly during Black Friday,
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.580]   there were like countless good deals.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.100]   My friend Rob, who was also one of our biggest sellers,
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.740]   he, when there's a good deal,
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.540]   he treats it as like a full-time job.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.940]   And he was buying,
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.340]   I think the hot deal that he did the most of,
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.100]   they had Best Buy, buy 100, get 20,
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.660]   and they had Home Depot as well, buy 100, get 20.
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.220]   Like if you're building a deck or something,
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.580]   you're gonna need a lot of Home Depot gift cards.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.660]   To be able to get free groceries for the next couple months
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.220]   because you're making a big Home Depot purchase,
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.100]   that's a big win.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.540]   - Okay.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.820]   And was that one where, I remember the Best Buy one
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.620]   and I was like, well, I have one Best Buy account,
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.980]   I spend 100, I got 20 back,
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.900]   but I didn't get much more than that.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.460]   Was that one where if you go into Best Buy,
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.540]   maybe you could take advantage of it multiple times
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.860]   versus online, it was limited?
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.140]   - Yeah, so frequently Best Buy will limit you online
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.940]   to like two or three cards per deal per account.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.140]   But often in store, if the deal's available in store,
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.620]   the limit is, I believe either 2000
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.300]   or $2,500 per person per day.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:46.220]   And so my loving wife has graciously allowed me
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.980]   to drag her along to multiple Best Buy stores
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.660]   so we could each buy the limit
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.780]   and then drive to the next store and each buy the limit.
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.180]   But yeah, oftentimes the scalability
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.740]   really happens in stores.
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.820]   So if you need a lot of something,
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.980]   you do often end up needing to go in store.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.540]   - Does that mean you and your wife each
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.380]   are buying $2,000 gift cards?
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.980]   Is this just one transaction?
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.500]   And do they ever give any pushback when you try to do it?
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.860]   - You definitely get pushback.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.340]   The limit is either 2000 or 2,500, but let's say it's 2000.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.700]   The store manager often knows that.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.620]   Oftentimes the cashiers are uncomfortable
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.340]   running that many transactions.
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.260]   The other thing is, I believe the register
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.300]   at Best Buy specifically is limits you
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.420]   to three or five swipes per transaction.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.420]   So it's really multiple transactions
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.260]   to get to that $2,000 limit.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.420]   Some places they'll just refuse to sell you the gift cards.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.660]   And I never argue with anyone.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.980]   I'll politely suggest that that's not what I've heard
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.100]   in the past, but ultimately it's usually not worth your time
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.940]   to get in an argument when you could just drive
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.820]   to another store.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.820]   - That makes sense.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.620]   And like Costco limits you online to,
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.340]   I think like once a week, but in store,
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.260]   there's a per transaction limit.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.300]   But if you were to go to a couple of different Costcos
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.660]   or come back later or have a partner there,
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.620]   it's a little easier.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.500]   And I don't think there's any kind of hard
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.100]   system enforcement in the store, so.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:05.940]   - Correct.
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:06.780]   - Yeah.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.380]   So focusing on kind of the consumer buying gift cards
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.100]   and then we'll jump to resellers.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.220]   What are some of the mistakes people make
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.660]   trying to save money using gift cards
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.340]   and how can we help people avoid those mistakes?
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.660]   - I would say if you're not getting,
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.380]   if you're buying like a major purchase, like an appliance,
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.500]   you should also consider that if you put it
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.980]   on a credit card, your card may or may not have
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.540]   some kind of extended warranty protection.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.780]   And so you need to weigh the value of the discount
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.900]   that you're getting on the gift cards
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.660]   versus what you might be giving up
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.180]   if you value that warranty
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.620]   or if you value those other things.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.900]   Another thing that is a trade-off is
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.060]   if you're buying these gift cards to make a purchase
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.700]   that you might return, so clothing comes to mind,
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.980]   then it can be very annoying if you go back and return this,
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.580]   they're not gonna give you cash for your return generally,
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.780]   they're gonna give you gift cards.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.140]   And so if you're the type of person who buys
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.740]   everything in three sizes and you have it shipped
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:04.980]   to your house and you try it on
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.020]   and then you send back the ones you don't want,
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.460]   then gift cards could be a bigger mess than it's worth
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.980]   because you're gonna end up with a bunch of gift cards
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.260]   in weird denominations and you may lose them
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.100]   over the course of however long
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.380]   until you shop at that store again.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.700]   So there are definitely trade-offs
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.020]   and you should make sure that the value that you're getting
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.460]   from the discount is worth those trade-offs.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.220]   - So I remember one time we went to the Costco,
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.660]   I bought some gift cards, I was telling my wife,
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.060]   "We're gonna save all this money."
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.380]   And then I couldn't find one of them.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.420]   And I was like, my wife pointed out, she goes,
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.540]   "Well, you spent $600 on gift cards
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:43.060]   "and you feel like you might've saved a hundred bucks,
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.580]   "but a hundred of those dollars of gift cards
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.980]   "you seem to have lost."
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.580]   So my one question, obviously don't lose your gift cards,
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.140]   but if I were to buy a gift card
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.620]   and it was for a physical retailer,
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.300]   this was for a restaurant,
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.780]   do you think I could take a picture of it
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.580]   and show them that?
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.860]   Or do I really need the physical gift card
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.980]   in a lot of these cases?
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.380]   Obviously, I know with Uber, there's just a code,
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.140]   you scratch it off, you can redeem it on your account,
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.660]   but are there any gift cards for restaurants
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.020]   and retail chains where, if as an insurance policy,
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.780]   you take a picture of it, that could cause you problems
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.820]   redeeming it in store?
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.300]   - I think that most decent stores,
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.140]   you're their customer and they don't want
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.500]   to provide bad service and so taking your money
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.580]   and not giving you what you bought would be bad service.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.420]   I think that taking a picture would usually work.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.660]   It used to be called Raise, now it's called GCX.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.660]   Their app, it's a marketplace,
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.140]   but they also let you load your own gift cards
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.260]   into the wallet on their app.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.540]   And so, me personally, even gift cards
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.820]   that I don't buy on there, I load into that app
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.500]   so that I don't forget about them
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.820]   and I can just go through my wallet
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.900]   and then if I, whatever I spend,
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.060]   you can mark how much you spent
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.300]   and you can see how much is left
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.460]   'cause there's places where,
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.540]   we have Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas here
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.940]   and I don't go to the movies every week,
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.460]   but if there's a good deal on gift cards,
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.980]   I might buy a bunch and just spend them down over the year.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.980]   I don't wanna lose them and I know that I will lose
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.540]   the ones I buy at Costco if I don't do that.
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.300]   So I keep everything electronically.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.140]   - Yeah.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.500]   The other big one for me is just make sure you think about
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.860]   how much your time is worth, right?
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.940]   If you're gonna save $20 buying this gift card,
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.620]   but you have to drive 45 minutes to get it,
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.460]   was that a good deal?
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.620]   Like, I'm not gonna tell you what your time's worth.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.580]   Now, if you're walking out of Costco
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.540]   and you spend any money at Uber Eats, Instacart, DoorDash,
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.380]   and you don't just pick up one of those gift cards
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.780]   to save 20%, I feel like that's a little bit
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.540]   of a lost opportunity.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.380]   - I agree.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.740]   I mean, you're leaving money on the table
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.420]   if you go in person to Costco,
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.020]   which is like a two hour ordeal.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.100]   If you're gonna do that anyway,
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.740]   you might as well get some Uber for 20% off.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:44.860]   - Assuming you spend on Uber
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.980]   or you wanna get into reselling.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.580]   So I wanna talk about reselling.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.940]   How does this market work?
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.900]   - It's a lot like eBay.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.060]   I mean, in terms of like, if you were to go to Raise,
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.660]   now it's a subdomain, it's gcx.raise.com.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.900]   You're presented with a marketplace
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.620]   that looks somewhat like eBay,
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.220]   except that everything is organized by brand
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.100]   and denomination because all you can sell are gift cards.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.460]   You can't sell physical goods.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.300]   Also, unlike eBay,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.460]   you can't tell who you're buying the gift cards from,
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.860]   but an advantage is that Raise acts
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.620]   as a kind of a middleman or like a guarantor
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.860]   that the cards will be good
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.620]   and they offer a warranty and things like that.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.980]   A lot of the gift cards are supplied professionally
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.900]   from people that sell gift cards to places like us.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.220]   In fact, most of the gift cards on Raise
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.740]   come from my company.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.820]   And it's a similar story with like Card Cash
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.180]   is another reseller website.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.220]   And again, those tend to be professionally supplied.
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.740]   I think a lot of people might think
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.180]   that the secondhand gift cards are from people
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.220]   who got a gift card for Christmas, for Starbucks,
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.860]   but they don't drink coffee, things like that.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.060]   But the vast majority of the market
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.380]   are people who are buying gift cards
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.740]   for the purpose of reselling them
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.020]   because they have a business reselling gift cards.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.300]   - Which means that if you go to Costco
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.460]   and you see there was that sale
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.660]   where the Uber gift cards were actually $75.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.180]   So 25% off.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.540]   And if you're like, well, I never take Uber,
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.540]   there might be an opportunity to buy that gift card
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.100]   and sell it and make money.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.380]   That for people that don't know,
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.660]   that's kind of the premise of your business
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.420]   is you create a place for people who want to buy gift cards
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.780]   either as an amateur or professional
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.900]   to find a place to sell those gift cards.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.380]   And it's not really for the person
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.100]   who got a $25 Starbucks gift card and doesn't want it.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.660]   Though I assume if you're buying Starbucks gift cards,
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.340]   they could sell you one of those as well.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.900]   But how does that work for people who maybe are thinking,
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.020]   gosh, should I start buying gift cards when I see a deal?
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.060]   - That's how I got started.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.780]   I saw some discounted gift cards.
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.820]   I saw there might be an opportunity to flip them.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.660]   I probably saw it on Slick Deals or something like that.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.220]   And I got some for myself and then thought,
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.180]   well, this is such a good deal.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.540]   I bet I could resell these and make some profit.
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.380]   So there's definitely an opportunity there.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.140]   And we have several members on our site
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.900]   who have made a full-time job out of it, more or less.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.060]   There's at least one guy who flies around the country
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.740]   to wherever the best deal is that week
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.780]   and just professionally buys gift cards,
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.500]   driving around the stores all day long.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.540]   Obviously, that's not what most of our users are doing.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.020]   That's like a handful of people.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.740]   But yeah, I mean, there's every range of people
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.300]   who are hobbyists, who are grabbing a couple Uber
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.180]   when they walk out of Costco, as you described,
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.700]   all the way up to people who treat it as a full-time job.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.500]   - If someone were to say, I'm committed,
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.380]   this is gonna be my full-time job,
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.460]   what would you guess the annual kind of profit
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.100]   from that full-time job could be?
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.460]   - I do know some firm numbers
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.420]   because I asked my friend Rob, who also resells to us.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.140]   He has a bunch of little side hustles.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.060]   And when there's a good deal, he goes all in on this,
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.700]   which there's not a good deal
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.100]   in your specific location every week.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.300]   But when there's a good deal, he goes all in.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.100]   And so for the week around Thanksgiving,
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:55.100]   he bought $67,000 of gift cards all at HEB.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.500]   He made almost $5,000 in cash profit.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.020]   And then he bought it with credit cards.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.260]   And so he earned points and cash back
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.420]   from his credit cards as well,
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.300]   around $2,000 or so from that.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.380]   This is a professional who did it full-time
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.900]   during the best week of the year to do it.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.940]   He made $7,000 that week.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:11.900]   That's pretty substantial.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.180]   But I also don't want people to think
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.260]   that they're gonna buy two Uber gift cards at Costco
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.500]   every day and now they're making $7,000 a week.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.220]   That's an exceptional example,
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.340]   but that's kind of the ceiling.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.180]   - And what are the kind of general margins in this world?
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.820]   If we take that Uber 25% off,
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:33.020]   how many hands does it pass from the person who buys it
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.940]   with the intent to resell it
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.340]   before it makes it to the consumer
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.980]   who's gonna actually use it?
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.820]   - Sure, so in our case,
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.900]   if you were to go to Costco and buy the gift card,
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.180]   Costco touched it, and then you touched it,
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.500]   and then you sell it to our site.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.660]   Now we're at three people.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.100]   We would put it on like Raise probably.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.500]   So that's a fourth person.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.180]   And then somebody would buy it from Raise.
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.420]   So that's a fifth person.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.020]   So if you're buying something on Raise,
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.860]   quite likely you're the fifth person
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.460]   to handle the gift card.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.500]   - And should that be risky to consumers?
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.820]   Should I be worried if I'm buying gift cards
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.780]   from someone like Raise?
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.380]   Or we'll talk about the site I built
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.220]   that we kind of, I've worked with you a little bit
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.260]   to get your feedback on.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.980]   And should I be worried if I'm buying these gift cards
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.580]   that five other people might have seen the code?
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.060]   And is there a lot of fraud in this industry?
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.900]   - The amount of fraud that we experience
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.580]   among our members is very low
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.660]   because our members tend to be somewhat professional.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.540]   They're doing this as some kind of business.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.220]   And we have know your customer requirements.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.740]   There's a delay to get paid.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.820]   So that creates some security
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:42.180]   that if people upload completely bunk card information,
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.020]   they won't get paid.
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.100]   The user gets a refund.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.420]   I think that the risk is similar
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.780]   to if you were to buy one in a store
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.180]   because there's also fraud that can take place
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.460]   with physical cards where people will swap out a card,
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.420]   they'll write down the card information,
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.260]   the card you activated,
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.180]   the register won't be the one that you're actually buying
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.460]   'cause they've done a swap.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.540]   There is a risk of fraud.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.060]   I don't think the risk is substantial though.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.300]   And I think that if you buy from a reputable place,
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.340]   they'll make you whole.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.580]   And so it's just not a major worry, I don't think.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.340]   - Yeah, I mean, I think you said it in a more casual way,
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.820]   but you have a policy with the people you sell to
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.180]   as do a lot of these resellers,
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:17.740]   like you will guarantee those cards.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.180]   I'm looking at Uber gift cards.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:23.300]   And if you wanted to buy 20 or 30 $50 Uber gift cards,
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.740]   you're probably getting somewhere between 10 and 12% off,
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.860]   even though at the source,
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.820]   someone might've gotten 25, 20% off.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.260]   And so, you do a service, you take a little,
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.380]   raise takes a little.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:41.420]   Is that kind of split evenly or how does that work?
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.500]   Like, is there a way to get a better deal
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.660]   going directly to you or going directly to people?
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:49.220]   - Yeah, I mean, the more middlemen you can cut out,
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.620]   the better a deal you're gonna get.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.060]   So the best deal that you're gonna get
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.460]   on an Uber gift card is to go to Costco
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.140]   when they have a 25% off sale.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.460]   And so if you've got a time machine,
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.700]   perhaps one of the least economical uses
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.820]   of that time machine would be to go back in time
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.980]   and get Uber gift cards for 25% off, right?
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.260]   The worst option probably would be
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.180]   like a marketplace like Raise.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.260]   They take a pretty hefty commission.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.180]   I can tell you it's many times larger
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.780]   than the amount of margin that we make on something.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.260]   So, if each person is making at least a couple percent,
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.500]   then obviously the more people you can cut out, the better.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.980]   And Raise has bigger fraud concerns
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.700]   being more open to the public,
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.340]   but more private marketplaces,
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:28.940]   like the one that you're building,
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.460]   there's lower fraud risk, it's touching fewer hands.
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.300]   And so the rates should be better there.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.140]   - Yeah, I've compared it.
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:35.980]   I approached you and I said,
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.740]   "Why don't you sell gift cards to the public?"
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.620]   And you were like, "I don't wanna get into the world
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.940]   of opening this website
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.300]   and having all of these potential bad actors
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.580]   and everyone seeing it."
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:49.500]   And I realized that the thing I had that you didn't have
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.540]   and Raise in some ways probably is a private audience,
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.260]   an audience that isn't just on the internet
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.780]   where I'm not marketing to random people
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.380]   trying to attract customers.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.020]   So I said, "Oh, what if I bought gift cards from you?
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.020]   Could we resell them to our audience?
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.100]   Benefit from the fact that you are standing behind them
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.380]   with a guarantee for a period of time
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.060]   that is more than enough to use them.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.220]   So people shouldn't be worried
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.460]   about that kind of fraud concern.
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.700]   And what if we just didn't really make it
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.820]   to the public all the time?
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.140]   What if we opened it for windows of time
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.580]   and made it available?"
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.820]   And so I've shared it in the newsletter,
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.860]   but I was waiting for our conversation
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.860]   to put it in the podcast.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.740]   So if you go to allthehacks.com/giftcards,
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.060]   it'll redirect to it.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.100]   I'm not gonna keep it alive all the time
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.020]   'cause I don't wanna get in the business of this.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.380]   And I think one of the fun things I'll share,
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.820]   which I kind of hinted at with you,
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.500]   is I'm experiencing some
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.700]   of why you probably aren't doing this.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.340]   Like fulfilling orders,
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.100]   just taking a batch of codes for Amazon
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.300]   and getting them to people
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.620]   and responding to emails and questions
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.980]   and payment issues and all that stuff.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.300]   It's a lot of work.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.500]   And we discussed the pricing here, right?
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.540]   If from Costco, giving some of that profit
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.740]   to the person who buys it,
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.180]   some of it to the person who aggregates it in the middle,
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.300]   what you're doing,
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.620]   and then some to the person who's selling it.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.580]   And you mentioned that Raise takes even more.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.220]   And I'm looking at the cheapest gift card.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.300]   It's 13% off.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.620]   Like that's only 7% split amongst three parties.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.580]   One of which Raise is taking a bigger chunk
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.660]   and I'm trying to offer something lower.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.780]   So we're talking about one to two to 3% max
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.220]   that could kind of go to any party in the middle.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.420]   So it's a bit of a volume game.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.540]   But I've found that if I can do it
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.180]   for short windows of time,
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.620]   I can kind of aggregate the work,
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.020]   increase the volume
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.220]   and make it not a complete waste of time.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.580]   And so it's been fun to learn how this operates,
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:52.060]   but the idea of working with dozens and dozens of brands
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.500]   or hundreds of brands feels like it can get overwhelming.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.100]   And so, you know, when I've been talking to you,
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.780]   I'm like, let's specialize in five, 10 brands.
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:03.780]   You don't think you're gonna pack up the podcasting empire
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.060]   and just become a full-time gift card salesman?
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.100]   I do think it's interesting because when you go to Raise,
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.300]   like the deals are not as good as they could be.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.500]   And that was why I started this site.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.460]   I said, "Hey, Logan, what would it cost me
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.660]   to buy gift cards from you?"
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.300]   And the answer you gave me was,
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.860]   "It will be cheaper than you could buy online,
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.860]   but to make it worth my time,
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.060]   you need to spend at least five figures with me."
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.660]   Because like I've learned,
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.060]   there's just a lot of fulfillment issues.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.940]   And I said, "God, five figures?
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:32.620]   There's not a lot of retailers
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.060]   that I'm spending five figures at."
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.300]   And so, if you wanna save up,
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.180]   I'm sure if someone's all ready to go and says,
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.460]   "Logan, I wanna spend $30,000 on gift cards.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.380]   Can I make a one-time purchase from you?"
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.140]   Maybe they could email you, maybe you'd wanna do it.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.700]   But you're looking for people you can sell five to six,
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.820]   maybe even seven figures of gift cards to
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.380]   in the course of a year.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.860]   And so if I can be that channel
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.780]   to directly engage with our audience,
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.580]   maybe a week or two every quarter,
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.780]   then I can fulfill the needs you have for volume
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.380]   to get the rates, add on enough to make it worth my time
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.060]   and still beat the deals at raise.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.820]   And I think everyone wins.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.260]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.740]   - So, if you're interested, go check that site out.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.580]   We'll see what's there.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.860]   If you want to spend a lot of money
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.820]   on a retailer that's not there, shoot me an email
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.940]   because I'm intentionally not putting
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.500]   every retailer that you have.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.460]   This episode is brought to you by Viore,
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.300]   which is amazing because they are one of only
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.220]   the few brands I wear almost every single day.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.700]   I've got a shirt on, I've got the core shorts on.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.740]   I love Viore and I love that they bring a new perspective
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.100]   on performance apparel.
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.180]   It's so versatile.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.180]   It can be used for just about any activity,
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.420]   whether it's running, training, swimming, yoga,
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:46.020]   or even lounging or running errands or going out to dinner.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.420]   Seriously, I wear my MetaPants out for dinner all the time.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.700]   But today I want to talk about their Dreamknit collection
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.020]   because it's amazing.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.040]   It is super soft, lightweight, moisture wicking,
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.180]   but also has this amazing four-way performance stretch
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.820]   that makes it so comfortable.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.300]   While it's almost impossible to narrow
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.740]   my Viore recommendations down to just one thing,
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.540]   I want you to check out the Ponto Performance Jogger for Men
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.300]   or the Performance Jogger for Women.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.060]   I know me and my wife, Amy, absolutely love them
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.500]   and wear them all the time.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.380]   Seriously, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.540]   And for everyone watching,

[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.540]   This episode is brought to you by Element.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.100]   Now, I love Element and I use it all the time
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.400]   because it helps anyone stay hydrated
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.060]   without the sugar and other dodgy ingredients
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.580]   in popular electrolyte and sports drinks.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.920]   And that's important because electrolyte deficiency
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.520]   or imbalance can cause headaches, cramps, fatigue,
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.380]   brain fog, and weakness.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.700]   In fact, Element is a zero sugar electrolyte drink mix
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.860]   and sparkling electrolyte water
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.920]   born from the growing body of research
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.740]   revealing that optimal health outcomes
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.060]   occur at sodium levels
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.740]   two to three times government recommendations.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.620]   Element is formulated for anyone
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.380]   on a mission to restore their health through hydration
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.180]   and is perfectly suited for everyone from athletes
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.020]   to regular people like me
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.740]   and works if you're fasting on a keto, low carb,
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.140]   or paleo diet.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.360]   And if you're not sure if it's for you, don't worry
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.500]   because Element offers a no questions asked refund policy

[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.300]   How many different brands of gift cards
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.940]   in a given period of time do you have in your inventory?
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.700]   - We think about things in terms of like SKUs,
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.280]   which would be like a brand plus a denomination.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.260]   And we have over 200 SKUs in stock typically.
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.920]   Our inventory is like, I guess, eight figures.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.620]   It's a huge inventory, amount of inventory to manage,
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.480]   which is also why it's very hard if somebody is like,
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.860]   I want to buy a $100 Starbucks gift card.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.620]   I don't wanna be rude, but it's also like,
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.460]   yeah, I'm gonna make like $2 on that
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.560]   and it's gonna take like 20 minutes to do the accounting.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.980]   So like it's just the economics don't make sense for that.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.340]   - I mean, I found the same thing,
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.900]   which is why I kind of told everyone
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.620]   that the minimum order was $1,000 worth of gift card value
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:38.140]   to make it worth my time, which still depends
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.860]   because I'm not holding inventory.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.540]   My risk is on the positive,
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.140]   my benefit is I'm not holding inventory.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.220]   You've learned how to manage that.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:46.140]   I'm not ready for that.
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.700]   The downside is this market changes a lot.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.960]   And so I imagine that the week that Uber is 25% off at Costco
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.940]   I could probably get better deal on Uber gift cards
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.980]   than the week that Costco takes it off
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.200]   and it hasn't been there.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:02.740]   And so when I'm doing this, I'm taking on some risk.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.020]   And there was one right now that I'm looking at
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.380]   where I sold some gift cards in a brand
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:10.380]   and those gift cards are now not available
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.980]   for the price that they were.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.540]   And so I might lose a little bit, but that's okay.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.420]   I made the commitment that I would do that sale
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.620]   and that's okay, that's my risk.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.540]   But for you, how often are these prices changing
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.300]   and how much fluctuation from Black Friday
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.820]   when there's all these deals throughout the year
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.620]   is the range of a Amazon gift card?
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.980]   How much swing is there?
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.180]   - That's a good example of a fairly
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.580]   like long-term volatile brand
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.900]   in that it was unheard of to see Amazon on raise
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.200]   for even 1% off.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.660]   And we're talking like really almost no discount.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.980]   But then the pepper effect of them entering the marketplace,
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.980]   selling tons of Amazon gift cards at a huge discount
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.680]   is that at the time of recording, if you went to raise,
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.980]   it would be like 8.5% off for Amazon.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.900]   That's a crazy discount for a place
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:58.740]   that just sells everything.
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:01.100]   Like my personal Amazon account is like loaded
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.340]   to the gills with gift cards.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.780]   It's never been that cheap before.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.780]   For other brands that are lower volume,
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.020]   you can see a lot more volatility even in the short term.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:15.820]   So Chipotle, for example, is one where like
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.460]   it can fluctuate between,
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.620]   in terms of the deals that you could buy at a store,
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.860]   it'll fluctuate between like 10 and 20% off.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.820]   So markets can move fairly quickly.
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.280]   I'm a huge economics nerd.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.700]   Most markets in the world that you can access in the US
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.380]   are like mature and well-developed.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.420]   So like the stock market, the commodities
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.340]   and futures exchange, things like that.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.380]   People much smarter than me
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.140]   with much faster computers than me,
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.780]   those problems are all solved.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.220]   This is like a market where it is like the wild west
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.860]   and like, you know, things happen, things move quickly
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.380]   and it's a really undeveloped market.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.460]   And so it's very exciting and very fun for me,
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.020]   like on the economic side of things,
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.060]   'cause we've been in business for over five years now.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.820]   So we have all this data about how prices move,
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.420]   how price affects daily sales, things like that.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.180]   So we're able to make educated guesses
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.460]   as to where the market's gonna go
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.060]   based on what effect the sale is gonna have.
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.700]   And so the part of this job that's really exciting to me
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.020]   is less like delivering gift cards to someone
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.140]   and more of that market stuff
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.420]   and like trying to guess the volatility,
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.100]   trying to not get in trouble
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.460]   when you bought a bunch of Southwest gift cards
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:24.700]   and now they're 5% cheaper.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.860]   So yeah, I mean, things can definitely move,
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.780]   you know, things can move 5% overnight, no problem.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:33.140]   And so it's important that you size your bets appropriately
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.220]   to account for that kind of volatility.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.100]   - Yeah, the data you have is something that,
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.020]   you know, I wish I had,
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:41.300]   because every now and then I'll see a wild deal
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.060]   and I'm like, how much of this should I buy?
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.980]   And when it's just for me, you know, my wife and I,
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.660]   when Costco had Southwest gift cards
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.100]   and they, you know, increased the bonus
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.380]   and it was like 50, I can't remember what,
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.340]   maybe it got up to 16%.
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.860]   I was like, well, how much are we gonna spend in Southwest?
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:57.860]   They don't expire.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.580]   Like how much do we spend flying Southwest
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.260]   over the next three or four years?
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.140]   And I guess one alternative thing to keep in mind is
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.700]   while gift cards probably do fluctuate in value,
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.220]   they're definitely not earning interest.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.860]   So if you're gonna buy 25 years
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.700]   of your Southwest Airlines budget, you know,
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.260]   there's some window at which you probably
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.340]   would have been better off putting that money to work,
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.460]   whether it's a savings account or some type of investment
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.300]   and not investing in gift cards,
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.300]   even if, you know, those prices do fluctuate.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.260]   But like you, I realized at some point,
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.060]   I was like, oh, wow, sometimes these are a lot cheaper.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.620]   And there are definitely a few gift cards that I bought
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.700]   and then realized, oh, I could have gotten
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.980]   an even better deal and I kind of lost a little.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.140]   Now these weren't major bets, but with that data,
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.860]   it would be interesting to say, gosh,
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.740]   if Amazon's at an all-time high discount,
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.260]   should I just buy a ton of Amazon and hold onto it?
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.380]   And I think that's a little bit
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.220]   of what you're doing right now
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.220]   because it's never been this good.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.060]   - Yeah, it was the day after Christmas, maybe.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.300]   Pepper, I wanna say had it for 20% back in coins.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:03.420]   And I'm not proud of it 'cause I was like hanging out
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.740]   with my family and my nieces and nephews and stuff,
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:09.420]   but I was like, I mean, I gotta buy some of this.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.060]   'Cause like, that's a crazy deal.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.380]   Like when's Amazon gonna be 20% back?
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.740]   But fortunately, it only takes a couple minutes
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.900]   to buy something on Pepper, but.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.260]   - Yeah, and that deal did not last.
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.980]   I haven't seen it at that price.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.620]   And just for people who are looking at their Pepper app
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.180]   seeing, you know, 5% or 8% or nothing,
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.420]   it seems that, you know, some of the people
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.260]   who are doing a lot of spending on that app
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.340]   are seeing different deals than other people.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.060]   And a lot of those have come down.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.380]   And by the time this gets published,
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.740]   who knows if any of those deals are around
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.220]   and the fate of Pepper is very unclear.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.460]   But it sounds like things are kind of pretty volatile.
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.460]   Between now, let's say this comes out
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.820]   at end of January, early February,
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.420]   are there periods of time over the next two or three months
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.020]   that, you know, are for whatever reason
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.220]   often filled with great deals?
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.580]   - Not really.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.500]   So we're kind of in a slow part of the year.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.620]   Everyone kind of has a hangover after Christmas
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.460]   in terms of retail.
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:07.540]   People spend a ton of money buying Christmas presents
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.980]   and then, you know, maybe they get gift cards for Christmas
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:12.340]   and then they buy stuff right after Christmas.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.820]   And then everything is really slow
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.420]   until more or less Mother's Day.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.460]   Things have been busier than usual this year for January.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.900]   But one reason I just got back from vacation yesterday,
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.540]   I always book a vacation in January
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:26.260]   because I'm working nonstop October through Christmas.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.940]   So usually I finally get to take a break,
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.420]   but things have actually been surprisingly busy.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.180]   We're kind of in uncharted waters
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.500]   in terms of how busy it is now.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:38.060]   So I hesitate to speculate what February would look like.
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.020]   - And one thing I didn't ask,
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.340]   are there some retailers that are just never on sale?
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:42.460]   You can never get a deal?
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.100]   And maybe never say never
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.660]   'cause you thought that way about Amazon.
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.980]   But, you know, I tend to think
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.740]   that almost everywhere you can buy an Apple laptop
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.580]   seems to never go 20% off.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:55.620]   It was kind of my mental radar,
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:59.940]   but things like Target and Best Buy and Home Depot,
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.980]   I never really see crazy deals for those gift cards.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.660]   - In terms of a place that is never on sale,
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.180]   the one that comes to mind is Costco.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:13.020]   Costco cards are treated same as cash.
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.940]   In fact, if you don't have a membership
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.060]   and you use a Costco card,
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.660]   I believe they cash the card out at the register.
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:20.300]   So obviously it would be a real coot
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:23.620]   if you could buy Costco gift cards at a discount.
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.380]   You also, as an exception to what we discussed earlier,
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:31.540]   you can use Costco cash gift cards to buy other gift cards.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.900]   But because they're effectively the same as cash,
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.700]   I think that's why I've never seen them on sale
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.260]   anywhere other than Costco.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.980]   I've never seen them on sale at a discount.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.300]   They're kind of unique in that way.
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.820]   I mean, even Amazon,
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:47.180]   even before Pepper started going crazy with Amazon,
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.220]   we could still get it from Kroger
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.060]   from the fuel point steals.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.220]   So basically if a place sells their gift cards
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.660]   in a store that other than their own,
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.220]   there's usually an angle
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.740]   to get those gift cards at a discount.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.100]   And that may even be in the form of card linked offers.
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.100]   So I mentioned Tory Burch.
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.420]   You're never gonna see a Tory Burch gift card on sale,
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.460]   even at full price at your grocery store.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.580]   But with a card linked offer, you can make it work.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.300]   And then also if you see a card linked offer
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.220]   at a place like a Lowe's Home Improvement,
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.700]   they sell third-party gift cards.
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.100]   And so anything that's on their rack,
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.660]   if you've got an offer that's like spend 200, say 50,
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.220]   you could buy Apple gift cards at Lowe's.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.220]   And that would be an angle to do that as well.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.740]   - Okay, I just asked 'cause I never seemed
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:34.500]   to see Apple gift cards at a major discount.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.860]   It seems like that's one of the retailers
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:41.420]   that always is selling at or close to face value.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:43.460]   - Yeah, Apple and Best Buy,
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.660]   on like the wholesale side of things,
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:48.260]   they tend to not dip below like 90%.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.500]   And so the discount that you would see as a customer,
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:51.860]   if you're buying it with a credit card,
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.940]   is gonna be pretty close to full price.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.820]   - So I'm curious,
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.500]   how do a lot of these brands feel about this?
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.380]   Are there brands that get mad
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.340]   if their gift cards are listed on Raise?
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.660]   And are they upset
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.100]   if people are selling their cards at a discount?
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.580]   Obviously, Amazon's not intending
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.540]   for Amazon gift cards to be available.
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:10.900]   I don't wanna promise anything,
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.700]   but as of now, the gift card site I set up,
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.700]   we're able to sell Amazon at 10% off.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.420]   And there's probably a reason
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:21.900]   that that's been 80% of all the order volume
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.380]   for the gift card site I set up
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.620]   has been through Amazon getting 10% off.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.100]   Is Amazon unhappy about that?
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.820]   Like, should I worry that they're gonna be like
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.540]   angry at me for doing this?
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.500]   - I think that the general retailer approach
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.700]   ranges from indifference to outright hostility.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.380]   The places that are really hostile,
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:43.060]   you'll see their gift cards can't be purchased on Raise.
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.660]   So Fanatix comes to mind.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.820]   We never buy Fanatix
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.780]   because nobody wants to buy Fanatix
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.540]   because you can't resell Fanatix.
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:55.020]   Amazon is not thrilled
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.060]   if people are using the gift cards to like drop ship.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.460]   They're not thrilled about that.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.380]   And so they view that as an angle for that to occur,
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:04.660]   but they're not so mad about it
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.300]   that they banned them from Raise.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.380]   And so a good rule of thumb is if you go to raise.com
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.940]   and it's a brand you've heard of before
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:12.660]   and the page doesn't exist
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.700]   or there's no gift cards for sale,
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:18.700]   that likely means that they sent an angry letter to Raise.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.140]   - So before you buy a gift card
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.620]   thinking you're gonna profit off its resale,
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.180]   just check if Raise is selling it.
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:26.020]   And if not, it might be a lot harder
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.940]   than you think to flip that gift card.
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:29.780]   - For sure, yeah.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.380]   And if you're planning to do this as a business,
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.020]   definitely don't buy a gift card
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:37.180]   until you know that you've got a buyer lined up for it.
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:40.540]   Unless it's at a place where you're comfortable
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.620]   consuming whatever it is that they sell.
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:45.500]   But yeah, if you buy a bunch of Fanatix
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.620]   and you're not a sports fan,
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:48.340]   like you're gonna have a tough time
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.580]   'cause nobody's gonna want that.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.420]   - Yeah.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:54.740]   And as an amateur person thinking of this as a side hustle,
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.780]   obviously they can come to you to sell gift cards.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.580]   I know you can sell gift cards on Raise,
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:03.180]   but is that kind of a losing proposition for the seller
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.740]   if they're doing it at small volume?
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.860]   - Yeah, I think the commission that Raise charges,
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:11.620]   obviously the more that you sell, the higher volume,
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:14.180]   the better the rates get.
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.660]   And so we have better rates
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.300]   than you would get coming in off the street for sure.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.180]   I think that you would have a hard time
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.260]   just with the rack rate,
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:24.500]   making money selling a couple of gift cards a month.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.220]   If what you have is that Starbucks gift card
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.420]   that you didn't want,
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.940]   well, getting something is better than nothing.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.660]   And so if Raise's commission
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.780]   is like 12 and a half percent or something like that,
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.820]   if you're coming in off the street,
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.740]   then maybe that's better than having a gift card
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.140]   that you're not gonna use,
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.020]   but you're gonna have a hard time making a profit
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:44.380]   reselling stuff on Raise.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.060]   Another challenge is you're gonna be competing
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:49.540]   against people like me who are professionally doing this,
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:51.460]   who have the data and the software needed
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.500]   to genuinely compete on the market.
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.300]   It would be a little naive to go in
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.860]   with just a few gift cards
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.900]   and think that you're gonna come out ahead, right?
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:02.820]   - You are the place that I've sold the most gift cards,
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.820]   the place I've bought the most gift cards from.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.380]   If someone's looking to get into this,
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.380]   obviously Raise might not be the best
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:11.780]   as you're just getting started outside of you guys.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.380]   If you guys aren't buying a card
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.820]   that someone's looking to buy,
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.940]   are there any other places that you'd throw out there
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:18.660]   for them to look at?
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.780]   - Well, if we don't buy the card,
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:24.340]   the odds are quite good that no one wants the card.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.660]   We'll flip anything that we can find.
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.140]   We're even hoping to flip some things
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.660]   that aren't gift cards in the near future.
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.260]   Like if we can make a market, we'll make a market for it.
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:34.620]   And so it's unusual for there to be a brand
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.980]   that we won't buy, but that other people will buy.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.220]   That said, we do have competitors.
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:42.820]   You could list directly on Raise.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.340]   There are other middlemen like us.
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.140]   So Card Center is one.
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.620]   Now, bear in mind that I do this professionally.
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.820]   So like I haven't sold to Card Center,
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.420]   so I'm not super familiar with how their website works.
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.900]   You're probably more of an expert than I am
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.380]   in terms of like what the experience is like.
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:03.300]   Gift Card Wiki is another competitor, as is The Card Bay.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.380]   I've used Gift Card Wiki.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:07.500]   That's actually like kind of what got me
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.420]   into this hobby a decade ago.
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:11.580]   And we built our site because we wanted to solve
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.620]   a lot of the pain points,
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.140]   a lot of the things that we didn't like selling
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:14.980]   to other people.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.500]   And I genuinely like our product.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.580]   I think that we have an excellent product.
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.620]   I'm proud of our product.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:23.380]   And we care a lot about constantly improving the experience.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:24.980]   So if someone else comes out with a feature
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.180]   that we didn't think of,
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.940]   we will shamelessly copy that feature
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.660]   because we wanna be the best place to sell gift cards.
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.340]   - Since you guys are doing seven, eight figures
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:36.900]   of gift card transactions, I'm curious,
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:40.780]   what do you think really separates the top sellers
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:42.900]   from the average person looking for deals
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:46.780]   and trying to start up a side hustle in gift card reselling?
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.180]   - In most industries, and ours is no exception,
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:51.700]   a small percentage of people provide us
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.740]   the vast majority of our inventory, right?
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.780]   So like kind of like an 80/20 thing, right?
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.300]   Where it's like fifth of our users
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.860]   provide four fifths of the cards.
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:02.300]   So the thing that separates those people
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:05.500]   is those people tend to work full time on it
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:06.340]   when there's a good deal.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.420]   There's the make hay while the sun shines,
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:09.820]   like when there's a good deal.
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.860]   Those tend to be people who can,
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.900]   they either have flexible work
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.100]   or like they don't work full time.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.700]   They can work full time when there's a great gift card deal.
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:24.100]   So I mentioned how Rob was able to do so much in one week.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.060]   That's because Rob is a professional poker player
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:32.060]   and his job is playing poker at night here in Texas
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.860]   where it's legal to do so.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.500]   And when there's a good gift card deal
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.580]   that will pay him more per hour than that work,
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:40.740]   then he's able, he's flexible.
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.900]   No, he doesn't have to clock in at the poker room, right?
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.780]   He can just not play poker for a week, that's no problem.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:48.500]   So the people that are really delivering tons of cards
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.860]   tend to be people that have more flexible work like that.
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:54.780]   I mean, we have plenty of people who are top quartile
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.300]   who have full-time jobs on top of it.
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:00.220]   Those people are just willing to do a lot of work, I guess.
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.660]   - So obviously not everyone's gonna get
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:02.940]   to Rob's level right away.
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.060]   So for someone who's just getting started
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.380]   and thinking this is interesting,
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.260]   what do you think the best way to get started is?
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.860]   Is it to sign up and sell their first gift card to you?
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.860]   - Sure, we talked about Costco earlier.
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:19.860]   If I had to pick one place to start that is easy and safe
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:24.260]   and you should make a profit outright from the get-go,
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:26.780]   it would be Costco and even Costco.com.
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.100]   I believe that we're paying,
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.940]   I think you can make a profit on both Instacart
[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:34.060]   and Uber gift cards, selling them to us right now.
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:35.500]   If you buy them from Costco.com,
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.580]   you're not even leaving your house,
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:39.180]   you're just getting an email, you're copying a number,
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.500]   pasting it onto our site.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.740]   So yeah, if you're looking to get started,
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:43.580]   I would start there.
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:44.420]   And if something goes wrong,
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:47.060]   Costco famously has terrific customer support.
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.260]   That or whether you're gonna keep it or sell it,
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:50.500]   I mean, what you mentioned with Pepper
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.700]   is another great place to start.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:55.660]   - I do think that Pepper would probably be a good place
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:58.220]   to start to get a deal for yourself,
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.780]   but, and maybe a good place to start
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.260]   using a card-linked offer and a new user promo.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:07.380]   I'll throw caution to anyone who's never signed up
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.220]   to get the rates that are gonna make
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.340]   a profitable reselling business.
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.700]   You're not gonna see those out the gate.
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.060]   And so if you look in there and say,
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.260]   "Gosh, I could buy this on Pepper.
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.860]   How much can I sell it to Aligned Incentives for?"
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:19.500]   You're probably not gonna make money there.
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.700]   But for some of these grocery store deals,
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.380]   these card-linked offer deals,
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.380]   the deals you talked about at Costco,
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:28.060]   like those might make a profit from a get-go.
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:30.420]   And that's just the profit of the business.
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:31.900]   We didn't talk at all about the fact
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.420]   that you get your 2% for executive rewards,
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.540]   if you have executive rewards at Costco.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:38.300]   And depending on your payment method,
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.300]   if you're paying with a credit card,
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.980]   you might get rewards there.
[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:44.500]   And so you can decide based on all the different factors,
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.940]   what kind of margin you need from reselling.
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.380]   But I've been very surprised
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:51.540]   that this can be a profitable business,
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.940]   buying and selling gift cards,
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.260]   buying them when there's deals.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.180]   I haven't been a rob yet.
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:56.100]   I haven't flown around.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.900]   I haven't hit the in-store stuff hard,
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.700]   but you guys do a lot of alerts on the site
[00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:03.780]   in the Telegram channel and that kind of stuff.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:05.940]   And I think if people stay on top of those,
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:08.060]   when there's a deal, it's pretty clear there's a deal
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.140]   and you can jump on it and make money.
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:11.820]   - Yeah, and we take all types.
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:14.380]   I mean, there's tons of people who've never,
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.620]   never gotten a check from us for more than $1,000.
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:18.460]   And that's fine too.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.260]   And they're just like doing little bits every week,
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.500]   whenever they have time.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:23.140]   You don't have to be at Rob's level
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.380]   to get something out of this.
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.500]   And even if you're like my friend,
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.380]   who's never sold me any gift cards,
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:30.220]   and he just uses the gift cards himself, that's great too.
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.220]   The main takeaway here is that,
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.500]   gift cards are not just for gifting.
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:36.540]   Like they are a way to save money on stuff.
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.380]   And whether that is saving money for yourself
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.260]   or even reselling them and making a profit,
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:42.980]   they're more than just a type of payment rail.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.020]   - To go back to where we started,
[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:46.180]   if I were listening to this
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:47.940]   and I haven't gone through the process
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.660]   of looking at where I spend money
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:51.660]   and looking at how much impact it would have
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:54.500]   to save 10 to 20% on it like you,
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:55.820]   that'd be a fun place to start.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:57.660]   Go look at where you spent your money last year.
[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.180]   And for every one of those, look it up on Raise,
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.780]   look and get a sense of what the scope is.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.020]   Now, do I think if you come to the site I built,
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.740]   you can beat what Raise is offering?
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.820]   Yeah, I think that.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.820]   Do I think if you put in the work
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.980]   to go find those gift cards yourself during deal times,
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:15.740]   you can even beat rates on my site, rates on Raise?
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.580]   Yeah, so I think there's a lot of opportunity to save money
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.460]   if you know where you spend money
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.620]   and you could turn this into a business as well.
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.300]   I'll put links to Aligned Incentives in the show notes
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.620]   and we'll put links to everything we talked about.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.220]   Logan, thanks for doing business with me.
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.020]   I've enjoyed working together.
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.020]   - I've enjoyed working together.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.560]   - Thanks for having me on, man.
