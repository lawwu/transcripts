[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.220]   The following clip is taken from John Piper's sermon, "The Tragic Cost of Her
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.940]   Cavernous Thirst," preached on June 21st, 2009, a sermon on the text where Jesus
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.280]   meets the woman at the well in John 4, verses 16 to 26. Here's what Pastor John
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:28.040]   had to say. "Some kind of bondage and slavery that drives her. Now she is
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.760]   locked and he's gonna move in. He can move in by showing her, 'You are thirsty.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.320]   You are so thirsty. Wake up! Wake up! You think it's all about men. You think it's
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120]   all about romance. You think it's all about being embraced and held. You think
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.600]   it's all about having security. It's not about any of that. It's about me. It's
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:06.120]   about water and not sexually with me. Me, Messiah, Savior, Prophet, water. Your soul,
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:16.680]   your soul is made to drink deep, deep, deep satisfaction from Jesus. And if you're
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:25.400]   not, I know what you're doing. You're into a serial routine. Probably for most of
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:37.480]   you it's not sex. Some of you it is for sure. Just jumping from bed to bed. Think
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:46.560]   that's it? It goes so deep, just in the moment it's so, it's so water, so lye, and
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.320]   you know it the next morning. And you get harder and harder. We're learning about
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.680]   Jesus here. Compassion, aggressive, surgical, relentless love, knows
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.360]   everything about us. Isn't it good to be known? Painful as all get-out and good to
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.520]   be known by somebody. This kind of person anyway. He knows everything about you.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.080]   Absolutely everything. Kinky stuff, he knows. Hidden stuff from your youth, he
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.600]   knows. Financial stuff, he knows. Thoughts, he knows. Feelings, he knows. Midnight
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.360]   stuff, he knows. He knows you completely. And he's the most important person in the
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.120]   universe. Do you know yourself? You're meeting yourself in this woman. The
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:44.120]   thirsts. One of the evidences that we are not drinking Jesus, either because you're
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.600]   an unbeliever and you've never even tasted, or because you're a believer and
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.520]   something has begun to lure you to another fountain, starting to go there, or
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   you've just blocked him out because you've got some hidden thing you want to
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.880]   keep doing or whatever. One of the evidences of not drinking deeply from
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.040]   Jesus is the instability of constantly moving from one thing to the next,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.880]   seeking to fill the void. You may be going through sexual partners. You may be
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.200]   going through friends. You may be going through jobs. You may be going through
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.760]   churches. Just one after the other. You may be going through hobbies, internet
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.720]   stuff, hobbies, games. You may be going through hairstyles. You may be going
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.440]   through wardrobes. You may be going through cars. You may be going through
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:57.320]   locations of where you live because there's no deeply contented identity in
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:06.200]   Christ. Deeply contented. Deeply satisfied. That's what water means. Living water is
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.000]   your soul is a cavern of desire. And I offer myself to you, Jesus says, as water
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.760]   that lives. It becomes a well. It just satisfies day after day. You get up with
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.920]   hungers and longings and soul achings in the morning. Come to me and you'll find
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:32.120]   stability of contented identity. And then you don't move around so much. Jump in
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.840]   here, jump in there, jump in here, jump in there. Crave, crave, crave, crave, crave,
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:44.440]   crave. Nothing's working. Oh, don't you love people who are so deep with Jesus
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.800]   they know where it's at. The water. They live by the fountain. They never go
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.840]   anywhere. They just live there. They're not jumping from job to job and wife to
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.440]   wife and girlfriend to girlfriend and car to car and hairstyle to hairstyle.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.160]   They are so there. Here's the interesting thing about that. That sounds static,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.440]   doesn't it? Baloney! It isn't static. Believe me, it isn't static. I don't mean
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.280]   that the Christian life with that kind of centered, deep, satisfied identity by
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.720]   the fountain, satisfied day after day, freshly with new water coming up from
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.360]   this friendship and this relationship, I do not mean this is static. There is
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.720]   a difference between confident movement of faith and craving movement of
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.520]   frustration. You got that? There is a difference between confident movement in
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.200]   faith and craving movement of frustration. "Got to move because this is not working.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:59.320]   Here, move, move, move." Or, "This is so working, I'm taking it. I got a plan. I'm making
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.600]   something of my life. I'm not wasting it. I am moving to China. I'm moving to
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.000]   Ukraine. I'm moving to Southeast Asia. I am on the way because I got my feet on a
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.560]   rock and there's a fountain coming up out of this rock and it goes with me
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.640]   everywhere. It's Jesus, not any geographical location. So don't don't hear me say that
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.360]   the movement in life, you know, job to job and hairstyle to hairstyle and wife to
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.240]   wife and sex to sex and TV program to TV program, that the alternative is frozen.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.360]   I got the fountain. You know that's not what I'm talking about. This fountain is
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   really a moving fountain. It's like a waterfall. I've used that analogy before.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:47.680]   Stay under it, it moves. Oh Jesus is a mover. He's gonna reach the nations. The
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.160]   fountain's on its way to the nations. You want to get drink deepest, go with him to
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.480]   the nations or the neighborhood. Magnificent, rich truth. That clip was
