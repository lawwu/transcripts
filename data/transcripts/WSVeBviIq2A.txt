[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:13.240]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, verses 26 and 33.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:22.360]   John answered them, saying, "I baptized with water, but there standeth one among you
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:30.120]   whom ye know not, and I knew him not; but he that sent me to baptize with water, the
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.800]   same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.080]   the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.400]   Now we've been considering this great statement, this tremendous doctrine concerning the baptism
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.840]   with the Holy Ghost for some time, for many months, and we've arrived at the point at
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.400]   which we are now considering the relationship of this term to certain other terms that are
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.960]   used in the New Testament with regard to the operations of the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.360]   I do this for a number of reasons.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.240]   One is that it's important that we should be clear in our minds, even with regard to
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.000]   terms and terminology.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.200]   And secondly, I do that all the more because I'm often asked to explain the relationship
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.680]   between the baptism with the Holy Ghost and sanctification, or the sealing of the Spirit
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.480]   and the earnest of the Spirit, the unction of the Spirit, and so on.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.320]   Those of you who are familiar with your Bibles, as I trust you all are, will know that these
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.760]   are different terms that are used in describing the operations of the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.520]   And they are used, of course, as analogies and illustrations in order to help us to lay
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.960]   hold upon the truth.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.920]   Now last Sunday morning we were considering the relationship between the baptism with
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.480]   the Spirit and sanctification, and we came to the conclusion that the connection between
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.440]   the two is not so much direct as indirect.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.440]   You mustn't identify them, but you mustn't separate them altogether either, because,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.720]   obviously, all the operations of the Spirit are interrelated.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:36.240]   They are His operations, and therefore each one tends to produce a certain amount of effect
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.880]   with regard to the action and the operation of the other.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.640]   So we decided that the connection between the baptism of the Spirit and sanctification
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.240]   is this indirect association, that the baptism of the Spirit is obviously one of the greatest
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.280]   stimuli to sanctification conceivable.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.040]   So it is indicated in the Scripture, and so it has been found to be in the experience
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.400]   of God's people throughout the centuries.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.440]   Well now, we come this morning to another term which is used with respect to the Holy
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.120]   Spirit, and that is the sealing of the Spirit.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.360]   Here is a term that you find in particular in the second epistle to the Corinthians in
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.040]   the first chapter, towards the end of the first chapter, in verse 22, the apostle puts
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.240]   it like this, he says, "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him are men,
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.040]   and to the glory of God by us.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.320]   Now he which establisheth us with you in Christ and hath anointed us," there's another of
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:56.800]   the terms, "and hath anointed us is God, who hath also sealed us and given us the earnest
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   of the Spirit in our hearts."
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.000]   There's one use of it.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.800]   Then another one we found in the reading at the beginning, Ephesians 1, 13, "in whom
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.160]   ye also trusted," the apostle is here referring to the Gentiles.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.760]   He has said in verse 11, "in whom also we have obtained an inheritance," that's a
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.440]   reference to the Jews.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.840]   They were the first, as he says, who first trusted in Christ, in verse 12.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.080]   Now then, he says, "in whom you also," the Gentiles, "trusted, after that you heard
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.520]   the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after that ye believed ye were
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.040]   sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.440]   redemption of the purchased position, and to the praise of his glory."
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.440]   And you've got it again in Ephesians 4, 30.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:02.840]   He says, "and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby by whom you are sealed unto
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.800]   the day of redemption."
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.640]   Now those are the main uses of this term.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.840]   There are others which are not quite as explicit as that, but that's sufficient for our purpose
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.280]   this morning.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:25.000]   And what we are told is, you see, that these believers have been sealed, and they have
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.120]   been sealed by the Holy Spirit that was promised, the Holy Spirit of promise.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.080]   The Holy Spirit is often referred to in the New Testament as the promise of the Father.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.240]   There's a great promise running through the Old Testament, of a day which is to come
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.520]   when the Spirit will be poured out upon all flesh.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.640]   You remember the prophecy of Joel, you've got it in Ezekiel 36.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.160]   It's in many other places, in most beautiful and pictorial language quite often, comparing
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.640]   it to the dew or a shower of rain coming, and so on.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.880]   Now therefore, the Holy Spirit in this way is referred to as the Holy Spirit of promise,
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.400]   the promise Holy Spirit.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.840]   And what the apostle teaches is that we are sealed on to the day of redemption by the
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.680]   giving and the receiving of this Holy Spirit so long promised.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.600]   But now the question arises immediately, what is the relationship of this to the baptism
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.320]   of the Spirit, and what exactly this sealing means?
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.400]   Now it seems to me the best way is to take those questions in the reverse order, by discovering
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.120]   what exactly the sealing is, we shall see what its relationship is to the baptism with
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.840]   the Holy Ghost.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.040]   What is this sealing with the Spirit?
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.920]   What does the apostle mean when he reminds the Corinthians and the Ephesians like that?
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.200]   And what he says to them, of course, is true of all other Christians, that they have been
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.320]   sealed with this Holy Spirit of promise.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:17.040]   Well now, the tendency again on the part of some is to identify this also with sanctification.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.760]   There is a teaching, it's been the prevailing and the most popular teaching in evangelical
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:31.120]   circles ever since about 1873, that all these terms really are just different ways of describing
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.520]   sanctification.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.040]   And that when we are told therefore that we have been sealed by the Spirit, it is just
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:46.640]   another way of saying that we all are undergoing this process of sanctification, and that all
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:55.480]   the promises of God are sealed to us by producing the fruits of sanctification in us.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.680]   And that therefore the sealing of the Spirit means that we are manifesting love, joy, peace,
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:08.120]   long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, meekness, faith, and temperance, the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:16.320]   In other words, you see, the teaching is that there is nothing special or separate or unique
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   about the sealing with the Spirit.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.320]   Now I indicated last Sunday in dealing with the question of sanctification that there
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.000]   are people who take that same view with regard to that.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.560]   And then there were the others, of course, who identified the baptism with sanctification.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.140]   So again, it's necessary that we should clear this matter.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.440]   And I want to suggest to you this morning that this identification of the sealing with
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:51.920]   the Spirit, with the baptism with the Spirit, is again nothing but confusion, and it becomes
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.760]   important and serious, because I believe that eventually it leads to a quenching of the
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.400]   Spirit, that men and women coming to the conclusion that all that is meant here is that because
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.560]   we are born again and have got the seed of life in us which is growing, our sanctification
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.480]   is proceeding, that's the work of the Holy Spirit, and therefore—well, that is what
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.360]   is meant by saying that we are sealed, and therefore they look for nothing further.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.960]   Now this is the danger, it seems to me, all along the line with this question.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:30.400]   It is the danger of reducing the New Testament terminology to the level of our own experiences.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:37.800]   It is the danger of interpreting the New Testament teaching not in terms of the life of the early
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:45.560]   Church, but the life of the Church as it has become, unfortunately, during the centuries.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:51.660]   Or, if you like it in another way, it is the danger of interpreting New Testament teaching
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.520]   in terms of the life of the Church when she is at her lowest, instead of interpreting
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:02.880]   it in terms of the Church when she is at her highest, in periods of revival and quickening
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.400]   and awakening and manifestation of God's glorious power.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.680]   Nothing to me is more serious than this.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.080]   If it is all a matter of sanctification, well then, there is nothing further for us to look
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.080]   for.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.140]   We just go on as we are, yielding ourselves to the work of the Spirit, and you never expect
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:26.500]   anything from outside, you never expect any shower, any outpouring of the Spirit.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:31.600]   And that, of course, is, alas, the prevailing attitude with so many at the present time.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.580]   Now, I am saying all this is wrong.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.440]   On what grounds do I say so?
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:42.760]   Well, I suggest that it is to do violence to the actual words used by the Apostle in
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   the statement in Ephesians 1.13.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.320]   Let us look at this for a moment.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:59.520]   In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.720]   Now I am reading here from the Authorised Version, and it goes on like this.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:11.040]   In whom also, after that ye believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.960]   which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:23.480]   Ah, yes, say these friends who want to identify it with sanctification, I see exactly how
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.640]   you fall into error.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.680]   You have been misled by the Authorised Translation.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.800]   It is always interesting to me to see how these friends seem to think that some special
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.480]   translation is always going to solve the problem.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:42.400]   Well now, of course, we are well aware of the fact that the Authorised Translation here
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.720]   is not literally accurate.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.240]   Now I am emphasizing that.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:53.000]   I am not saying it is not accurate, I am saying it is not literally accurate.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.160]   They should not have actually put "after that ye believed".
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:03.560]   The better translation is "believing" or "having believed".
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.400]   You can take it in both ways.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:11.880]   In whom also believing, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, or in whom having
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.880]   believed.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:20.040]   Now both those translations are correct, and the authorities are divided between the two.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.040]   But you see, this does not make any difference at all to the meaning.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.320]   What the Apostle is saying is this, you also having heard the message of the truth of the
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:36.880]   Gospel, you believed, you received it, and believing or having believed, you were sealed
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:44.000]   with that Holy Spirit of promise, so that it leaves the meaning exactly the same.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.640]   It is presumed and taken for granted that they had believed, they were already believers
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.440]   when they were sealed.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.560]   So if you take it as believing or having believed, instead of "after that ye believed", it comes
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.920]   to exactly the same thing.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.300]   Now I want to quote to you the comment of Charles Hodge at this point, because it seems
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.200]   to me that it cannot be improved upon.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:14.440]   Charles Hodge, referring to this authorised translation, says, "This is more than a translation.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.440]   It is an exposition of the original."
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.960]   And he is undoubtedly right.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.560]   What he means is this, though perhaps they should not have actually said "after that
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.940]   ye believed", they really were expounding the original Greek.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.040]   They translated it like this, they knew all about the exact meaning, these men were great
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.800]   Greek scholars.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.120]   Of course they knew, but they were anxious to help the readers.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.920]   So in order to help, they expound rather than translate at this point.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.240]   He says, "This is more than a translation.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.200]   It is an exposition of the original.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.760]   Whatever is meant by sealing, says Charles Hodge, it is something which follows faith."
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.800]   Now that's the important point.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.320]   It is something which follows faith.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.760]   Or take the words of Charles Simeon with regard to this same statement.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:14.000]   Referring to this sealing of the spirit, he says, "This was vouchsafed to many of the
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   saints at Ephesus."
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.280]   Notice, he doesn't say all of them.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.040]   He says, "This was vouchsafed to many of the saints at Ephesus."
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.440]   And then he goes on.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:30.960]   He says, "There shall always be some in the church who possess and enjoy it."
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.560]   Always some in the church who possess it and enjoy it.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:43.560]   This higher state of sanctification and assurance is reserved for those who, after having believed,
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.680]   have maintained a close walk with God.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:54.080]   In other words, these two authorities, differing so much from one another in many respects,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   Charles Hodge, a great American commentator and theologian, Charles Simeon of Cambridge,
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:08.240]   evangelist, pastor, teacher, they both are agreed about this, that this is something
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:15.440]   that assumes faith, and it is something given to those who possess faith.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:22.160]   And Simeon is particularly insistent upon this point, that it isn't true of all Christians.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.960]   You see, you take that other view which says this is sanctification, and of course you
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.840]   have to say it's true of every Christian, that every Christian has automatically been
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.400]   sealed unto the day of redemption by his very regeneration.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.320]   As they say that the baptism of the Spirit is true of all, that it's the same as regeneration
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.720]   and nothing separate and different, so they say about this.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:48.600]   But here, you see, it seems to me the very words plus what we are told by these authorities
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.480]   make it impossible for us to accept that exposition.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:16:01.920]   In other words, what you've got here in Ephesians 1, 13 is exactly the same order
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.420]   as you have in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.420]   Look at it.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.420]   Look at the apostles themselves.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:13.320]   Here are these men who have been with our Lord and who believed in him, whom he contrasts
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.640]   from the world and of whom he has said, "Now are ye clean through the word which I have
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.080]   spoken unto you?"
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:25.680]   The same men upon whom he had breathed the Holy Spirit in the upper room after his resurrection,
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   the same men whom he told to remain until they received power, these men were already
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.800]   believers, already regenerate.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.200]   But it was only on the day of Pentecost that they were baptized with the Spirit.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   That's the order.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.080]   And you remember the case of the believers down in Samaria.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.280]   Philip had preached, they'd believed the message and he'd baptized them, but still they hadn't
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.480]   been baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.080]   It's the same order.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:56.320]   Then Peter and John come down and pray and lay their hands upon them and the Holy Spirit
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.560]   descends upon them.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   You see the order.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.440]   It's always this order, having believed, believing, then.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.240]   It's precisely a repetition of that.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.560]   And in the same way, you remember in Acts 19, the Apostle Paul having again preached
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.120]   to these people, he then baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, but still
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:21.080]   he had to lay his hands upon them before they received the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.760]   That's the sequence, that's the order.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.360]   And I'm suggesting you've got exactly the same order here in what the Apostle says about
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.400]   sealing to these Ephesians.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   Very well.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.520]   What then does sealing mean?
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.000]   What is this sealing with the Spirit?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.760]   In whom believing ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.440]   Well now, here again is an interesting point.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.120]   And there are those who say, ah yes, a seal.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.120]   What does that mean?
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.240]   Well it always means ownership.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.480]   When a man owns something he puts his seal on it to say this is my property.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.320]   Quite right, people do that.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.200]   It's one of the meanings of the term sealing.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.720]   Others say no, it's more a question of security.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.640]   And that again is quite right.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:18.000]   You tie up a parcel, you're particularly anxious that this should go safely, so you register
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.400]   it and you can't register everything without sealing it.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.360]   You have to seal it first.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.560]   So the idea they say is security.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.280]   And again of course we know that sealing is used in that sense.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.560]   But it's a very dangerous thing just to turn up your dictionary and see the meaning of
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.800]   a word and then apply the first one you come to and say, ah it must be this.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.080]   No, there are many different meanings to sealing.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:45.360]   And there is another meaning which I want to commend to you as being the most appropriate
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.960]   meaning at this point.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:57.280]   Another purpose of sealing is to authenticate or to confirm as genuine and true.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.560]   Now that you do in signing a document, don't you?
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.920]   Put a seal on it.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:08.560]   Now the object of the sealing here is to authenticate this document, to confirm that this is genuine
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.120]   and that this is true.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.480]   And I want to suggest to you that that is the main meaning here.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.520]   It isn't the only one, the other two I think are involved.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:22.760]   But I believe the main object of the sealing is that the thing has been authenticated.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:29.160]   You believed, says Paul, we believed, you believed, and then you were authenticated
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:36.240]   by the Holy Spirit of promise, who is also the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.920]   of the purchased possession.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.680]   Now why do I say that this is the meaning that we should select rather than the others
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.200]   or at any rate give it the greatest prominence?
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.800]   Well I believe the first argument should be this one, that the very context suggests this.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.480]   You see the apostle here is reminding these Ephesians of what they are as Christians.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.400]   That's the whole object of this letter.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:07.560]   So you see he starts off with the great eternal purpose of God and he shows what God's great
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.560]   purpose is.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.200]   His purpose he says is really this, that he has chosen us in him before the foundation
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:18.800]   of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.680]   us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto himself.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.400]   That's what he really is purposing for us.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:32.320]   And so he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.380]   This is the great eternal plan and purpose of God.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:41.560]   As he puts it in verse 10, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:49.360]   in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him,
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.640]   God redeeming the cosmos, making a people for himself.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.960]   And he's done this he says out of the Jews and out of you Gentiles.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.440]   Now what he wants these Ephesians to know is that this is true of them.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.400]   He's writing to encourage them.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.240]   That's why he goes on to pray.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.200]   He says I cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers, praying
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.720]   that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.920]   of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:26.000]   The eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.880]   calling and so on.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.720]   Now that's the context you see.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:37.120]   And even here in this immediate context he says the spirit who is the seal and the earnest
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:43.000]   is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   What's he mean?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Well he means this.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:53.040]   Christ by his work on earth, his life, death and resurrection has purchased for us a great
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   inheritance.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.600]   He's purchased a great estate for us.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.120]   And we are here on earth and life is difficult and we are weak and failing.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:10.080]   The question is how can we know that all this is true, that this inheritance belongs to
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.080]   us.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.040]   He's done the work but we haven't yet possessed it.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:22.320]   It's there and we're going to receive it until the redemption of the purchase possession.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:28.320]   Well he says the security that you were given while you were here is the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.360]   The Holy Spirit is the seal, is the earnest, is birth.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.520]   You've got the title deeds, you've got your document and the stamp is on it and the stamp
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.680]   is this promised Holy Spirit.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.480]   So the stamp has been put upon us.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.920]   We've been sealed by the Spirit.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.120]   Not only as God's possession that comes in.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.680]   Of course I've accepted it but I don't put it first.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.400]   Not only the question of security that is also involved but the greatest thing of all
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:09.240]   is that we might have this authentication and confirmation that this is true of us.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:15.000]   Now then, there's my first argument for this.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.480]   And I would argue that that is the way in which it's used also in the book of the
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.200]   Acts of the Apostles.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:30.480]   As I've reminded you, the Apostles Peter and John had to go down to Samaria.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.480]   What for?
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.680]   Well in a sense to confirm the work that had been done by Philip.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.600]   Philip had preached, they believed, Philip had baptized them.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   All right.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.880]   But still you see that isn't the highest form of authentication.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.800]   So the Apostles go down and they pray for them and lay their hands upon them and the
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.040]   Spirit comes upon them.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:57.080]   There's your authentication to them in particular but also to others who are looking
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.080]   on.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.760]   But of course the most striking case of all in many ways is what happened in the household
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.400]   of Cornelius in the 10th chapter of Acts.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:11.000]   You remember that great story of Peter of the vision and was told to go down with these
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.360]   men who'd come up from Joppa and there he went and he arrived in the household of Cornelius
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.200]   and they were ready to listen to him and he began to preach the gospel.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:29.080]   But we read here in verse 44, "While Peter yet speak these words, the Holy Ghost fell
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.520]   on all them which heard the word.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:38.880]   And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:44.560]   because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.760]   So they heard them speak with tongues and magnified God.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.260]   Then answered Peter, 'Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.060]   have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?'
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.440]   And he commended them to be baptized in the name of the Lord."
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.920]   Well now you see what happened was this.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:07.000]   Peter says, "I was confronted by an unanswerable argument."
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.680]   He was a Jew and he was in trouble.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.920]   He'd been given the vision in order to persuade him that the Gentiles should be admitted into
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.160]   the church.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.680]   He took a vision to persuade him.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.280]   He'd got all the prejudices of a Jew.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.160]   How can the Gentile be a Christian?
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   That was the question.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.160]   And here he is preaching.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.880]   And what Peter is saying in effect is this, "When I saw God putting a seal on these people,
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.840]   who was I to say that they couldn't be received or that they shouldn't be baptized?
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.640]   God," he said, "put their seal upon them."
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.960]   And therefore he says, "I was speechless."
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.000]   And you remember Peter was called to account for this.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.360]   And he had to go up to Jerusalem to explain his action in baptizing these Gentiles and
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.440]   receiving them into the Christian church.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.640]   And in chapter 11 of the Acts you get an account of the meeting.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.440]   He says in verse 15, "And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.440]   beginning.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:09.160]   Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, 'John indeed baptized with water,
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.760]   but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.'
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:17.400]   Not as much then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.280]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.240]   What was I that I could withstand God?
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.840]   Then when they heard these things, they held their peace and glorified God, saying, 'Then
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.480]   hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.'"
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   But you see the argument.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.640]   God had given the evidence.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.880]   God had put his seal upon them.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:45.320]   So I'm arguing that what you've got here in Ephesians 1.13 is in conformity with what
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.720]   you find there described in the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.520]   But come, I have still a stronger piece of evidence to put before you.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:58.040]   And surely this is the thing that should determine us in our decision as to what exactly is meant
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:02.600]   by the sealing with the Spirit.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.280]   And here we turn to what we are told about our blessed Lord himself.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:14.160]   This is in the sixth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.360]   Let me begin to read at verse 25.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:25.520]   This is about the Jews who were not believing in our Lord and who were arguing with him.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:32.000]   When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, 'Rabbi, when came
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.400]   is thou hither?' Jesus answered them and said, 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, you seek
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   me not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:52.520]   Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:57.800]   life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.840]   For him hath God the Father sealed.'
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840]   Exactly the same term.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:14.600]   Here our Lord is saying about himself that he has been sealed by God the Father.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:20.440]   Now you see, this was said to these Jews who didn't believe in him.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.200]   They go on, go on to verse 28.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.000]   Then said they unto him, 'What shall we do that we might work the works of God?'
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.120]   And later they ask him, 'What sign showest thou then that we may see and believe thee?
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.280]   What dost thou work?'
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.800]   They wanted a sign.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.960]   They wanted some seal, some proof that he was the Son of God as he claimed to be.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.520]   He's saying, 'I am the bread of life, I am the water of life,' and so on.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.600]   'I am the light of...'
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.440]   But they say, 'We want some proof.'
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.680]   And he says, 'You have had the proof.'
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.560]   God the Father hath already sealed me.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.360]   For him hath God the Father sealed.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   What does this refer to?
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.080]   Well, there's only one answer to this question.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.800]   It can't be sanctification here, can it?
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.520]   You don't talk about the sanctification of the Son of God.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.600]   Of course you don't.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:17.760]   He was born the Son of God, born filled with the Spirit of God.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.560]   He is God, but he's been sealed, he says.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560]   What's he referring to?
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.760]   There's only one answer to this.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:29.840]   He's referring to what happened to him at his baptism.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.240]   It was there that God authenticated him.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:38.200]   You remember, he insisted that John the Baptist should baptize him.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.080]   And there they are in the Jordan.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:48.200]   The Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove, and as we read in John 1,
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.240]   verse 23, 'it remained on him.'
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:57.040]   And the voice came from heaven saying, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.'
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.600]   Now, that is the sealing.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.160]   This is the authentication.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:06.080]   Jesus of Nazareth, the carpenter, suddenly steps forward, begins to teach, and everybody
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.000]   says, 'Who is this?'
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.280]   God answers the question.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.600]   God seals him.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.960]   God authenticates him.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.160]   He says, 'This is my Son.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.440]   The Spirit is sent upon him.'
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.640]   After that, he begins to do his work.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:23.800]   So you remember, having come back from the temptation in the wilderness, he goes to his
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:29.120]   hometown of Nazareth, enters the synagogue on the Sunday, is handed the scroll, and begins
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.800]   to read out of Isaiah.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   What does he read?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.200]   'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath anointed me to preach the gospel,' and
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   so on.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   He's been sealed.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   He's been set apart.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.120]   God says, 'Here is my messenger.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.120]   Here is my Messiah.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.360]   Here is the one to whom you are to listen.'
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:52.640]   The sealing is the descent of the Holy Ghost upon him, and from there on he is led by the
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.600]   Spirit to be tempted in the wilderness.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.440]   He dies in the power of the Spirit.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.720]   God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him, says John, at the end of the third chapter
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   of his gospel.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.720]   Very well, then.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.520]   Here is obviously the thing that is important.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:11.600]   Now listen to Westcote, Bishop Westcote on this.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.880]   His comment, I think, is a particularly clear one.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:21.920]   He says, 'He was solemnly set apart' – sealing means 'solemnly set apart for the fulfillment
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:29.760]   of a charge, and authenticated by intelligible signs.'
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.080]   This is Westcote.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:37.760]   'Solemnly set apart for the fulfillment of a charge, and authenticated by intelligible
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.800]   signs.'
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.480]   That is what happened there to our Lord.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.280]   That is what happened to Cornelius and his household.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.440]   That is what happened to the Samaritans.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.160]   That is what happened to these people in Ephesus.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.520]   This is what the apostle is saying about them.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.200]   Now you see, this seems to me to settle the thing once and forever.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.760]   The same term is used about our Lord.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.800]   And therefore it is clear that this is not a reference to sanctification.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.160]   This is clearly something that is concerned with witnessing, with power to witness, power
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:18.520]   to testify, something visible, tangible, something that men can understand, intelligible.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.200]   Something has happened.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.320]   And so when you read about our Lord's ministry, you find that people were amazed.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.720]   They said, 'We cannot dispute the power, but after all this is Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.440]   How do you explain these things?'
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.160]   And he keeps on saying to them, 'Can't you see the explanation?
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.400]   What I am doing, what I have been enabled to do, is the proof of who I am and what I
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.920]   am claiming for myself.'
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:45.120]   Up until the age of thirty, our Lord apparently lived a life like everybody else, but suddenly,
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.240]   as he set out upon his work of witness and testimony, he receives this sealing of the
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.680]   Spirit.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:59.240]   In other words, I am suggesting to you that the sealing of the Spirit and the baptism
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.960]   of the Spirit are the same thing.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:08.400]   These terms are synonymous, but they are used one here and one there according to the immediate
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.600]   context.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.680]   When it is purely a question of witness and testimony, you get the term 'baptism' used.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.160]   But when it is put more in terms of our inheritance and the certainty that is given to us that
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:26.640]   we are the heirs of God, then the term 'sealing' is used, and the term 'earnest' elaborates
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.560]   the meaning a little bit further.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.800]   The earnest and the sealing are generally found together for that reason.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:40.240]   So it seems to me to be quite clear from these passages that the sealing with the Spirit
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.720]   is the same thing as the baptism with the Spirit.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.560]   We define the baptism in these terms.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:56.960]   That the baptism with the Spirit is the highest form of assurance of salvation that anybody
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:04.040]   can ever receive, and that with this assurance comes the power.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:10.240]   You see, if we are uncertain, if we are doubtful and hesitant, our witness is going to be affected.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:15.440]   If we are uncertain about the Word of God, as to what is true and what is not true, if
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.200]   I am uncertain about my relationship to him and the truth of these things in my case,
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   I shall be an advocate, not a witness.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.840]   But when a man is baptized with the Spirit or sealed with the Spirit, he knows the Spirit
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.360]   is the certainty.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.760]   And that leads not only to certainty in the individual, it leads to power.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.760]   It must do.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.760]   It's when we are certain we speak with authority and power.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.720]   We don't merely suggest something.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.040]   Our statements are not contingent, are not qualified.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.880]   We declare, that's the great word of the New Testament, "Him says Paul to the Athenians,
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.280]   I declare unto you whom you ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.280]   He knew.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:08.120]   And that is the great characteristic of the Christian Church in every period of revival
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.120]   and of reformation.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:15.400]   Well, now then, in order to make this yet clearer, I want to go a step further and to
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:22.280]   suggest to you that what the Apostle Paul says in Romans 8, 16 is again the same thing.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   What do you read there?
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.640]   Well, what you read there is this, in Romans 8, 16.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:34.920]   The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.000]   But go back, let me give you the context.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.280]   Let's start at verse 14.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:49.040]   For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:55.920]   For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:02.120]   of adoption, whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:08.520]   The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.520]   Go on.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:16.400]   And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:21.800]   If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   And go on.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.080]   For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.920]   glory which shall be revealed in us.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.840]   You note the context?
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.720]   How interesting these things are.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:40.040]   You see, the Apostle there is saying exactly the same thing as he's saying in Ephesians
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:44.320]   1, 13, but he varies his terminology.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.920]   Here in writing to the Romans again, he's concerned about Christians who are passing
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.400]   through a very difficult time.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.880]   That's the context.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:56.320]   I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.200]   glory which shall be revealed.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.200]   How do I know that?
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.800]   Here I am having a hard and a difficult time as a Christian in this world.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.320]   I'm told about these glorious things.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   How do I know that these belong to me?
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.040]   Well, the Apostle answers the question.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:22.840]   He says, "In you yourselves there is a spirit of adoption which cries, 'Abba, Father!'"
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:32.320]   He says, "You believe the truth and the Spirit is working in you, and you know what it is
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:38.620]   to have some cry in your heart to God, saying, 'Abba, Father!'"
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.760]   You may not have it often, but you know what it is.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.600]   You've known what it is as a little child runs to his father in trouble or to his mother.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.720]   You've known what it is to run to God and say, "Oh, Father, Abba, Father!"
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.720]   Spirit of adoption.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.440]   "That's a great help to you," says the Apostle.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:03.240]   "You're no longer in a spirit of heaviness or of bondage.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:09.560]   You are no longer under the law, trying to make yourselves Christian, thinking sometimes
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.680]   that you are Christians, then you fall into sin and you say, 'But am I a Christian at
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   all?'
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.960]   And you're uncertain about the whole of your justification.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.520]   That's the spirit of bondage.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.520]   That leads to fear.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.520]   You don't know whether you're a Christian or not.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.800]   But you're not that," says the Apostle.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.600]   "You haven't received that again.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.080]   You once were like that, but you're no longer like that."
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.040]   No, no.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:36.200]   You have received the spirit of adoption, whereby you cry, "Abba, Father!"
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:41.160]   All right, but the devil comes to you at that point and says, "Yes, I know."
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:46.000]   But you know, the human spirit is a very uncertain and a very unreliable thing.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.480]   Perhaps it's just good animal spirits.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.920]   You know how variable we are.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.800]   You wake up two mornings in succession and you may find yourself entirely different.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.440]   You're in a good mood one day and a bad mood the next.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.560]   You can't control these things.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.040]   And you may feel like this and say, "Abba, Father, but what will it be like tomorrow?"
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.720]   Are you going to rely upon your own feelings?
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.880]   The devil, as the accuser and the brethren, comes and he says things like that to us.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.480]   And it's very difficult to answer him because he's subtle and he's clever and he manipulates
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.480]   his arguments.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.720]   And he brings in modern psychology and so on.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.920]   And you begin to doubt the whole thing.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   "Well, now, wait a minute," says Paul, "I haven't finished.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.480]   I've got something stronger."
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:30.000]   On top of your spirit which cries, "Abba, Father!"
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.160]   There is this other thing.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:38.320]   The Spirit himself also beareth witness with our spirits.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.360]   Now, this isn't something in me.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.780]   This is something outside me.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:46.400]   This is the Spirit himself bearing witness with my spirit.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.680]   In other words, if you like, as a stamp of a seal upon my spirit.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.400]   Here is my title deed.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.960]   The stamp comes upon it.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.040]   The stamp is the Spirit.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:02.440]   He beareth witness with my spirit that I am a child of God.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:08.880]   Now, my dear friends, this, you see, isn't sanctification.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.480]   Sanctification is included in what we are told in verse 15, "my spirit."
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.680]   It works like this.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.760]   We all have known this.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.160]   I trust every one of us.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:26.480]   Not only those moments in prayer when you just say, "Father," and you rest in his
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:34.520]   love and in his arms as his child, but you know also about experiences when you read
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.520]   the Scriptures and they speak to you.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.000]   They don't speak to everybody, but the Scriptures speak to the Christian.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.640]   They've been indicted by the Holy Spirit and he's in you, and you know what it is
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:53.360]   to find the Spirit bringing the word out and speaking to you, and that gives you great
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   assurance.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.160]   You've got it in your spirit.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.160]   You know that you're a child of God.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.880]   You may remember a day when you felt the Scriptures were boring and you didn't understand
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.880]   them.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.040]   They meant nothing to you, but now they do very well.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   That's your spirit, in a sense, crying out, "Father."
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:16.800]   Or you may have known it in a service, and you felt things in a service which have given
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.080]   you assurance that you are a child of God.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:28.160]   Have I ever told you the story about William Wilberforce and his great friend, William
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.480]   Pitt the Younger, the great prime ministers of this country?
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.680]   Well, they were great friends.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:39.880]   Wilberforce, as you know, was a very fine Christian man, and he was very concerned about
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:45.640]   his friend William Pitt, who was a nominal Christian but no more.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:51.560]   And Wilberforce was very concerned about his friend, and he was always trying to speak
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.240]   to him about these things.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:57.720]   And he was particularly anxious that Pitt should go with him to listen to a famous preacher,
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.040]   evangelical preacher, here in London at that time called Richard Cecil.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.280]   And he worked on him for weeks and months.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.640]   At last, Pitt promised that the next Sunday morning he'd go with him to listen to this
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   preacher.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:16.280]   So Wilberforce was praying full of anticipation, and they went to the service and sat together.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.200]   And Richard Cecil was preaching and expounding the glories of the kingdom of God and the
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.280]   relationship of the child of God to the Father.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:30.600]   And Wilberforce was in ecstasy, rejoicing, reveling in this glorious truth.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.800]   And he was wondering what was happening to Pitt.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:39.320]   Pitt, I suppose, was an abler man than William Wilberforce, and he was the Prime Minister.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.080]   However, they went through the service, and the service ended.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:48.640]   And as they were walking out, Wilberforce was wondering what this had all meant to Pitt.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:53.200]   He didn't have long to wait, because just as they'd gone outside the vestibule, Pitt
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:59.760]   turned to Wilberforce, who'd been so ravished in soul by the exposition of the truth of
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.560]   God, Pitt turned to Wilberforce and said, "I didn't understand a word of what that
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.200]   man was talking about.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   What was it?"
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:14.640]   Now, my friends, that's how we get assurance, isn't it?
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:22.360]   If these things move you and ravish your heart, it's because you're a child of God.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:28.400]   You've got a nature that can receive the sincere milk of the Word, and it gives you assurance.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.520]   So you get it in prayer, in reading the Scriptures, in services, and in various other ways.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.240]   But you see, what the Apostle is saying is this.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.600]   All that's wonderful, but there's something still more wonderful, and it is the Spirit
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.760]   Himself bearing witness with our spirits.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:50.280]   This is the seal, this is the baptism, this is the love of God shed abroad in the heart.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.920]   This is something unanswerable.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.720]   You are looking on, you are listening.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.600]   You're not deducing it from yourself or from the signs of sanctification in you.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.520]   That's another way in which you can have assurance.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.360]   This is external, as it were.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:08.040]   This is objective, this is given, this happens to you.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:14.600]   And as I think I said on a recent Sunday morning, whether I did or not, let me say it now, there's
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:21.700]   only one thing beyond that, and that is to be in heaven itself, in the glory.
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:29.860]   This is the nearest we ever get in this world to heaven, when the Spirit Himself bears witness
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.940]   with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:40.340]   And if children, then heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:45.740]   My dear friends, I'm putting it to you, I'm telling you that these things are the same.
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:49.940]   Baptism of the Spirit, sealing with the Spirit, the earnestness of the Spirit, the assurance
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:55.420]   of the Spirit with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:03.020]   Let me end by quoting to you Charles Simeon again.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:10.900]   To many, he says, alas, the sealing of the Spirit is mere foolishness.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:14.460]   And unfortunately there are many such people in the Church today.
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.620]   They regard all this as foolishness.
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:22.140]   To many, alas, the sealing of the Spirit is mere foolishness.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:31.460]   But those who account it so speak evil of things that they understand not.
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:40.540]   Let us seek to experience it ourselves instead of censuring those who do.
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:49.700]   And I repeat and commend those words to you.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.820]   This is an entry in his diary.
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.100]   Was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.620]   This is long after his conversion.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.300]   Was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:09.420]   Oh, that all who deny the promise of the Father might thus receive it themselves.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:18.020]   Oh, that all were partakers of my joy.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.820]   Have you been sealed with the Spirit, my friend?
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:26.540]   Has the Spirit testified with your spirit that you are a child of God?
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:31.300]   I don't mean that you deduce it from your sanctification or from your reading of the
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.380]   Scripture or prayer or services or any of these other...
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:45.020]   Oh, I'm asking, has he himself authenticated, attested, sealed it to you, let you know beyond
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:54.100]   any doubt or uncertainty that you are a child of God and a joint heir with Christ?
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:59.340]   Thank God for the very multiplicity of the terms, for they all together, in showing us
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:06.900]   this great same truth from different aspects, help to enhance its glory and its wonder.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:14.540]   Oh, that all who deny the promise of the Father might thus receive it themselves.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:22.660]   Oh, that all were partakers of my joy.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:24.380]   Can you say that?
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.420]   That's possible to you.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:33.820]   Seek it, seek it until you find it and have it and are able to say, oh, that the whole
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:43.580]   world knew the joy that I now know as the Spirit fills my life and bears witness with
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:48.420]   my spirit that I am a child of God.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.420]   Amen.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:48:05.700]   The closing hymn is hymn number 394, 394, "Father of Peace and God of Love, we own
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:25.100]   thy power to save, the power by which our shepherd rose victorious o'er the grave."
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:30.020]   394.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:48.420]   The Father of Peace and God of Love, we own thy power to save, the power by which our
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:49:09.860]   shepherd rose victorious o'er the grave.
