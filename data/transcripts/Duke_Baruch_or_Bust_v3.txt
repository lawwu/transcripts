[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940]   This Financial Samurai podcast episode is proudly sponsored by Danielson Legal, a boutique
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.840]   law firm helping technology companies with their intellectual property, corporate matters,
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:24.800]   technology law transactions, and litigation since 2008.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.700]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast and I have with me a special
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.560]   guest, my wife, Sydney.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.280]   And in this episode, we're going to talk about the benefits of community college and whether
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.420]   students should take it easy during their middle school and grade school years and not
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.600]   stress so much about getting into one of these elite colleges.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.240]   So there's a great article out there called Duke, Baruch, or Bust?
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.360]   Parents debate if pricey private schools are still worth it.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.520]   Let me just read a little bit from the article to give you an idea of what it's talking about.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.320]   Clara is a mother whose son is a rising senior at an elite private school in Miami.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.460]   For the past few years, as his peers have been beefing up on extracurriculars and thinking
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.620]   about how to best translate their passions into projects that will stand out to college
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.480]   admissions officers, Clara's son hasn't been doing any of those things, and Clara, the
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.880]   mother, is thrilled.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.000]   Having watched acceptance rates plummet to the single digits as the cost of college has
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.720]   skyrocketed, Clara's family is happily resigned to not gunning for the Ivy League and the
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.920]   top 25 schools that most of her peer groups seize as the crowning achievement of a gilded
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.680]   high school career.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.520]   This means that her son is limiting the number of AP courses he takes to five throughout
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.760]   high school.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.000]   Some kids take as many as 12.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.320]   And if he says he feels like he doesn't want to do soccer this term because there's too
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.160]   much on his plate, no problem, Clara says.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.520]   We decided his health and wellness are much more important than getting a weighted 5.0
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.960]   GPA, having no social life, being stressed, and doing homework until two in the morning.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   So what are your thoughts about Clara's attitude and her son's attitude towards taking it more
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.960]   easy during high school?
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.960]   The thing that jumped out to me the most was 12 AP classes?
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.400]   How many kids are able to take that many?
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   That sounds crazy.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   Five?
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.960]   Five itself is a lot, way, way above average, I would think.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.240]   Maybe above our average, but not today.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.040]   These days, it's all about mega competition.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.800]   I guess a lot has changed since we went to school.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.480]   I think I took, I can't even remember.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.520]   Maybe I took three APs in high school, and that was tough.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.440]   Well, that's why you ended up at William & Mary with me, because we were just average.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.720]   So what are your thoughts about taking a more easy course load in high school and not worrying
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.520]   about getting into one of these top 25 or top 50 colleges?
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.480]   Well, I think it depends on how you define easy.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.720]   If you consider easy 5 AP classes, that to me sounds like her son is still trying very
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.160]   hard and doing well.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.560]   I don't think, again, we don't have a high school student right now, so I don't know
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.160]   if that's really the norm to take a minimum of 5 AP classes.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.380]   She knows her son best.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:49.380]   It sounds like what his peers are doing is just not feasible for her son's mental health.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.960]   I think that's great that they've found a healthy balance for him and their family.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.900]   If going to community college is better for balance, then that's the best way to go.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.500]   So imagine if you went to private school for 13 years, you spent $500,000 for private grade
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.540]   school and you went to community college.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.100]   What are your thoughts about that?
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.580]   I think there's nothing wrong with going to community college.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.820]   And even if you do, you can still have the option to transfer at some point during your
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.900]   college duration.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.900]   What do you think?
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.420]   I think community college is the way to go for people like us.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.140]   We went to state schools.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.620]   We don't have really high academic achievements.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.980]   Just look at our SAT scores, they were quite mediocre.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.660]   We're Asian-American, so we have this Asian penalty for some reason to need to score even
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.500]   higher to get the same chances for our kids to get into college.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.100]   So I feel like for us, there's really little to no hope to get into a top 25 or top 50
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.420]   university, especially the private ones, because they have their standard criteria and they
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.660]   pick and choose who gets in and who doesn't.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.780]   And a lot of times it's subjective.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.580]   And so I was thinking to myself, well, maybe community college is the way to go.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.100]   And I wrote a post about community college being a great option.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.340]   And I got so many great responses from the readership.
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.580]   For example, Champ, a reader named Champ said, "Both of us went to community college and
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.940]   earned six figures before we both retired in our 60s.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.860]   All our children went to community college and transferred to state universities.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.220]   Total college costs for five children, $180,000.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.520]   No grants, no scholarships, nothing.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.820]   They paid their own way.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.500]   They all earned over six figures.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.260]   And one son and his wife earned seven figures.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.220]   Relocate and live responsibly instead of high rolling nonsense."
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.780]   And I really love that feedback.
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.940]   And after I wrote the post, I had another 40 plus commenters who went to community college
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.500]   and they're all making six figure incomes.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.980]   They're all living pretty healthy quality of lifestyles.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.860]   And I'm thinking to myself, this sounds like the way.
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.220]   Maybe two years community college, it's probably going to be free by the time our kids go to
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.220]   school.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.660]   They can transfer to a four year state university if they want to save more money.
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.460]   Or if they can get scholarships, they can transfer to a private four year university.
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.660]   Sounds good to me.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.660]   Are you on board?
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.380]   - I don't have any problem with that.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.340]   Because this is something that I'm really thinking about.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.900]   Because I don't want to go through having a stressed out son and daughter who thinks
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.820]   they must take 10 AP courses and get a 5.0 weighted GPA and do all these extracurricular
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.100]   activities and try to save the world.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.220]   It just seems ridiculous to me.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.300]   - It's way too competitive.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.500]   And we're going to figure things out when the time comes.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.980]   And we're going to do what's best for them.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:06.260]   And even, let's say they, for some reason, they got into one of the top colleges based
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.380]   on a talent, for example.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.620]   But we knew that they would not be able to keep up academically.
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.460]   Even if they got into that top school, I'm not sure I would want them to go if I knew
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.220]   that they would be struggling for four years.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.860]   I think there is a lot of value in balancing mental health and going to a school where
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.220]   you will feel confident.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.620]   You'll be able to excel.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.560]   You'll be able to learn at a pace that you can keep up with.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:44.580]   So that when it comes time to graduate, you'll be in a good headspace and have a good foundation
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.860]   and have built relationships with your professors and your peers and be ready to jump into the
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.740]   real world.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.180]   - Right.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.620]   I would also want to share a comment from Zen Master.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.620]   And he's interesting.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.980]   I think he's a lawyer.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.900]   And he's so candid in his thoughts and the comments.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:11.980]   He was just saying, "I've got my twin daughters and they are just depending on me for everything.
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.300]   They went to private universities.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.060]   Doesn't seem like they'll be able to get good jobs.
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:22.060]   Whenever they have some kind of expense, they call me to ask for money."
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.380]   And one of them is an adult who's graduated already.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:31.300]   And I asked him, "Why not just not give her the money?"
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.300]   And he goes, "I just can't do it.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.260]   I'm too dependent on her."
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:40.180]   And so I asked him, "Why, if you could rewind time, why did you end up going this route
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.020]   of super privileged lifestyle, private college and everything?"
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.560]   And one of the reasons he talked about was peer pressure.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.940]   He was saying even though he realized that giving them all the privileges in the world
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.620]   was maybe not a great way to harden them up, right?
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.420]   Because if you are soft, you create soft kids.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.260]   If you are hard, maybe you create harder kids.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:12.300]   And he said peer pressure, in terms of peer pressure from other parents, from teachers,
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.300]   from guidance counselors, from other friends, parents, right?
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.900]   Who have kids.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:24.300]   He said he just couldn't say no to that private college route due to peer pressure.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.140]   Do you think you will succumb to peer pressure, Sydney, from other moms and other dads out
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.140]   there?
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.260]   I don't think so.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:37.340]   I think I'm pretty chill in general in terms of my personality and lifestyle.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.900]   Because at the end of the day, we want our kids to be happy.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.340]   We want them to succeed.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.500]   We want them to feel confident.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.420]   And even if they somehow manage to get into a top private university, if we knew that
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:55.580]   that wouldn't help them succeed in life, then I don't think we would encourage that.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:03.260]   We would obviously have many discussions together to figure out what we felt would be the best
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.260]   decision.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.180]   Ultimately, they would need to choose because it's their decision, their life.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.100]   But I don't think I would succumb to peer pressure.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.860]   Why would we want to make someone else happy if it's not going to benefit our children?
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.860]   Okay.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.020]   Well, let me ask you this then.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:26.520]   What do you think about sending our kids to public school and saving a lot of money over
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:33.220]   the next 12, 13 years, given we don't succumb to peer pressure?
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.020]   And the path to community college sounds like a good one.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:45.180]   It all depends on circumstances and there are a lot of challenges that we've witnessed
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.820]   in the San Francisco public school system that we don't feel are the best fit for our
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.460]   kids.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:57.320]   And for some families, it's great and I'm all for that.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.340]   We just have to look at what works best for our own family.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:08.820]   Yeah, because I know if I was six years old, let's say, and my parents said, "Would
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:15.180]   you like to go to a private grade school and get no money upon graduating from high school?
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.060]   Or would you rather go to a public school and get $500,000?"
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.640]   I would say, "Give me $500,000 for sure."
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.300]   And one of the reasons why is because I went to public school in high school and it was
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   fine.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.660]   Obviously, there were some ups and down moments, but I was like, "Give me the $500,000.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.660]   That's a no-brainer."
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.660]   And if I can invest this...
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.500]   You're talking about asking a six-year-old this?
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.500]   Come on.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.500]   That's not...
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:47.180]   I know it's not realistic, but you can ask a 13-year-old before he or she goes to private
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:54.620]   high school, "Would you rather have, let's say, $200,000 or $250,000 and go to public
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.940]   school, public high school, or go to private high school?"
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.700]   I think these are questions we need to ask as personal finance people.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.260]   We need to understand the opportunity cost.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.380]   Because let me continue in this article on Duke or Baruch and where this quote came from.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:14.220]   So this mother gave her son, who attends an elite Manhattan high school, an ultimatum.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.580]   "It's either Duke or Baruch.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:23.420]   I'm not paying $80,000 a year so you can go to Middlebury and learn to build a bonfire."
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.700]   Although the family has means and can afford a school like Middlebury, one of the top liberal
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:33.660]   arts colleges in the nation, with a 14% acceptance rate, the mother doesn't see the practicality
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:39.020]   of paying for a so-called "select tier 2" college in today's world.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:45.260]   Her feeling is that an Ivy or Ivy-like school like Duke, Stanford, MIT, etc. degree offers
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:52.500]   a level of prestige that will more readily translate into job opportunities, thus justifying
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.860]   the price.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.420]   And I thought this quote was awesome because my Mandarin teacher in college decided to
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.180]   leave the College of William & Mary and go to Middlebury.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.180]   And I remember Middlebury always being a wonderful liberal arts college with a wonderful, wonderful
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.380]   language program.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:14.940]   And this is also a school that you and I probably would never be able to get into because of
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.460]   its low acceptance rate.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.660]   And in retrospect, I'm thinking to myself, "Yay!
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.500]   I'm glad we weren't able to go to these expensive schools because we were able to graduate without
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.700]   a lot of debt and move on with our lives."
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:35.420]   So, I guess my hope is, it sounds great to me, so you think you're not going to succumb
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.420]   to peer pressure.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:42.460]   I feel I'm a little bit more realistic when I see other people with a nice car or a nice
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.700]   house, you know, promotions and pay.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.380]   I feel a little bit like, "Oh, I want to have a nice house.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.500]   I want those nice shoes.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.900]   I want that nicer car.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.220]   Why not me too?
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.540]   Why not for our kids too?"
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.540]   You sure you don't feel any of that?
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.360]   No, it's just a very simple example.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.860]   We go to a lot of events, playdates and whatnot.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:13.820]   And there's moms there who are always fashionable and looking great.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.440]   And I think that's awesome.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.540]   For me, I'm just not into that.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:24.900]   I would much rather buy a cheap outfit at Target or whatever because I know I'm going
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.900]   to get stains on it within a week.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.340]   That's just who I am.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.060]   I'm just very practical that way.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.500]   But everybody spends money differently.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.140]   I don't even know if you would consider that peer pressure in terms of looking your best.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.820]   Yeah, it is social pressure.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:45.220]   I don't feel peer pressure to change myself in order to fit in.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.740]   I've never heard anybody say that they don't experience any peer pressure.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:57.060]   I remember when I met you in college, there was the grunge phase and you had baggy pants
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.460]   and bell bottoms and stuff like that.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.220]   Isn't that peer pressure?
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:07.360]   So what I experienced as a student is different than what I experience now as an adult.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.620]   I think there was a lot of pressure to fit in at school.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.340]   You didn't want to be the odd one out and not have friends.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:21.740]   I have adult friends who I have similarities with and also who I have plenty of differences
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.340]   with, but I'm confident with who I am now as an adult.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:31.460]   So I don't feel the same types of peer pressure that I did when I was younger.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:38.260]   Do I feel some pressure for our son and daughter to be well-behaved and to socialize?
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.380]   Well, yes, I do have that kind of pressure.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:47.180]   So you're saying if one of your good mom friends, for example, son, ended up getting
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:54.860]   into a top 20 university, you wouldn't feel a little bit envious or pressured or like
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:00.100]   you noticed that he was doing really well academically freshman and sophomore year,
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.700]   entering all these competitions, doing great on PSAT, doing all this extracurricular.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.700]   You wouldn't feel like, "Oh, maybe our son should do the same?"
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:16.300]   I might feel some jealousy in terms of achievements, but again, we've talked about this before
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.340]   in terms of sports.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.980]   There's a lot of parents out there who are sending their kids to three to four different
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.620]   sports activities a week.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.580]   Their kids are having fun.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.620]   Great.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.380]   For us, I don't feel that's necessary.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.500]   Our son isn't that into sports.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.780]   So why would we want to put him through that if he's going to be miserable and it costs
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.780]   money?
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.660]   We find other activities that he's interested in.
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.140]   Swimming, for example, you guys worked on that.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:49.580]   That's something that was a sports activity that you guys focused on and he loved it.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:55.420]   So we're going to focus on things that our kids are interested in and be happy with that.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.420]   I hear you.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.060]   I believe you.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.980]   But I think when the, what is it called?
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:06.340]   When the rubber meets the road, when it's time, when he's in high school to apply to
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:12.820]   college and get a job or whatever, I think you're going to feel a little bit different.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:18.500]   I think it's important for parents to actually pull or push, whatever the phrase may be,
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:25.140]   a little bit more than kids will do on their own so they can self-discover and they can
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.020]   meet their potential.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.580]   One story for me is I liked tennis growing up, but I wasn't pushed hard enough to train.
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.900]   I didn't get coaches.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.580]   I didn't enter tournaments.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.180]   As a result, I wasn't as good as I could have been.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.820]   I'm good, but I'm not great.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:48.540]   I always wonder, wow, what if my parents pushed me harder to train more on the tennis side,
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.180]   gave me a better framework, more consistency?
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.820]   I think I would have been better and I definitely think I could have played for college.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.940]   I was recruited for a D3 college.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.220]   I think that's why you and I are so involved with our kids.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.940]   That's something that we really care about and we want to be able to support them in
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.460]   their biggest interests.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:14.060]   I think what will affect me way more emotionally is if, let's say, our kids have their hearts
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:19.140]   set on a specific school and we've talked about it and we think that school is within
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.140]   reason, they apply to it and they get rejected.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.900]   That's going to hurt me way more than their classmates getting into a school.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:33.380]   If it was the same school that our kids wanted to get into, then yeah, that's going to hurt.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.700]   The classmate got in and our kids didn't.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.460]   We would say, "What's wrong with us?"
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.460]   That's going to hurt.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.460]   That's going to hurt.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.380]   I'd be way more emotional about that.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.900]   I think the reason why I'm more sensitive to rejection is because I've been rejected
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.780]   way more times.
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.660]   I'm always putting myself out there, whether it's trying to get business when I was working.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.700]   Nobody would pick up the phone, respond to my emails.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.180]   They'd say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.860]   I compete in USTA tennis at the 4.5 and 5.0 level.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.180]   I lost so many times, but I kept on competing.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.740]   Many times when I lost, I felt crushed for a day.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.260]   I was like, "Man, I trained so hard and I still lost.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.260]   How frustrating."
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.660]   I started Financial Samurai in 2009.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.060]   I remember trying to join these blog networks, which were popular at the time.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.540]   I got no's from all eight.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.260]   Like, "No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.340]   Who the hell are you?
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.340]   Go away."
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.420]   But I just keep on trying.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:40.460]   Over time, I've become more hardened, but I still feel that sting, that pain of rejection,
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.620]   which as a father, I know our kids will get rejected so many times.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.580]   Whereas I think for you, you had a different type of job when you were working and you
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.060]   don't put yourself out there as much as I do, which means you don't feel that sting
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.020]   of rejection as often.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.700]   Is that a fair assessment?
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.940]   In terms of the type of job that you had, yeah, for sure.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.020]   I experienced a little bit of that.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:09.620]   When I had in college, I had this very, very minimum, low minimum wage job where I had
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.540]   to try to raise, fundraise for the school.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.940]   I had cold call people.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.940]   It was awful.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.540]   I hated that job so much.
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:23.860]   And yes, I was rejected probably 99.9% of the time on all those calls.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.860]   So you didn't succeed at all?
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:25.860]   It was awful.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.860]   I did not succeed.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.660]   I was like, "I cannot be in sales when I graduate from college."
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.660]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.660]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:41.820]   So yes, in the type of role that you had at work and all of your athletics, yeah, you
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:48.660]   definitely had to face way more rejections and failures than I did.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.580]   Well, so maybe what we should do is to kind of equalize how we feel about rejection and
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.420]   failure and the sting is to get you to put yourself out there more.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:07.980]   Maybe try to send a manuscript to a publisher, for example, or try to do competitive orchestra
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.980]   or violin or do a solo.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.300]   Really put yourself out there.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.780]   I've done stuff like that and not gotten the results that I've wanted.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.780]   Sure.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.900]   I've had plenty of rejection in my life as well.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:25.580]   So how about we just continue to do that because it's been years since you did that.
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.980]   So you want to put the pressure on me?
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:33.380]   Yes, because if you feel the pressure and you get rejected at this age, then we'll always
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.500]   know what it's like to try really hard and fail, which would make us, I think, a little
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.500]   bit more empathetic.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.500]   Okay, I'll try out for America's Got Talent.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.180]   I'll get rejected before I even get my audition taken.
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.180]   Yes.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.180]   All right.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.180]   Great.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.420]   Promise me you're going to do some audition and try.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.420]   Try.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.420]   You never know.
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.420]   But I feel that a lot of people don't try to put themselves out there, try to do something
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:02.220]   entrepreneurial or new is because they're afraid of rejection and then it just hurts
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.380]   so much.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.060]   For some reason, I have this defiant attitude.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.300]   If you reject me, I don't care.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.220]   I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:16.060]   But I think that's a personality trait, but it's also honed over years and years of experience.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:21.300]   Yeah, there's this common thing that people are too afraid to try because they're afraid
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.580]   that they can't do it.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.820]   I think that's a common fear that a lot of people face.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.820]   Okay.
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.060]   Well, we don't want our kids to get rejected, but I think rejection is good because it makes
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.940]   them appreciate and try harder.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:39.100]   But I think we can't set their expectations if you agree to have them go to community
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.100]   college.
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.100]   Right?
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.100]   It's cheaper.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.100]   It's two years.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.860]   It doesn't require you getting straight A's in high school to go to community college.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.260]   And if they do well in community college, they can always transfer to a four-year state
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.380]   school or private school.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.980]   What do you think about going forward this plan as they enter middle school and high
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.140]   school?
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:07.300]   I think it's something that we're going to keep open and we will apply to – I think
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.980]   we're going to have to apply to a lot of schools.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.580]   I feel so many people – it's just like a numbers game.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.180]   You have to apply to a bunch in hopes that you'll get into one or two.
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.300]   Right.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.180]   And just for people curious about what the average income is for people who graduate
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.540]   from community college, it's about $33,000 to $34,000.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.620]   And the average income for people who graduate from a four-year state school is closer to
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.260]   $50,000 to $55,000.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:41.060]   And I think the average income for Ivy League graduates is about $5,000 to $8,000 higher
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.460]   initially.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.620]   But it's still not that impressive if you graduate from an Ivy League university.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.060]   I have an article on this.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.420]   I forgot the exact numbers.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.780]   But I was thinking to myself, "What?
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.620]   That's all you make five years out of college from an Ivy League or 10 years out?"
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:24:00.300]   I was thinking to myself, "Why stress over for five to eight years of your life during
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:08.220]   grade school to achieve that when the chances are 95% to 99% chance you're going to get
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.220]   rejected?"
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.220]   All right.
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:16.300]   Well, I'm really pleased by that because one of my stresses is are children doing well
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:22.620]   enough in school to get into a decent college, to get a job and be financially independent
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.580]   or at least independent from us?
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.380]   Because there's nothing greater.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:32.540]   Well, there are other things greater, but it feels wonderful to be independent and not
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.420]   have to rely on your parents once you're an adult.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.340]   Especially as, I don't know, I think as a male, because as a male, not only do we – I
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.780]   feel like we have to take care of ourselves.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.620]   We have this growing up aspect where we're thinking, "Oh, we've got to provide enough
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.140]   to take care of the family."
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.420]   And I know things have changed over time, but that's how I felt.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.220]   Any last words before we let the audience go?
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:00.180]   I just wish the best of luck to all the parents out there who are going through the application
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.460]   process this year.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.460]   All righty.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.780]   Well, thank you everyone for listening.
