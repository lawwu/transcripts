[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.840]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles, the ninth chapter and the sixth verse.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.320]   The sixth verse in the ninth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.200]   And he trembling and astonished said, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.840]   And the Lord said unto him, "Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.120]   thou must do."
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.920]   Let me again remind you of the context of this important statement by reading to you
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.640]   the previous five verses.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.640]   And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord,
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.480]   went unto the high priest, and desired of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues,
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.840]   that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.060]   bound unto Jerusalem.
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.000]   And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.160]   And suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:19.320]   And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080]   thou me?"
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.760]   And he answered, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.020]   And the Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.640]   It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.160]   And he trembling and astonished said, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.440]   And the Lord said unto him, "Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.880]   thou must do."
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:58.000]   Now you notice that there is a difference in the versions with regard to these verses.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.640]   And that the revised version, I believe I'm right in saying, which you have in front of
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.400]   you, leaves out certain words which I've just been reading, such as "It is hard for thee
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.080]   to kick against the pricks."
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.260]   And also, "And he trembling and astonished said, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.320]   It goes on straight to the statement, "The Lord said unto him, 'Arise, and go into the
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   city.'"
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:28.160]   But I adhere to the authorized version because it seems to me to be perfectly clear that
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.920]   what we have here is essential to a true understanding of what the Lord said to Saul.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.840]   It was in reply to Saul's question that he told him to go into the city.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.320]   Saul had made his request, "What would thou have me to do?"
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.920]   And the Lord gives the reply.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.160]   So that I'm quite sure that this fuller account, this fuller version, which we are given here
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.960]   in this authorized version, is in accord with the facts.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.920]   And it is to this particular statement that is recorded here that I'm calling your attention
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.460]   once more.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.900]   We are engaged in considering together the account which is given in the Scriptures of
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.140]   how this man, Saul of Tarsus, became the mighty apostle Paul.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:26.260]   And we are doing so in order that we may study it, in order to learn for ourselves some of
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:35.320]   the great principles that govern this great question of how one is to become a Christian.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.560]   That is the practical object which we have in calling attention to this.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.880]   We are not coming together simply out of a general interest.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.920]   We are not animated by some mere antiquarian interest.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.580]   These things are entrancing in and of themselves.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:59.680]   But frankly, I myself am concerned about them simply because they do show us the way to
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.640]   have the same life as was given to this man, Saul of Tarsus, the life which made him a
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.600]   Christian man.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.720]   And therefore I say that it is of great importance that we should study what we have here.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.240]   The apostle himself encourages us to do so, as I've pointed out on several occasions.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.480]   He says that he can be regarded as a kind of pattern, a kind of example, of what happens
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.300]   in salvation.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.080]   And taking him at his word, we are studying his own case.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.360]   Now we've looked at it from various standpoints.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.760]   We've looked at the hindrances, the obstacles, the things that keep a man from becoming a
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.040]   Christian.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.040]   We've seen them in the case of Saul.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.840]   We've seen that, in essence, they're the same in all other cases.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.960]   And then we came to consider the climactic moment, this great event which took place
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.640]   on the way to Damascus.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.760]   Because it was as a result of this that this man, Saul of Tarsus, ceased to be the blaspheming
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.920]   persecutor of Christ and his people and became the greatest preacher of the gospel that the
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.660]   church has ever known.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.400]   And it all happened, I say, in that way.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.000]   And we have been considering it together.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.040]   The essence of the matter can be put in this form.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:37.800]   Here on this road to Damascus, the apostle was arrested and caused to look at himself
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   and to see himself as he really was.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.840]   That happened to him because of the second thing, which was that he came face to face
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.760]   with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.020]   And now there, in those two statements, you have the essence of Christianity.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.760]   No man can be a Christian without knowing himself.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.720]   No man can be a Christian without knowing the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.500]   And that's precisely what happened to this man on the road to Damascus.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.260]   Now I've been emphasizing, and I want to repeat it, lest anybody should misunderstand.
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:24.560]   I am not saying that we must have exactly the same experience in all its concomitants.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.400]   I say we must know the essence of the experience.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.440]   But there are certain factors and features which vary from case to case.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.920]   It is given to very few to see the risen Lord, as the apostle did.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.940]   Indeed, I doubt whether anybody has ever seen the risen Lord in the way that this man did
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.060]   see him since.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.640]   People have testified to visions.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.820]   This wasn't a vision.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.460]   He actually saw the risen Lord of glory, and that made him an apostle.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.360]   He can argue later, "Have I not seen the Lord?"
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360]   He had seen him.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.960]   Now I say that doesn't happen to all.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.520]   But while that doesn't happen to all, and while certain dramatic elements in the story
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.180]   are often absent in people's experiences, and therefore we don't insist upon them, we
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:20.780]   do say that the principles which come into play and into operation are always present
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.860]   and must always be present.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:32.400]   Because the apostle Paul, as a Christian, he is no different from any other Christian.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.140]   He describes himself as the chief of sinners, and as a Christian he is just a man who has
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:44.620]   been saved by the grace of God, as every other single Christian, it doesn't matter how unknown
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.260]   or how humble.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.200]   The dramatic character varies, but the thing itself is the same.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.180]   And we started by saying that what happens when a man becomes a Christian is that he
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:02.980]   is born again, that God operates upon his soul by the Holy Spirit, and that happens
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:09.060]   in every single case, so there are certain things that must of necessity be the same
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.360]   in every single case.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.820]   And it is for those things that I am calling attention in particular.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.560]   Now then, we've arrived at this point.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.780]   We see that as the result of this which happened to him, certain other things happened to the
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.920]   apostle.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.180]   And here are the things that happened.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.940]   Having been brought face to face with himself and what he was doing, having been brought
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:42.900]   face to face with the Lord, I read that he trembling and astonished said, "Lord, what
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.820]   would thou have me to do?"
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:53.460]   Now then, here are the consequences of this great change which we are considering together.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:59.700]   And it is very important that we should consider them together, because these things, again
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.140]   I say, are common to all cases.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:10.020]   Let me hasten to add once more, not to the same degree, not always to the same intensity,
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.780]   but they are always present.
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:18.260]   In other words, I am laying it down as being vital and essential doctrine, that the things
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:26.620]   that are summarized in this sixth verse, in this authorized version, are always present
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.100]   in the case of every single Christian.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:41.220]   And the three elements are the astonishment, the trembling, and the submission, which is
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:47.780]   expressed in the form of the question, "What wouldst thou have me to do?"
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:53.300]   In other words, my contention is this, that when a man is a Christian, the whole of his
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.740]   personality is engaged and involved.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:06.020]   He receives the truth with his mind, but it has an effect upon his emotions, and in turn
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.860]   it has an effect upon his will.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:17.060]   Now it is an essential part of my whole position to say that this is always and of necessity
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.780]   true.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:26.700]   Once more, again because of misunderstanding, let me hasten to say that the intensity of
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.500]   the emotion varies tremendously from case to case.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:37.580]   The intensity with which the will comes into operation also varies from case to case.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:46.500]   But my contention is that unless a man's heart and his will are involved as well as his mind,
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.740]   that he is not a Christian at all, whatever may have happened to him.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:58.780]   Now I know that there are many who would object to this teaching, to this doctrine.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:04.820]   They say, "But you are now insisting that we should all have certain feelings."
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.980]   And they say, "Isn't it dangerous to insist upon that?
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.460]   The Scriptures do not say that you must have certain feelings.
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.820]   All the Scriptures say, they say, is this, that thou must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.460]   and that if you do believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, you are saved."
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.540]   And therefore they say, "Any man who says, 'I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,' must
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.180]   be saved and must of necessity be a Christian."
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:37.740]   Now I am taking leave to question that statement, and I am questioning it for this reason.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.780]   I regard this as something which is of the most vital importance, as I am going to try
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.500]   to show you.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.460]   Now let me put it in this form.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:56.540]   I am not saying that it is the business of a preacher or an evangelist deliberately to
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.780]   work up people's emotions.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.060]   Indeed my position is that he should never do that.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:10.460]   Neither am I saying that it is the business of the preacher to call men to feel something.
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.660]   The call of preaching is to believe.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.540]   There I think we are all agreed.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.780]   It is not that I am saying that emotion is a value in and of itself.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:29.740]   It is not that I am suggesting for a moment that emotions alone are sufficient.
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:38.060]   But what I am saying, and I want to press it, is this, that emotion is inevitable and
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:48.900]   must be present to some degree if a man has truly believed on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.180]   Now let me put it in this way.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:13:00.660]   There is nothing which is perhaps so important for our souls and our eternal destiny as that
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:10.900]   we should draw a distinction between intellectual assent to truth and a saving and a true belief
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.940]   in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.940]   Let me repeat that.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.580]   I regard it as the most important statement which a man can ever make from a Christian
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.580]   pulpit.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:28.940]   There is nothing, I say, which is of more importance than to draw a very clear and sharp
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:40.380]   distinction between a mere intellectual assent to truth and a saving belief of and acceptance
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.860]   of that truth.
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.940]   Now let me establish what I am saying.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:52.700]   The Bible exhorts us to draw that very distinction.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.100]   Now let me show you how it does that.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:02.580]   It teaches us very clearly that there are such people as what we may describe as temporary
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:08.980]   believers, people who think that they have believed savingly and that they're Christian
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.820]   who nevertheless have never been Christian.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   Where does it teach that?
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.500]   Well let me show you.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:22.940]   Our Lord himself teaches that very plainly and clearly in the parable of the sower.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.460]   You remember it, the men who went out to sow seed.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:32.380]   Some fell by the wayside, some fell on the stony ground, and some fell amongst thorns,
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.540]   and the other fell into the good ground.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.200]   But you remember what he tells us about the first groups, that it sprang up at once.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   It seemed to be life.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.780]   They seemed to be Christians.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.060]   But subsequently it was quite clear that they'd never had life in themselves.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:54.560]   There was nothing real there, a temporary appearance which disappeared and vanished.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.100]   That is our Lord's own teaching.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.140]   And he obviously teaches it in order to warn us to be careful and to test ourselves.
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.800]   But he does it again.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.580]   At the end of the Sermon on the Mount he tells us that certain people will come to him on
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.800]   the great day of judgment and say, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.300]   and in thy name done many wonderful works?"
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.940]   But he will profess unto them and say, "I never knew you.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.180]   Depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:34.500]   That can have only one meaning, and that is that those people thought and imagined that
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.500]   they were Christians.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.940]   They call him Lord.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.980]   They say that they've believed in him.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.940]   They're addressing him as Lord.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.060]   And they've always thought that this belief of theirs was enough.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.860]   And they say they've done this and that in his name.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.500]   And yet he will say unto them, "I never knew you.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.860]   Depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:01.380]   Is there any other possible explanation of that save the one I'm suggesting to you?
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.820]   That it isn't enough for a man to say that he believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, a true
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.340]   belief includes more than that.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:16.500]   And the more than that is in the realm of the emotions and of the will, the things that
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.540]   Paul, the Saul of Tarsus, displayed on this road to Damascus.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.060]   But there is much further evidence.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.780]   I can't give it you all this evening.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:29.700]   Read the 13th chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, and there again you will find
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.140]   our Lord says exactly the same thing.
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.980]   He says many at that day will knock at the door and say, "Let us in."
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.860]   And he will not let them in.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.740]   Somebody asked him the question, "Are there be few or many that are saved?"
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.500]   And his answer was, "You strive to enter in at the straight gate.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.740]   For at that day many will seek to enter in and shall not be able to."
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.460]   They say, "We've always believed."
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.540]   But they're not in.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:01.300]   And then of course finally you get it, do you not, in the famous parable of the wise
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.620]   and the foolish virgins?
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:11.620]   The whole point of that picture of the foolish virgins is that they thought they were Christian.
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.300]   They assumed they were Christian.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.940]   It's a parable spoken to test profession, deliberately to test profession.
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.180]   It's not a parable spoken to the world at large.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.500]   It's a parable spoken to people who think that they're believers.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.520]   There are true believers and those who think they're believers, and it shows you the difference
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.540]   in the distinction between them.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.780]   It's the whole point of the parable.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:41.140]   Very well then I say our Lord clearly teaches that there are temporary believers, people
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.100]   who've given an intellectual assent and thought all is well.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.540]   They thought they'd believed, but they've not believed.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.180]   Or let me put it in this second form.
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:18:00.300]   True belief always involves the heart and the will as well as the mind.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.620]   Now the Apostle Paul puts that twice over in the one epistle to the Romans.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.740]   In the sixth chapter and in the seventeenth verse he puts it like this.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:16.900]   But God be thanked, he says, that he were the servants of sin.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:21.580]   But you're no longer the servants of sin, you're now Christians.
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.580]   How?
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.580]   Well this is how he puts it.
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.820]   But he have obeyed, there's the will, from the heart, there's the emotion.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.820]   What?
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.820]   The form of sound doctrine or words delivered unto you.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.300]   The belief that they've accepted with the mind.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.700]   But you notice that in defining the Christian he doesn't say you've believed the truth.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.260]   He says you have obeyed from the heart.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.660]   The whole personality is involved.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.260]   He my friend takes up the whole person.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:57.460]   And if he doesn't take up the whole person, I say there is no value in the supposed belief.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.420]   Take the Apostle saying it again in the tenth chapter of that epistle to the Romans in the
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.900]   ninth verse.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:11.860]   He says if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thine heart
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:17.460]   that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved, the heart is the center of
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.660]   the personality.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.940]   It includes the emotions and the will as well as the mind.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:28.300]   The whole man, he again emphasizes, is involved in a true belief.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.820]   You see it's a very simple thing for a man to say Lord, Lord.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.380]   It's a very simple thing for a man who says well now do you believe this to say yes.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.460]   And then he's told you're a Christian and he assumes he's a Christian.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.700]   Not of necessity says the scripture.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:49.300]   You've got to test that as you value your soul and as you value your eternal destiny.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.580]   Someone may say but aren't you shutting the door against us.
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:58.460]   I am repeating the words of the Lord Jesus Christ who says strive to enter in.
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:04.020]   Who says straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.580]   be that find it.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.340]   Not broad is the gate and wide is the way that leadeth unto life and many go crowding
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.340]   in at it.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.100]   Not at all the exact opposite.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:23.340]   And it is his own word that exhorts us and pleads with us to test and to examine ourselves
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:29.260]   lest we be deluding ourselves with a mere intellectual ascent to the truth.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.380]   But let me go on.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:40.020]   The Bible always describes true believers to us in terms which include, I say this,
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.620]   this whole personality.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:49.340]   They describe the Christian as one who not only believes in the Lord but who loves him.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:54.980]   Whom having not seen he love in whom though now we see him not yet believing he rejoice
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.500]   with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.140]   I say on the basis of that that you can't believe on the Lord Jesus Christ without rejoicing
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.140]   in him.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.500]   It's impossible.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.180]   And unless what you think is your belief has led you to rejoice, well I say you better
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.540]   examine it again and make sure of it.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.180]   The Christian in the New Testament is one who rejoices in Christ.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.020]   He loves him.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.260]   He's discovered a joy and a happiness.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.220]   Look at the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.120]   What a lyrical book it is.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.140]   What happy people these were.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:35.700]   Gladly being thrown to the lions in the arena, giving up their lives rather than deny him.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.260]   Joy, feeling is involved.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.860]   The will is engaged.
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:49.380]   You cannot believe on the Lord Jesus Christ truly in a purely intellectual manner.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.580]   It is contrary to the very nature of belief to do this.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:59.420]   And the character of the truth also makes it impossible.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:05.620]   Only to see him and to know him affects the whole man as it did Saul of Tarsus on the
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.180]   road to Damascus.
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.620]   It must do that.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.300]   His character, his person alone demands that and insists upon it.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.660]   And that is the scriptural teaching.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:22.620]   So I wind up this argument by putting it like this.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:29.060]   There I've given it to you in the form of perfectly plain and explicit teaching.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:35.140]   But all that is supported and substantiated by the cases which the Bible in its condescension
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.180]   gives us.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:41.380]   I mean by that that if you examine the conversion of anybody in the Bible, you'll find that
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.180]   these things always happened.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:48.540]   Saul of Tarsus is converted on the road to Damascus and he was astonished and he trembled
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:53.020]   and he gave in.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:23:01.820]   The Philippian jailer in exactly the same way trembled and was astonished and gave in
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:06.900]   and surrendered himself and experienced great joy.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.900]   There is not a single case I say but that these elements are invariably present.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:16.060]   Go through your scriptures, seek them out for yourselves and I suggest to you that you
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.700]   will find it is always the case.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.420]   You will know them.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:31.980]   All this which is taught so plainly in the scripture is confirmed abundantly by what
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:37.180]   happens in every period of revival.
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.940]   Now fortunately we can read the accounts of the great revivals that have taken place in
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.060]   the history of the Christian church and what you find.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:51.100]   Well you will find invariably during periods of revivals that there have always been what
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.740]   are called phenomena.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.940]   There has never yet been a true spiritual revival but that people have manifested strange
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.500]   feelings.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.900]   Sometimes there have been feelings of awe and alarm but then they've been followed by
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.540]   great joy and ecstasy, invariably.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.700]   It doesn't matter what country, it doesn't matter what century, it doesn't matter when
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.740]   or who the preacher was, it's quite immaterial.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:24.020]   That is invariably in the case of a great revival.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.660]   But what is a revival?
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:32.740]   Well a revival is an unusual activity on the part of the Holy Spirit, an unusually intense
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.180]   activity on the part of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.420]   Yes but it's still the activity of the Spirit.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.340]   The only difference between a normal period in the life of the church and a revival is
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.900]   the difference in the intensity.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:53.220]   It is the same Holy Spirit that brings to conversion one soul in a meeting like this
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.220]   as may bring a hundred in a great period of revival.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.660]   The same Spirit, the same work.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.260]   And the Holy Spirit doesn't change.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:10.340]   The Holy Spirit is the same always as the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.260]   today and forever.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.500]   So is the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:20.500]   And therefore I say that inevitably when he does the same work there must of necessity
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.500]   be the same consequences.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.500]   So that if you look at the teaching of the Word of God, if you substantiate it by the
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:34.380]   teaching of history, I think you are driven to the conclusion that for a man merely to
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:38.540]   say that he believes is not enough.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:47.820]   But the true belief always leads to these further results and has these inevitable consequences.
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:52.180]   Well now, we are considering all that in the case of Saul of Tarsus.
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.060]   We've already considered one of them, that he was astonished.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:06.300]   And he trembling and astonished said, "Lord what wilt thou have me to do?"
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:13.700]   Now having considered his astonishment and the causes of it we come on to the trembling.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:21.220]   And I want to say just this, that as the apostle was astonished, and as all who become truly
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.820]   Christian must know something of this astonishment.
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.380]   I'm not concerned about the degree, but they must know the astonishment in some shape or
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.260]   form as we defined it last Sunday night.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:41.420]   So I am avid that no man can become a Christian without knowing something likewise about this
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.420]   trembling.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:49.940]   Saul of Tarsus trembled.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:55.580]   Again I repeat that everybody who comes becomes a Christian experiences something of this
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:00.660]   trembling, not with the dramatic intensity of Saul perhaps, but it's there, it must be
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.260]   there for these reasons.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:09.100]   Now before I give you those reasons let me say this.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.660]   Let I know as I expound this particular matter I'm saying something which is highly distasteful
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.340]   at this present time.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.700]   Indeed is it going too far to say that the modern man regards this idea of trembling
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.100]   as being quite insulting.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:32.220]   I am speaking of the average person because I know and I welcome the fact that amongst
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:39.620]   those who do read a certain amount of philosophy and of theology there has been a very welcome
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.700]   change in this respect.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.940]   There was a very great Dane who lived just over a hundred years ago, he died just over
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.380]   a hundred years ago, called Kirkagor.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:58.780]   And he at any rate has taught most people this, that without what he calls fear and
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:03.220]   trembling, there is no true Christianity.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.780]   One of his greatest books bore that very title, Fear and Trembling.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.420]   And that idea, thank God, is beginning to come back.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:16.080]   It should never have gone out, as I'm going to show, but it certainly has gone out.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.420]   And the average person regards this as utterly insulting.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:25.740]   He says, "Ah, this is something that belongs to the past."
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.140]   He said people used to be terrified by the gospel, but of course in those days they believed
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.740]   in ghosts.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.020]   They were primitive, they were unintelligent, they hadn't our culture and they were not
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.820]   living in a scientific age.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.820]   They could be alarmed and frightened by all sorts of things, but of course they said times
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:45.380]   have changed, we are no longer in that position and we can't be frightened.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:54.180]   Not only that, they feel that the gospel must be considered only in terms of God's love.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:29:01.020]   And they dislike also the whole idea of justice and of punishment and of retribution and especially
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.860]   the whole conception of the wrath of God.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.820]   I don't think I need waste time over this.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:11.860]   These ideas have become utterly abhorrent to the modern man.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.980]   And he regards a return to this kind of thing as a going back and putting back the clock
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.400]   of time.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:26.760]   And another reason for this is of course that the modern man tends to exalt reason too much.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.820]   And his view of Christianity is that it's just a very reasonable, sensible view of a
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.180]   good life which men can live.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.720]   And that the preaching of the gospel should be just an appeal to people to use common
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.100]   sense and to be reasonable not to do things that are wrong and harmful and to live a good
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.500]   life and to be decent and moral and so on.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.780]   That's his whole conception of Christianity.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:55.180]   So this idea of trembling and of the fear of God he dislikes and utterly abominates.
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.800]   And the result of all this is that they say that they're not going to be frightened into
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.020]   salvation by anybody or by anybody's preaching.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.020]   Well now what is the reply to this?
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.500]   Well let me put it quite simply.
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:16.060]   The last idea I have in my mind as I stand in this pulpit is to frighten anybody into
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:20.420]   salvation for this good reason.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.980]   That my view of salvation is such that I know perfectly well that neither I nor anybody
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.940]   else can ever frighten anybody into salvation.
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.940]   Indeed I go much further.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.300]   I cannot bring anybody to salvation at all.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.300]   It isn't my work.
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.420]   It's the work of God the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:42.260]   I know that I might succeed in frightening people but I can't frighten anybody into salvation.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:46.620]   That is peculiarly the work of the Holy Spirit in regeneration.
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.780]   So that I am entirely free from any desire to attempt to frighten anybody.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.860]   I'll go further.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:59.580]   Not only do I not try to frighten anybody, I think I can say honestly in the presence
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:05.540]   of God I never try to play on people's pleasurable emotions either.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:11.020]   I don't stand here telling stories and tales and being sentimental and thus causing people
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.660]   to weep and in that condition try to press them to Christ.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:20.380]   I do not believe in making a direct approach to the emotions nor to the will.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.260]   I never plead with people to decide for Christ.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.300]   I never invite them to come forward either here or there or anywhere else.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.300]   I don't bring pressure.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   Why not?
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:34.060]   I don't say again this is the work of the Holy Ghost.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.640]   So I'm not concerned about these aspects of the question at all.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:45.300]   My statement is simply this, that the business of the preacher is to present men and women
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.940]   with the truth.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.260]   And I go further.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:32:01.620]   I say that when men and women do see and know and recognize the truth, it will invariably
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:07.420]   and always lead to a certain amount of trembling.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.780]   What was it that made Saul of Tarsus tremble on the road to Damascus?
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.940]   It was the truth.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.180]   The truth about himself.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:19.740]   The truth about that blessed face that he saw there in the heavens looking down upon
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:25.340]   him and the realization of all the consequences.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.660]   My dear friends, my business is simply to hold the truth before you.
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:35.580]   And I say this in addition that if you see it, you will tremble at it as I myself tremble
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.580]   at it.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.140]   I'm not to make you tremble.
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.500]   It's the truth that causes men to tremble.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.300]   And I go further and I say that unless it does, you've not seen it.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:52.060]   Of necessity, as I'm going to show you, it must lead to this consequence.
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:59.260]   But surely this ought to appeal to us all as a general principle.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.740]   How foolish we are sometimes when we think we are being very reasonable.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.180]   A man says, "I'm not going to be frightened."
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:13.340]   But my dear friend, there are certain circumstances and conditions in which you ought to be frightened.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.580]   And if you're not frightened, you're a fool.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.140]   If you are in a house on fire and you didn't know it was on fire and somebody shouted at
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.740]   you, "Look here, if you don't come down quickly, it'll be too late.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.740]   Throw yourself down."
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:29.220]   What if you stood and said, "I'm not going to be frightened by what you say."
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.500]   Is that being sensible or reasonable?
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.980]   Not to be frightened when confronted by certain facts is just foolhardiness.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.580]   If a surgeon tells you that you've got a growth within your body that will kill you unless
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.580]   you allow him to take it out, if you don't pay attention to him and if you're not somewhat
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:52.080]   frightened by his verdict, well, there's only one thing to say, you're a fool.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.020]   You should be frightened by it.
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.500]   If you don't face facts and draw the logical deductions from them, you're being utterly
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:03.060]   irrational.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:09.740]   And my contention is that when a man rarely sees the truth as it is unfolded in this book,
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:14.740]   it is bound to lead to fear and trembling.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:21.140]   Let me establish it again in the same way as I put my original principle tonight.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:27.940]   And incidentally, I'm taking you through this bit of argumentation because I know that this
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:33.660]   kind of thing is so infrequently said today and so unpopular, and yet it's the very truth
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.340]   of the Bible as I see it.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:40.500]   Listen, the Old Testament teaches this everywhere.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.620]   What is the worst thing that the Old Testament has got to say against the ungodly and the
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.620]   irreligious?
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.620]   Isn't it this?
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:53.540]   There is no fear of God before his eyes.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.260]   That's the worst thing it can say about him.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:03.540]   The fool, the unbeliever, the man who's going to perdition, is a man of whom the simple
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.460]   truth is that there is no fear of God before his eyes.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.340]   Or listen to it putting the same thing positively.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:17.620]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.620]   Are you a philosopher?
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.620]   Are you out for wisdom?
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:24.100]   Do you want true understanding with respect to yourself and life and being and everything?
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.420]   Here, says the Bible, is the answer.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:31.860]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.500]   There is no wisdom apart from it.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.180]   Oh yes, says someone, but that's Old Testament.
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.220]   Very well then, let us turn into the New Testament.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.220]   Listen to this.
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.140]   Here is a statement in the New Testament.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:52.260]   It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:36:03.060]   Let us come before him with reverence and godly fear, for our God is a consuming fire.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:08.500]   How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.500]   That's New Testament teaching.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.540]   Oh yes, says someone, but that's out of an epistle.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.540]   And after all, I don't go by these epistles.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.820]   I believe only what Jesus says.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.180]   That's a common statement, isn't it?
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:29.220]   Well listen, go and look at the Lord Jesus Christ as he goes into the presence of God
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.340]   in prayer.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.000]   And listen to what he says.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.660]   This is how he prays.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:43.500]   Holy Father, reverence all godly fear.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.860]   That's how he prayed.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.500]   But listen to his teaching.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.980]   Do you know that five times in the gospel according to St. Matthew, alone, without taking
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:58.860]   in the other gospels, our Lord used this phrase.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:05.300]   He said, "There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:10.500]   The Lord Jesus Christ said that five times in the gospel of Matthew.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:16.620]   The very incarnation of God's love, he whom men put as over against the apostle Paul,
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.300]   he is the one who teaches that.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:25.220]   "There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:32.220]   Oh, there is the teaching, but the examples again confirm it to the very hilt.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.580]   Go back to the very beginning, to the Garden of Eden, and look at Adam and Eve after they've
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.940]   sinned against God.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.940]   What do they do?
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.220]   They hear the voice that they'd heard so often in the cool of the evening, but instead
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.380]   of running to him to greet him, they go and hide themselves.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.380]   Why?
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:51.340]   They're frightened, they're terrified, they're trembling.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:56.380]   Even Abraham, who is the friend of God, we are told that a great fear and terror came
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:02.620]   upon him when God gave him one of his most glorious manifestations.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:08.660]   The psalmist ever cries out for mercy, "Have mercy upon me, O God," he says.
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:13.300]   Look at a favored man like Isaiah when he's given a vision of God and is called to his
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.260]   high prophetic calling.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.300]   What is the effect of it upon him?
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:22.540]   He cries out and says, "I am a man of unclean lips."
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.500]   He sinks to the ground, he's conscious of unworthiness.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.060]   All the prophets teach precisely the same thing.
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:35.660]   Come into the New Testament, look at the father of John the Baptist when he is there doing
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:39.540]   his duty in the temple, and a vision is given to him.
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.540]   And what happens to him?
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:46.220]   He trembles, he was filled with fear as the angel addressed him.
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:51.820]   The same thing happened to the Virgin Mary.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:55.780]   Look at a great Roman official called Felix listening to the preaching of the apostle
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:01.820]   Paul, and what we are told about him is this, that as Paul spake, Felix trembled.
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:05.020]   His knees beat one against another.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.020]   Why?
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:10.500]   Could he be frightened by a prisoner like Paul who was in his power, and yet he trembled?
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.500]   What was it?
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.460]   It was the conviction of the Holy Ghost.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.820]   And look at the Philippian jailer likewise, and how he trembled.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:27.740]   My dear friends, my case is that the realization of the truth of necessity leads to this fear
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.740]   and trembling.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.860]   Well, why does it?
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.020]   Why should it do so?
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:36.580]   Well, the answer is given everywhere in the Bible.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:41.260]   And whether you accept my teaching tonight or not depends entirely upon whether you accept
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.060]   the Bible or not.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:48.420]   If you put up your own ideas about God and about these things, well, of course, you won't
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.380]   possibly agree with what I'm saying.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:56.380]   But for myself, I know nothing about God except what I find in the Bible.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:01.500]   I know nothing about his being, about his ultimate being, save what he has been pleased
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.580]   to reveal.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.580]   And if you claim that you know more or know something different, I ask you, how have you
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.820]   arrived at your knowledge?
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.700]   What sanction have you got for your knowledge?
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.020]   Can you establish it?
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.020]   Can you prove it?
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.020]   Can you demonstrate it?
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.900]   On what is it being based?
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:26.540]   If you believe this, this is what you find.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:35.020]   Religion means coming face to face with God.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:41.980]   What happened to Saul of Tarsus on that road was that he saw the second person in the blessed
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.460]   Holy Trinity.
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:48.340]   The other people saw nothing but a light shining above the brightest shining of the sun at
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.980]   its very noonday height.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:56.620]   They didn't see, but he saw the face and the glory of it all.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:03.100]   And he trembled, as all who come anywhere near to God have invariably and inevitably
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.100]   have trembled.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.460]   What causes the trembling?
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:16.620]   Well, it is first and foremost the majesty and the greatness and the glory and the power
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.620]   of God.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:28.660]   My dear friends, if you've never trembled, it is because you've never really known God.
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:36.020]   We can't conceive of nor even imagine the greatness and the glory and the might and
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.300]   the majesty of God.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.000]   I read with you that nineteenth chapter of the book of Exodus.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.260]   In order that we might have some faint conception of it, you remember the trembling and the
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.380]   fear and the mountain smoking.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.900]   God had come down.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:58.580]   But you get exactly the same thing in the fourteenth chapter of that book of Exodus,
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:05.300]   where God leads his people through the Red Sea and crushes and quills and overwhelms
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.060]   Pharaoh and his hosts.
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:12.700]   You can't read that fourteenth chapter of Exodus without feeling the presence and the
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:17.500]   might and the glory and the majesty of God.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:22.940]   And no one, I say, comes anywhere near God without being conscious of that and trembling.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:31.060]   The very greatness, the might, the marvel of it all will come to the New Testament counterpart.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:36.540]   Did you notice what happened to the apostle Peter on that occasion?
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:40.240]   You read that fifth chapter of Luke's Gospel again and you'll find that at the beginning
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.380]   Peter answers our Lord very pertly.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.580]   He seems ready to argue with him.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:51.380]   And then you see our Lord works a great miracle.
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:56.300]   And the effect of the miracle upon the stout-hearted Peter was this.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:06.660]   He fell at his feet and he said, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:11.620]   I invite you to go through the four Gospels and to read the account of every miracle that
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:17.900]   our Lord ever wrought and you will find that in some shape or form we're always told that
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.380]   the effect of that miracle was that the people were frightened.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.020]   They were filled with a sense of fear.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.300]   They said, "Who is this?
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.760]   We have seen great things today.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.500]   We have seen the mighty power of God."
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.340]   And whenever they felt it and saw it, its effect upon them was to frighten them and
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.340]   to alarm them.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.340]   Why?
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:41.900]   Well, it's a manifestation of power and of glory and of majesty and of might.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:50.900]   My dear friend, any manifestation of power is alarming and it's terrifying.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:55.740]   And that is why any man in his senses is always conscious of a sense of fear when he's in
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:00.340]   the presence of death.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:06.060]   If you can smile at death and say it's nothing, it's because of your ignorance.
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.060]   Death and life.
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.060]   God is present.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.060]   The whole mystery of being.
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:10.060]   It's always alarming and frightening.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:19.460]   The unknown, the unseen, and the glory and the power and the might and the majesty of
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.540]   it all.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:28.220]   And then with this there is the holiness of God.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:38.260]   Saul of Tarsus saw in that face a beauty and a purity and a cleanliness and a holiness
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.660]   such as he'd never seen before.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.460]   And it was blinding.
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.700]   I had occasion to quote this verse this morning.
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:46.700]   I quote it tonight.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.440]   "God is light and in him is no darkness at all."
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.580]   You can't look into the face of the blazing sun at noonday, especially as you go further
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:55.580]   south.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.580]   You have to shield your eyes with glasses.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:58.580]   You can't stand it.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:06.260]   Multiply that by infinity and that's the holiness of God.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.340]   Have you seen yourself?
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:16.260]   He not only saw his smallness and his transitory character and his weakness, he saw his own
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:21.400]   sinfulness.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.660]   And when a man begins to know something about the plague of his own heart and the blackness
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:36.300]   of his own heart, he's filled with a sense of terror and alarm.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:42.420]   There is hell in everybody's heart by nature.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.660]   And the offspring of hell is to be seen there.
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:58.260]   Jealousy, envy, pride, malice, anger, temper, conceit, ambition.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:03.100]   These things, this brood of hell, it's in us every one by nature.
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:09.100]   And if you really could see it, you'd tremble at the thought that such things are in you,
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.660]   but they're there.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.820]   He saw that and it made him tremble.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:21.700]   But I suppose that over and above all this, it was the realization of what would have
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:32.300]   happened to him if he hadn't met this blessed person that made him tremble most of all.
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:36.780]   He thought that he was very godly, very well-pleasing in God's sight.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:42.460]   He thought he was going straight to God and to heaven.
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:50.020]   And he suddenly discovered that he was heading directly for hell.
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:56.060]   And he saw that it was one thing only that saved him from going there.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:04.860]   And that was that this blessed son of God, whom he'd rejected and blasphemed and persecuted,
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:13.980]   had not only loved him, but had even borne the punishment of his sins in his own body
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.420]   on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:27.860]   There, he says, but for the grace of God, go I, as John Bradford said in the sixteenth
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:34.900]   century in Smithfield, as he saw a felon going to death and to damnation.
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:40.660]   There, but for the grace of God, goes John Bradford.
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:47.860]   And this man felt something similar on the road to Damascus.
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:48.860]   What's a Christian?
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:57.700]   Well, what I've been trying to say tonight is just this, that a Christian is one who
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:07.140]   sees clearly that he would undoubtedly have gone to hell and wretchedness and misery and
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:16.380]   perdition, were it not that God's own Son came from heaven to earth and went to the
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:21.860]   cross and gave his life for him.
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:30.500]   A Christian is a man who's looked into hell and who knows that he's been saved from it
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:40.780]   by God's amazing, wondrous love in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:45.140]   Have you known anything of this fear, my friend?
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.500]   You notice I'm not asking you tonight, have you believed in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:52.140]   I've got a much more delicate and sensitive question.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:59.860]   If you truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, this is what it means, that you know that
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:08.900]   you are a hopeless, damned sinner, that you cannot save yourself, that no man can save
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:15.060]   you, that the world cannot save you, that you're under the wrath of God and hopelessly
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.860]   lost and damned and helpless.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:22.140]   That's what believing in Christ means.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:26.060]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
