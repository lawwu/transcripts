[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660]   Whatever reality is, it's not what you see.
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.720]   What you see is just an adaptive fiction.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.920]   - The following is a conversation with Donald Hoffman,
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.920]   professor of cognitive sciences at UC Irvine,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.200]   focusing his research on evolutionary psychology,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.840]   visual perception, and consciousness.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.760]   He's the author of over 120 scientific papers
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.120]   on these topics, and his most recent book titled,
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.240]   "The Case Against Reality,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.720]   "Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes."
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.600]   I think some of the most interesting ideas in this world,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.440]   like those of Donald Hoffman's,
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.640]   attempt to shake the foundation
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.920]   of our understanding of reality,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.320]   and thus, they take a long time to internalize deeply.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.240]   So proceed with caution.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.440]   Questioning the fabric of reality
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.520]   can lead you to either madness or to truth.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.420]   And the funny thing is, you won't know which is which.
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.240]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.420]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.640]   in the description.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.080]   And now, dear friends, here's Donald Hoffman.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.240]   In your book, "The Case Against Reality,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.200]   "Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes,"
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.000]   you make the bold claim that the world we see
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.960]   with our eyes is not real.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560]   It's not even an abstraction of objective reality.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.800]   It is completely detached from objective reality.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.880]   Can you explain this idea?
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.000]   - Right, so this is a theorem from evolution
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.160]   by natural selection.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.540]   So the technical question that I and my team asked was,
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.360]   what is the probability that natural selection
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.360]   would shape sensory systems to see true properties
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.400]   of objective reality?
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.240]   And to our surprise, we found that the answer
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.400]   is precisely zero, except for one kind of structure
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.480]   that we can go into if you want to.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.400]   But for any generic structure that you might think
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.160]   the world might have, a total order, a topology metric,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   the probability is precisely zero that natural selection
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.500]   would shape any sensory system of any organism
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.560]   to see any aspect of objective reality.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.440]   So in that sense, what we're seeing is
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.700]   what we need to see to stay alive long enough to reproduce.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.600]   So in other words, we're seeing what we need
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.440]   to guide adaptive behavior.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.480]   Full stop.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.860]   - So the evolutionary process, the process that took us
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.160]   from the origin of life on Earth to the humans
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.760]   that we are today, that process does not maximize
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.240]   for truth, it maximizes for fitness, as you say.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.280]   Fitness beats truth.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.000]   And fitness does not have to be connected to truth,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.680]   is the claim.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.920]   And that's where you have an approach towards zero
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.920]   of probability that we have evolved human cognition,
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.360]   human consciousness, whatever it is,
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.640]   the magic that makes our mind work,
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.640]   evolved not for its ability to see the truth of reality,
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.160]   but its ability to survive in the environment.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.240]   - That's exactly right.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.200]   So most of us intuitively think that surely
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.600]   the way that evolution will make our senses more fit
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.120]   is to make them tell us more truths,
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.960]   or at least the truths we need to know
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.120]   about objective reality, the truths we need in our niche.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.960]   That's the standard view, and it was the view I took.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.520]   I mean, that's sort of what we're taught
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.840]   or just even assume.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.480]   It's just sort of like the intelligent assumption
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.720]   that we would all make.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.840]   But we don't have to just wave our hands.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.960]   Evolution of a natural selection
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.220]   is a mathematically precise theory.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.200]   John Maynard Smith in the '70s
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.600]   created evolutionary game theory.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.140]   And we have evolutionary graph theory
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.520]   and even genetic algorithms that we can use to study this.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.360]   And so we don't have to wave our hands.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.480]   It's a matter of theorem and proof and/or simulation
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.720]   before you get the theorems and proofs.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.440]   And a couple of graduate students of mine,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.180]   Justin Mark and Brian Marion,
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.960]   did some wonderful simulations that tipped me off
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.480]   that there was something going on here.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.960]   And then I went to a mathematician, Chetan Prakash
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.040]   and Manish Singh and some other friends of mine,
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.440]   Chris Fields.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.000]   But Chetan was the real mathematician behind all this.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.540]   And he's proved several theorems
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.820]   that uniformly indicate that with one exception,
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.920]   which has to do with probability measures,
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.260]   there's no, the probability is zero.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.900]   The reason there's an exception for probability measures,
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.900]   so-called sigma algebras or sigma additive classes,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.760]   is that for any scientific theory,
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.420]   there is the assumption that needs to be made
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.420]   that the whatever structure,
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.760]   whatever probabilistic structure the world may have
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.520]   is not unrelated to the probabilistic structure
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.360]   of our perceptions.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.360]   If they were completely unrelated,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.560]   then no science would be possible.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.600]   So this is technically,
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.080]   the map from reality to our senses
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.040]   has to be a so-called measurable map,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.640]   has to preserve sigma algebras.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.360]   But that means it could be infinite to one
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.340]   and it could collapse all sorts of event information.
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.060]   But other than that, there's no requirement
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.980]   in standard evolutionary theory
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.460]   for fitness payoff functions, for example,
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.580]   to preserve any specific structures of objective reality.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.100]   So you can ask the technical question.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.200]   This is one of the avenues we took.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.940]   If you look at all the fitness payoffs
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.940]   from whatever world structure you might want to imagine,
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.460]   so a world with say a total order on it.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.100]   So it's got N states and they're totally ordered.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.140]   And then you can have a set of maps from that world
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.580]   into a set of payoffs, say from zero to a thousand
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.700]   or whatever you want your payoffs to be.
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.260]   And you can just literally count all the payoff functions
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.140]   and just do the combinatorics and count them.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.820]   Then you can ask a precise question.
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.220]   How many of those payoff functions
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.860]   preserve the total order, if that's what you're looking,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.300]   or how many preserve the topology?
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.800]   And you just count them and divide.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.880]   So the number that are homomorphisms
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.160]   versus the total number, and then take the limit
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.660]   as the number of states in the world
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.960]   and the number of payoff values goes very large.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.580]   And when you do that, you get zero every time.
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.400]   - Okay, there's a million things to ask here.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.920]   But first of all, just in case people are not familiar
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.160]   with your work, let's sort of linger
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.680]   on the big, bold statement here.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.400]   Which is, the thing we see with our eyes
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.040]   is not some kind of limited window into reality.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.860]   It is completely detached from reality.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.600]   Likely completely detached from reality.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.260]   You're saying 100% likely.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:57.560]   Okay, so none of this is real in the way we think is real.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.020]   In the way we have this intuition,
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.020]   there's like this table is some kind of abstraction,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.880]   but underneath it all, there's atoms.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.880]   And there's an entire century of physics
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.020]   that describes the functioning of those atoms
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.720]   and the quarks that make them up.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   There's many Nobel Prizes about particles and fields
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.300]   and all that kind of stuff that slowly builds up
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.200]   to something that's perceivable to us,
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.720]   both with our eyes, with our different senses,
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.960]   as this table.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.560]   Then there's also ideas of chemistry
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   that over layers of abstraction from DNA to embryos,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.960]   to cells that make the human body.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.680]   So all of that is not real.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.320]   - It's a real experience.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.560]   And it's a real adaptive set of perceptions.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.200]   So it's an adaptive set of perceptions, full stop.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.600]   We want to think that-- - So the perceptions are real.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.080]   - So their perceptions are real as perceptions.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.600]   Right, we are having our perceptions,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.900]   but we've assumed that there's a pretty tight relationship
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.940]   between our perceptions and reality.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.680]   If I look up and see the moon,
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.120]   then there is something that exists in space and time
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.920]   that matches what I perceive.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   And all I'm saying is that if you take evolution
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.560]   by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.880]   Our perceptions are there.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.200]   They're there to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.760]   They're not there to show you the truth.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.780]   In fact, the way I think about it is
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.680]   they're there to hide the truth
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.560]   because the truth is too complicated.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.760]   It's just like if you're trying to use your laptop
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.520]   to write an email, right?
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.280]   What you're doing is toggling voltages in the computer.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.640]   But good luck trying to do it that way.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.320]   The reason why we have a user interface
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.640]   is because we don't want to know that quote unquote truth,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.600]   the diodes and resistors and all that terrible hardware.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   If you had to know all that truth,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.000]   your friends wouldn't hear from you.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.360]   So what evolution gave us was perceptions
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.200]   that guide adaptive behavior.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.000]   And part of that process, it turns out,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.680]   means hiding the truth and giving you eye candy.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.700]   - So what's the difference between hiding the truth
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.860]   and forming abstractions,
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.560]   layers upon layers of abstractions
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.080]   over low-level voltages and transistors and chips
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.720]   and programming languages from assembly to Python
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.380]   that then leads you to be able to have an interface
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.000]   like Chrome where you open up another set of JavaScript
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.800]   and HTML programming languages
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.360]   that leads you to have a graphical user interface
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.140]   on which you can then send your friends an email.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   Is that completely detached from the zeros and ones
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.560]   that are firing away inside the computer?
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.880]   - It's not.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.800]   Of course, when I talk about the user interface
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   on your desktop, there's this whole sophisticated
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.120]   backstory to it, right, that the hardware and the software
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.040]   that's allowing that to happen.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.200]   Evolution doesn't tell us the backstory, right?
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.380]   So the theory of evolution is not going to be adequate
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.040]   to tell you what is that backstory.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.120]   It's going to say that whatever reality is,
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.960]   and that's the interesting thing,
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.240]   it says whatever reality is, you don't see it.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.280]   You see a user interface, but it doesn't tell you
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.800]   what that user interface is, how it's built, right?
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   Now we can try to look at certain aspects of the interface,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.040]   but already we're going to look at that and go,
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.920]   okay, before I would look at neurons
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.600]   and I was assuming that I was seeing something
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.800]   that was at least partially true.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.840]   And now I'm realizing that it could be like looking
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.220]   at the pixels on my desktop or icons on my desktop
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.560]   and good luck going from that to the data structures
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.320]   and then the voltages, I mean, good luck.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.920]   There's just no way.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.560]   So what's interesting about this is that
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.960]   our scientific theories are precise enough
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.600]   and rigorous enough to tell us certain limits,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.000]   but, and even limits of the theories themselves,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.200]   but they're not going to tell us what the next move is
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.860]   and that's where scientific creativity comes in.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.920]   So the stuff that I'm saying here, for example,
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.000]   is not alien to physicists.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.640]   The physicists are saying precisely the same thing,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.220]   that space-time is doomed.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.200]   We've assumed that space-time is fundamental.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.320]   We've assumed that for several centuries
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.740]   and it's been very useful.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.940]   So all the things that you were mentioning,
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.900]   the particles and all the work that's been done,
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.080]   that's all been done in space-time,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.480]   but now physicists are saying space-time is doomed.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.680]   There's no such thing as space-time fundamentally
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.040]   in the laws of physics.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.560]   And that comes actually out of gravity
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.920]   together with quantum field theory.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.040]   It just comes right out of it.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.680]   It's a theorem of those two theories put together,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.980]   but it doesn't tell you what's behind it.
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.840]   So the physicists know that their best theories,
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.160]   Einstein's gravity and quantum field theory put together,
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.440]   entail that space-time cannot be fundamental
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.920]   and therefore particles in space-time cannot be fundamental.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.560]   They're just irreducible representations
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.800]   of the symmetries of space-time.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   That's what they are.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.640]   So we have, so space-time, so we put the two together.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.720]   We put together what the physicists are discovering
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.240]   and we can talk about how they do that.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.820]   And then the new discoveries
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.400]   from evolution of natural selection,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.760]   both of these discoveries are really in the last 20 years.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.400]   And what both are saying is space-time has had a good ride.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.360]   It's been very useful.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.520]   Reductionism has been useful, but it's over.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.360]   And it's time for us to go beyond.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.500]   - When you say space-time is doomed,
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.160]   is it the space, is it the time,
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.620]   is it the very hard-coded specification of four dimensions?
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:01.520]   Or are you specifically referring
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.400]   to the kind of perceptual domain that humans operate in,
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.320]   which is space-time?
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.580]   You think like there's a 3D,
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.160]   like our world is three-dimensional
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.400]   and time progresses forward,
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.080]   therefore three dimensions plus one, 4D.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.600]   What exactly do you mean by space-time?
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.840]   (laughing)
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.040]   What do you mean by space-time is doomed?
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:24.880]   - Great, great.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.560]   So this is, by the way, not my quote.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.840]   This is from, for example, Nima Arkani-Hamed
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.720]   at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.320]   Ed Witten, also there.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.520]   David Gross, Nobel Prize winner.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.360]   So this is not just something the cognitive scientists,
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.640]   this is what the physicists are saying.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.100]   - Yeah, the physicists, they're space-time skeptics.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.640]   - Well, yeah, they're saying that,
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.560]   and I can say exactly why they think it's doomed,
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.600]   but what they're saying is that,
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.840]   'cause your question was what aspect of space-time,
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.960]   what are we talking about here?
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.880]   It's both space and time,
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.720]   their union into space-time as in Einstein's theory,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.240]   that's doomed.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.240]   And they're basically saying that even quantum theory,
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.200]   this is Nima Arkani-Hamed especially.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.880]   So Hilbert spaces will not be fundamental either.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.520]   So that the notion of Hilbert space,
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.960]   which is really critical to quantum field theory,
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.960]   quantum information theory,
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.980]   that's not going to figure in the fundamental
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.240]   new laws of physics.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.800]   So what they're looking for
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   is some new mathematical structures beyond space-time,
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.240]   beyond Einstein's four-dimensional space-time
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.000]   or supersymmetric version,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.120]   geometric algebra signature, two comma four kind of,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.240]   there are different ways that you can represent it,
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.520]   but they're finding new structures.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.280]   And then by the way, they're succeeding now.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.400]   They're finding, they found something
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.640]   called the amplituhedron.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.480]   This is Nima and his colleagues,
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.560]   the cosmological polytope.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.360]   These are, so there are these like polytopes,
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.280]   these polyhedra in multi dimensions,
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.280]   generalizations of simplices that are coding for,
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.200]   for example, the scattering amplitudes of processes
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.860]   in the Large Hadron Collider and other colliders.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.000]   So they're finding that if they let go of space-time,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.400]   completely, they're finding new ways of computing
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.480]   these scattering amplitudes that turn literally
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.560]   billions of terms into one term.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.000]   When you do it in space and time,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.760]   because it's the wrong framework,
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.520]   it's just a user interface from,
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.880]   that's not from the evolutionary point of view,
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.120]   it's just user interface.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.560]   It's not a deep insight into the nature of reality.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.920]   So it's missing deep symmetry,
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.980]   it's something called a dual conformal symmetry,
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.900]   which turns out to be true of the scattering data,
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.680]   but you can't see it in space-time,
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.240]   and it's making the computations way too complicated
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.860]   'cause you're trying to compute all the loops
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.280]   and the Feynman diagrams and all the Feynman integrals.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.960]   So see the Feynman approach to the scattering amplitudes
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.480]   is trying to enforce two critical properties of space-time,
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.560]   locality and unitarity.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.400]   And so by, when you enforce those,
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.880]   you get all these loops and multiple,
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.560]   you know, different levels of loops.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.380]   And for each of those,
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.560]   you have to add new terms to your computation.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.040]   But when you do it outside of space-time,
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.760]   you don't have the notion of unitarity,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.720]   you don't have the notion of locality,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.280]   you have something deeper,
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.800]   and it's capturing some symmetries
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.760]   that are actually true of the data.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.960]   And, but then when you look at the geometry
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.340]   of the facets of these polytopes,
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:30.340]   then certain of them will code for unitarity and locality.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.360]   So it actually comes out of the structure
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.480]   of these deep polytopes.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.480]   So what we're finding is there's this whole new world.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.440]   Now, beyond space-time,
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.080]   that is making explicit symmetries
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.960]   that are true of the data
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.000]   that cannot be seen in space-time.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.680]   And that is turning the computations
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.380]   from billions of terms to one or two or a handful of terms.
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.280]   So we're getting insights into symmetries,
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.360]   and all of a sudden the math is becoming simple
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.840]   because we're not doing something silly,
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.020]   we're not adding up all these loops in space-time,
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.800]   we're doing something far deeper.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.080]   But they don't know what this world is about.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.880]   So, they're in an interesting position
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.040]   where we know that space-time is doomed,
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.320]   and I should probably tell you why it's doomed,
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.800]   what they're saying about why it's doomed.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.560]   But they need a flashlight to look beyond space-time.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.380]   What flashlight are we gonna use
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.680]   to look into the dark beyond space-time?
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.240]   Because Einstein's theory and quantum theory
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.900]   can't tell us what's beyond them.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.240]   All they can do is tell us that when you put us together,
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.040]   space-time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.560]   10 to the minus 43 seconds.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.000]   Beyond that, space-time doesn't even make sense.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.040]   It just has no operational definition.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.960]   But it doesn't tell you what's beyond,
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.520]   and so they're just looking for deep structures,
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.660]   like guessing is really fun.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.620]   So these really brilliant guys, generic,
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.920]   brilliant men and women who are doing this work,
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.260]   physicists, are making guesses about these structures,
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.120]   informed guesses, because they're trying to ask,
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.560]   well, okay, what deeper structure could give us
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.360]   the stuff that we're seeing in space-time,
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.960]   but without certain commitments
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.840]   that we have to make in space-time, like locality.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.680]   So they make these brilliant guesses,
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.640]   and of course, most of the time you're gonna be wrong,
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.600]   but once you get one or two, that start to pay off.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.360]   And then you get some lucky breaks.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.060]   So they got a lucky break back in 1986.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.820]   Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.660]   took the scattering amplitude for two gluons coming in
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.560]   at high energy and four gluons going out at low energy,
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.200]   so that kind of scattering thing.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.280]   So apparently for people who are into this,
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.040]   that's sort of something that happens so often,
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.360]   you need to be able to find it and get rid of those,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.160]   'cause you already know about that and you need to,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.280]   so you needed to compute them.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.880]   It was billions of terms, and they couldn't do it,
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.960]   even for the supercomputers couldn't do that
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.560]   for the many billions or millions of times per second
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.400]   they needed to do it.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.040]   So they begged, the experimentalists begged the theorists,
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.280]   please, you gotta.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.140]   And so Park and Taylor took the billions of terms,
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.560]   hundreds of pages, and miraculously,
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.120]   they turned it into nine.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.400]   And then a little bit later,
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.240]   they guessed one term expression
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.480]   that turned out to be equivalent.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.280]   So billions of terms reduced to one term,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.760]   that so-called famous Park-Taylor formula, 1986.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.280]   And that was like, okay, where did that come from?
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.860]   This is a pointer into a deep realm beyond space and time,
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.480]   but no one, I mean, what can you do with it?
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.160]   And they thought maybe it was a one-off,
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.880]   but then other formulas started coming up,
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.000]   and then eventually, Nimar Kani-Hamed
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.240]   and his team found this thing called the Amplituhedron,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.680]   which really sort of captures the whole,
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.640]   a big part of the whole ball of wax.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.880]   I'm sure they would say, no, there's plenty more to do,
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.520]   so I won't say they did it all by any means.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.700]   They're looking at the cosmological polytope as well.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.700]   So what's remarkable to me is that two pillars
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.700]   of modern science, quantum field theory with gravity,
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.920]   on the one hand,
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.540]   and evolution by natural selection on the other.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.080]   Just in the last 20 years have very clearly said,
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.120]   space-time has had a good run,
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.840]   reductionism has been a fantastic methodology.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.720]   So we had a great ontology of space-time,
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.960]   a great methodology of reductionism.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.480]   Now it's time for a new trick.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.040]   With now you need to go deeper and show,
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.960]   but by the way, this doesn't mean we throw away
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.200]   everything we've done, not by a long shot.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.760]   Every new idea that we come up with beyond space-time
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.320]   must project precisely into space-time,
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.000]   and it better give us back everything
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.720]   that we know and love in space-time, or generalizations,
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.820]   or it's not gonna be taken seriously, and it shouldn't be.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.460]   So we have a strong constraint
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.500]   on whatever we're going to do beyond space-time.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.620]   It needs to project into space-time,
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.380]   and whatever this deeper theory is,
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.820]   it may not itself have evolution by natural selection.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.460]   This may not be part of this deeper realm,
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.500]   but when we take whatever that thing is beyond space-time
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.180]   and project it into space-time,
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.740]   it has to look like evolution by natural selection,
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.940]   or it's wrong.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.400]   So that's a strong constraint on this work.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.880]   - So even the evolution by natural selection
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.880]   and quantum field theory could be interfaces
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:11.440]   into something that doesn't look anything like,
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.740]   like you mentioned, I mean, it's interesting to think
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.880]   that evolution might be a very crappy interface
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.360]   into something much deeper.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.200]   - That's right.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.280]   They're both telling us that the framework
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.180]   that you've had can only go so far, and it has to stop,
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.580]   and there's something beyond.
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.100]   And that framework, the very framework
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.200]   that is space and time itself.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.400]   Now, of course, evolution by natural selection
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.960]   is not telling us about, like,
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.340]   Einstein's relativistic space-time.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.340]   So that was another question you asked a little bit earlier.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.420]   It's telling us more about our perceptual space and time,
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.260]   which we have used as the basis
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.700]   for creating first a Newtonian space versus time
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.380]   as a mathematical extension of our perceptions.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.440]   And then Einstein then took that
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.700]   and extended it even further.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.140]   So the relationship between what evolution is telling us
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.020]   and what the physicists are telling us is that,
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.860]   in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space-time
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:11.300]   are formulated as sort of rigorous extensions
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.500]   of our perceptual space, making it mathematically rigorous
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.100]   and laying out the symmetries that they find there.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.740]   So that's sort of the relationship between them.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.460]   So it's the perceptual space-time
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.060]   that evolution is telling us
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.740]   is just a user interface, effectively.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.960]   And then the physicists are finding
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.440]   that even the mathematical extension of that
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.140]   into the Einsteinian formulation has to be, as well,
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.140]   not the final story, there's something deeper.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:43.140]   - So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.900]   As we march forward from Newtonian physics
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   to quantum mechanics, these are all, in your view, interfaces.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:59.260]   Are we getting closer to objective reality?
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.280]   How do we know, if these interfaces,
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.860]   in the process of science,
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.880]   the reason we like those interfaces
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.700]   is because they're predictive of some aspects,
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.160]   strongly predictive about some aspects of our reality.
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.060]   Is that completely deviating
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.560]   from our understanding of that reality,
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.760]   or is it helping us get closer and closer and closer?
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.560]   - Well, of course, one critical constraint
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.220]   on all of our theories is that they are empirically tested
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.800]   and pass the experiments that we have for them.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.440]   So no one's arguing against experiments being important
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.420]   and wanting to test all of our current theories
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.600]   and any new theories on that.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.300]   So that's all there.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.060]   But we have good reason to believe
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.460]   that science will never get a theory of everything.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.600]   - Everything, everything.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.540]   - Everything, everything, right,
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.420]   a final theory of everything, right.
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.140]   I think that my own take is, for what it's worth,
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.620]   is that Gerdl's incompleteness theorem
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.140]   sort of points us in that direction,
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.800]   that even with mathematics,
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.440]   any finite axiomatization that's sophisticated enough
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.060]   to be able to do arithmetic,
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.260]   it's easy to show that there'll be statements that are true,
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.940]   that can't be proven,
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.500]   can't be deduced from within that framework.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.940]   And if you add the new statements to your axioms,
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.300]   then there'll be always new statements that are true,
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.960]   but can't be proven with a new axiom system.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.020]   And the best scientific theories,
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.660]   in physics, for example,
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.100]   and also now evolution, are mathematical.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.340]   So our theories are gonna be,
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.420]   they're gonna have their own assumptions,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.740]   and they'll be mathematically precise.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.840]   And there'll be theories, perhaps,
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.440]   of everything except those assumptions,
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.640]   'cause assumptions are,
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.240]   we say, "Please grant me these assumptions.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.400]   "If you grant me these assumptions,
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.540]   "then I can explain this other stuff."
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.540]   But so you have the assumptions that are like miracles,
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.440]   as far as the theory is concerned, they're not explained,
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.560]   they're the starting points for explanation.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.200]   And then you have the mathematical structure
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.560]   of the theory itself, which will have the Gerdl limits.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.560]   And so my take is that reality, whatever it is,
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:18.600]   is always going to transcend any conceptual theory
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.420]   that we didn't come up with.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.760]   - There's always gonna be mystery at the edges.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.900]   (Lex laughing)
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.740]   - Right.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.380]   - Contradictions and all that kind of stuff.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.220]   Okay.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.860]   And truths.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.840]   So there's this idea that is brought up
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.440]   in the financial space of settlement of transactions,
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.560]   it's often talked about in cryptocurrency especially.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.060]   So you could do, you know, money,
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.640]   cash is not connected to anything.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.180]   It used to be connected to gold, to physical reality,
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:57.180]   but then you can use money to exchange value, to transact.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.760]   So when it was on the gold standard,
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.760]   the money would represent some stable component of reality.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   Isn't it more effective to avoid things like hyperinflation,
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.160]   if we generalize that idea?
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.160]   Isn't it better to connect your,
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.520]   whatever we humans are doing
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.040]   in the social interaction space with each other,
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.000]   isn't it better from an evolutionary perspective
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.040]   to connect it to some degree to reality
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.640]   so that the transactions are settled
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.760]   with something that's universal,
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.920]   as opposed to us constantly operating
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.120]   in something that's a complete illusion?
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.540]   Isn't it easy to hyperinflate that?
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.440]   (Lex laughs)
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.280]   Like where you really deviate very, very far away
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:51.040]   from the underlying reality,
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.760]   or do you never get in trouble for this?
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.240]   Can you just completely drift far, far away
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.600]   from the underlying reality and never get in trouble?
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.840]   - That's a great question.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.760]   On the financial side, there's two levels, at least,
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.920]   that we could take your question.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.840]   One is strictly evolutionary psychology
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.520]   of financial systems, and that's pretty interesting.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.120]   And there, the decentralized idea,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.560]   the DeFi kind of idea in cryptocurrencies
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.960]   may make good sense
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.440]   from just an evolutionary psychology point of view.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.760]   Having human nature being what it is,
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.640]   putting a lot of faith in a few central controllers
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.320]   depends a lot on the veracity of those
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.080]   and trustworthiness of those few central controllers.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.440]   And we have ample evidence time and again
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.880]   that that's often betrayed.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.920]   So it makes good evolutionary sense, I would say,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.680]   to have a decentralized,
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.600]   I mean, democracy is a step in that direction, right?
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.240]   We don't have a monarch now telling us what to do.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.580]   We decentralize things, right?
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.860]   Because if you have Marcus Aurelius as your emperor,
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.140]   you're great, if you have Nero, it's not so great.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.320]   And so we don't want that.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.280]   So democracy is a step in that direction,
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.780]   but I think the DeFi thing is an even bigger step
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:13.140]   and is going to even make the democratization even greater.
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.820]   So that's one level of--
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.500]   - Also, the fact that power corrupts
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.140]   and absolute power corrupts absolutely
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:22.600]   is also a consequence of evolution.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.220]   (laughing)
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.960]   That's also a feature, I think, right?
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.860]   You can argue from the long span of living organisms,
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.820]   it's nice for power to corrupt for you to,
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.780]   so mad men and women throughout history
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.000]   might be useful to teach us a lesson.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.740]   - We can learn from our negative example, right?
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.580]   - Exactly.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.400]   - Right, right.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.040]   Right, so power does corrupt,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.280]   and I think that you can think about that again
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.540]   from an evolutionary point of view.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.780]   But I think that your question was a little deeper,
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:00.780]   when that was, does the evolutionary interface idea
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:06.460]   sort of unhinge science from some kind of important test
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.820]   for the theories, right?
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.320]   We don't want, it doesn't mean that anything goes
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.540]   in scientific theory, but there's no,
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.900]   if we don't see the truth,
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.620]   is there no way to tether our theories and test them?
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.620]   And I think there's no problem there.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.820]   We can only test things in terms of what we can measure
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.540]   with our senses in space and time.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.700]   So we're going to have to continue to do experiments,
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.860]   but we're gonna understand a little bit differently
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.420]   what those experiments are.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.820]   We had thought that when we see a pointer
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.700]   on some machine in an experiment,
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.220]   that the machine exists, the pointer exists,
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.260]   and the values exist even when no one is looking at them,
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.740]   and that they're an object of truth.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.460]   And our best theorists are telling us, no,
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.460]   the pointers are just pointers,
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.140]   and that's what you have to rely on
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.860]   for making your judgments.
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.620]   But even the pointers themselves
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.420]   are not the objective reality.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.540]   So, and I think Gödel is telling us that,
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.700]   not that anything goes, but as you develop
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.700]   new axiom systems, you will find out what goes
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.580]   within that axiom system,
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.660]   and what testable predictions you can make.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.740]   So I don't think we're untethered.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.940]   We continue to do experiments.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.140]   What I think we won't have that we want
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.620]   is a conceptual understanding that gives us
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.500]   a theory of everything that's final and complete.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.260]   I think that this is, to put it another way,
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.060]   this is job security for scientists.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.180]   Our job will never be done,
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.700]   it's job security for neuroscience.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.020]   Because before we thought that when we looked
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.420]   in the brain, we saw neurons and neural networks
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:57.420]   and action potentials and synapses and so forth,
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.320]   and that was it, that was the reality.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.740]   Now we have to reverse engineer that.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.760]   We have to say, what is beyond space-time?
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.620]   What is going on?
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.380]   What is a dynamical system beyond space-time?
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.500]   That when we project it into Einstein's space-time,
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.340]   gives us things that look like neurons
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.140]   and neural networks and synapses.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.500]   So we have to reverse engineer it.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.020]   So there's gonna be lots more work for neuroscience.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.900]   It's gonna be far more complicated
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.880]   and difficult and challenging.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.060]   But that's wonderful, that's what we need to do.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.420]   We thought neurons exist when they are perceived
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.360]   and they don't.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.060]   In the same way that if I show you,
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.480]   when I say they don't exist, I should be very, very concrete.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.380]   If I draw on a piece of paper a little sketch
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.540]   of something that is called the Necker cube,
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.860]   it's just a little line drawing of a cube, right?
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.020]   It's on a flat piece of paper.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.180]   If I execute it well and I show it to you,
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.380]   you'll see a 3D cube and you'll see it flip.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.780]   Sometimes you'll see one face in front,
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.920]   sometimes you'll see the other face in front.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.360]   But if I ask you, which face is in front
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.360]   when you don't look?
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.580]   The answer is, well, neither face is in front
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.340]   'cause there's no cube.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.220]   There's just a flat piece of paper.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.100]   So when you look at the piece of paper,
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.420]   you perceptually create the cube.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.500]   And when you look at it, then you fix one face
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.100]   to be in front and one face to be.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.980]   So that's what I mean when I say it doesn't exist.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.140]   Space-time itself is like the cube.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.980]   It's a data structure that your sensory systems construct,
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.740]   whatever your sensory systems mean now,
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.340]   'cause we now have to even take that for granted.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:31.380]   But there are perceptions that you construct on the fly
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.980]   and they're data structures in a computer science sense
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.700]   and you garbage collect them when you don't need them.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.500]   So you create them and garbage collect them.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.860]   - But is it possible that it's mapped well
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:45.620]   in some concrete, predictable way to objective reality,
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.620]   the sheet of paper, this two-dimensional space,
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.220]   or we can talk about space-time,
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.840]   maps in some way that we maybe don't yet understand,
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.600]   but will one day understand what that mapping is,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.940]   but it maps reliably, it is tethered in that way.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.780]   - Well, yes.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.220]   And so the new theories that the physicists are finding
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.100]   beyond space-time have that kind of tethering.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.540]   So they show precisely how you start
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.780]   with an amplitude hedron
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.260]   and how you project this high-dimensional structure
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.300]   into the four dimensions of space-time.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.300]   So there's a precise procedure that relates the two.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.820]   And they're doing the same thing
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.140]   with the cosmological polytopes.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.740]   So they're the ones that are making the most concrete
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.700]   and fun advances going beyond space-time.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.180]   And they're tethering it, right?
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.420]   They say this is precisely the mathematical projection
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.580]   from this deeper structure into space-time.
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.620]   One thing I'll say about, as a non-physicist,
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.620]   what I find interesting is that they're finding
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:51.140]   just geometry, but there's no notion of dynamics.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.980]   Right now, they're just finding
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:57.420]   these static geometric structures, which is impressive.
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.820]   So I'm not putting them down.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.140]   What they're doing is unbelievably complicated
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:06.140]   and brilliant and adventurous.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.260]   All those things.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.700]   - And beautiful from a human aesthetic perspective
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.900]   'cause geometry is beautiful.
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.140]   - It's absolutely.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.380]   And they're finding symmetries that are true of the data
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.660]   that can't be seen in space-time.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.940]   But I'm looking for a theory beyond space-time
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.420]   that's a dynamical theory.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.500]   I would love to find, and we can talk about that
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.540]   at some point, a theory of consciousness
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.100]   in which the dynamics of consciousness itself
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.500]   will give rise to the geometry
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.940]   that the physicists are finding beyond space-time.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.420]   If we can do that, then we'd have a completely different way
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.620]   of looking at how consciousness is related
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.300]   to what we call the brain or the physical world
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.260]   more generally.
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.620]   Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues,
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.900]   99% of them are trying to,
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.700]   they're assuming space-time is fundamental.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.180]   They're assuming that particles are fundamental,
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.140]   quarks, gluons, leptons, and so forth.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.060]   Elements, atoms, and so forth are fundamental,
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.420]   and that therefore neurons and brains
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.780]   are part of objective reality.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.900]   And that somehow when you get matter
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.660]   that's complicated enough,
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.260]   it will somehow generate conscious experiences
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.860]   by its functional properties.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.380]   Or if you're a panpsychist,
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:22.700]   maybe in addition to the physical properties of particles,
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:27.260]   you add consciousness property as well.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.900]   And then you combine these physical and conscious properties
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.220]   to get more complicated ones.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.740]   But they're all doing it within space-time.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:38.980]   All of the work that's being done on consciousness
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.900]   and its relationship to the brain
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.020]   is all assumed something that our best theories
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.820]   are telling us is doomed, space-time.
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.500]   - Why does that particular assumption bother you the most?
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.120]   So you bring up space-time.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:57.020]   I mean, that's just one useful interface
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.740]   we've used for a long time.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.780]   Surely there's other interfaces.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.540]   Is space-time just one of the big ones
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.380]   to build up people's intuition about the fact
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.380]   that they do assume a lot of things strongly?
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:15.060]   Or is it in fact a fundamental flaw
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.580]   in the way we see the world?
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:20.660]   - Well, everything else that we think we know
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.900]   are things in space-time.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.260]   - Sure.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.780]   - And so when you say space-time is doomed,
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:32.780]   this is a shot to the heart of the whole framework,
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.940]   the whole conceptual framework that we've had in science.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.700]   Not to the scientific method,
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.820]   but to the fundamental ontology
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.420]   and also the fundamental methodology,
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.740]   the ontology of space-time and its contents
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.340]   and the methodology of reductionism,
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:51.940]   which is that as we go to smaller scales in space-time,
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.140]   we will find more and more fundamental laws.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:59.440]   And that's been very useful for space and time for centuries,
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.420]   reductionism for centuries,
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.700]   but now we realize that that's over.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.700]   Reductionism is in fact dead as is space-time.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.580]   - What exactly is reductionism?
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.140]   What is the process of reductionism
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:17.620]   that is different than some of the physicists
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.440]   that you mentioned that are trying to think,
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.060]   trying to let go of the assumption of space-time?
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.540]   Like beyond, isn't that still trying to come up
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.340]   with a simple model that explain this whole thing?
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.380]   Isn't it still reducing?
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.220]   - It's a wonderful question
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.120]   because it really helps to clarify two different notions,
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.500]   which is scientific explanation on the one hand
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.380]   and a particular kind of scientific explanation
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.860]   on the other, which is the reductionist.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.260]   So the reductionist explanation is saying,
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.500]   I will start with things that are smaller in space-time
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.300]   and therefore more fundamental
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.060]   where the laws are more fundamental.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.880]   So we go to just smaller and smaller scales.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.000]   Whereas in science more generally,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.500]   we just say like when Einstein
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   did the special theory of relativity,
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.600]   he's saying, let me have a couple postulates.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.140]   I will assume that the speed of light is universal
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:11.140]   for all observers in uniform motion
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.360]   and that the laws of physics,
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.780]   so if you're for uniform motion are,
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.140]   that's not a reductionist.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.020]   Those are saying, grant me these assumptions.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.380]   I can build this entire concept of space-time out of it.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.580]   It's not a reductionist thing.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.780]   You're not going to smaller and smaller scales of space.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.620]   You're coming up with these deep, deep principles.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.140]   Same thing with this theory of gravity.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.660]   It's the falling elevator idea.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.620]   So this is not a reductionist kind of thing.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.820]   It's something different.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.820]   - So simplification is a bigger thing than just reductionism.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.780]   - Reductionism has been a particularly useful
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.580]   kind of scientific explanation,
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.140]   for example, in thermodynamics.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.420]   The notion that we have of heat,
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.700]   some macroscopic thing like temperature and heat.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.620]   It turns out that Neil Boltzmann and others discovered,
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.980]   well, hey, if we go to smaller and smaller scales,
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.460]   we find these things called molecules or atoms.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.420]   And if we think of them as bouncing around
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.660]   and having some kind of energy,
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:13.660]   then what we call heat really can be reduced to that.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:19.060]   And so that's a particularly useful kind of reduction,
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.340]   is a useful kind of scientific explanation
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.460]   that works within a range of scales within space-time.
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.420]   But we know now precisely where that has to stop.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.220]   At 10 to the minus 33 centimeters
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.740]   and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.340]   And I would be impressed
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.500]   if it was 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.500]   I'm not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.580]   (Lex laughing)
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:44.900]   - I don't even know how to comprehend
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.340]   either of those numbers, frankly.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:51.500]   Just a small aside, 'cause I am a computer science person,
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.140]   I also find cellular automata beautiful.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.820]   And so you have somebody like Stephen Wolfram,
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:01.540]   who recently has been very excitedly exploring
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.020]   a proposal for a data structure that could be
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.420]   the numbers that would make you a little bit happier
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.260]   in terms of scale,
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.720]   'cause they're very, very, very, very tiny.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.500]   So do you like this space of exploration,
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.620]   of really thinking, letting go of space-time,
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.580]   letting go of everything,
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.660]   and trying to think what kind of data structures
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.780]   could be underneath this whole mess?
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.620]   - That's right.
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.800]   If they're thinking about these as outside of space-time,
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.100]   then that's what we have to do.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.580]   That's what our best theories are telling us.
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.580]   You now have to think outside of space-time.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.540]   Now, of course, I should back up and say,
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.380]   we know that Einstein surpassed Newton, right?
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.980]   But that doesn't mean that there's not good work
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.940]   to do on Newton.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.300]   There's all sorts of Newtonian physics
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.220]   that takes us to the moon and so forth,
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.240]   and there's lots of good problems
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.980]   that we want to solve with Newtonian physics.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.180]   The same thing will be true of space-time.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.980]   It's not like we're gonna stop using space-time.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.420]   We'll continue to do all sorts of good work there.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.700]   But for those scientists who are really looking
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:04.260]   to go deeper, to actually find the next,
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.160]   just like what Einstein did to Newton,
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.440]   what are we gonna do to Einstein?
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.780]   How do we get beyond Einstein and quantum theory
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:10.900]   to something deeper?
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.260]   Then we have to actually let go.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.780]   And if we're gonna do this automata kind of approach,
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.180]   it's critical that it's not automata in space-time,
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.580]   it's automata prior to space-time
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.860]   from which we're gonna show how space-time emerges.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.200]   If you're doing automata within space-time,
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.580]   well, that might be a fun model,
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.080]   but it's not the radical new step that we need.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.700]   - Yeah, so the space-time emerges from that whatever system,
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.540]   like you're saying, it's a dynamical system.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.460]   Do we even have an understanding what dynamical means
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.720]   when we go beyond?
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.020]   When you start to think about dynamics,
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.340]   it could mean a lot of things.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.940]   Even causality could mean a lot of things
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.760]   if we realize that everything's an interface.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.420]   How much do we really know is an interesting question,
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.540]   'cause you brought up neurons,
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.440]   I gotta ask you yet another tangent.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.900]   There's a paper I remember a while ago looking at
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.500]   called Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.180]   And I just enjoyed that thought experiment
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.740]   that they provided, which is they basically,
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.860]   it's a couple of neuroscientists,
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.300]   Eric Jonas and Conrad Kording,
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.840]   who use the tools of neuroscience
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   to analyze a microprocessor, so a computer chip.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.220]   - Yeah, if we lesion it here, what happens and so forth,
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.540]   and if you go and lesion a computer,
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:38.300]   it's very, very clear that lesion experiments on computers
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.420]   are not gonna give you a lot of insight into how it works.
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.660]   - And also the measurement devices and the kind of,
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.540]   just using the basic approaches of neuroscience,
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.140]   collecting the data, trying to intuit
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.420]   about the underlying function of it.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.540]   And that helps you understand that
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.900]   our scientific exploration of concepts,
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.360]   depending on the field,
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:05.020]   are maybe in the very, very early stages.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.500]   I wouldn't say it leads us astray,
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.860]   perhaps it does sometimes, but it's not a,
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.660]   it's not anywhere close to some fundamental mechanism
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.460]   that actually makes a thing work.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.940]   - I don't know if you can sort of comment on that
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.060]   in terms of using neuroscience to understand
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.180]   the human mind and neurons.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.340]   Are we really far away, potentially,
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.540]   from understanding in the way we understand
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:33.700]   the transistors enough to be able to build a computer?
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.940]   So one thing about understanding
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.580]   is you can understand for fun.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:45.580]   The other one is to understand so you could build things.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.200]   And that's when you really have to understand.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.980]   - Exactly.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.260]   In fact, what got me into the field that I,
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.620]   at MIT, was work by David Marr on this very topic.
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:59.820]   So David Marr was a professor at MIT,
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.060]   but he'd done his PhD in neuroscience,
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.340]   studying just the architectures of the brain.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.680]   But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:15.020]   He realized that his work, as rigorous as it was,
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.140]   left him unsatisfied because he didn't know
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.580]   what the cerebellum was for.
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.740]   And why it had that architecture.
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.540]   So he went to MIT and he was in the AI lab there.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:29.660]   And he said he had this three-level approach
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.740]   that really grabbed my attention.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.700]   So when I was an undergrad at UCLA,
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.740]   I read one of his papers in a class and said,
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.580]   "Who is this guy?"
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.420]   Because he said, "You have to have a computational theory.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.060]   "What is being computed and why?"
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:42.420]   An algorithm, how is it being computed?
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.820]   What are the precise algorithms?
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.940]   And then the hardware,
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:47.820]   how does it get instantiated in the hardware?
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.380]   And so to really do neuroscience, he argued,
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.780]   we needed to have understanding at all those levels.
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.420]   And that really got me.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.380]   I loved the neuroscience, but I realized
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.440]   this guy was saying, "If you can't build it,
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.060]   "you don't understand it effectively."
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.020]   And so that's why I went to MIT.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.500]   And I had the pleasure of working with David
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.760]   until he died just a year and a half later.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:12.780]   So there's been that idea that with neuroscience,
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.900]   we have to have, in some sense, a top-down model
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.940]   of what's being computed and why
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.020]   that we would then go after.
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.500]   And the same thing with the,
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.220]   trying to reverse engineer a computing system
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.520]   like your laptop.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.540]   We really need to understand what the user interface
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.160]   is about and why we have,
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.260]   what are keys on the keyboard for and so forth.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.460]   You need to know why to really understand
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.340]   all the circuitry and what it's for.
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:45.340]   Now, we don't, evolution of natural selection
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:51.580]   does not tell us the deeper question that we're asking,
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.660]   the answer to the deeper question, which is why.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:58.660]   What's this deeper reality and what's it up to and why?
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:03.200]   All it tells us is that whatever reality is,
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.500]   it's not what you see.
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.740]   What you see is just an adaptive fiction.
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:15.420]   - So just to linger on this fascinating, bold question
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.980]   that shakes you out of your dream state.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:23.420]   Does this fiction still help you in building intuitions
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.800]   as literary fiction does about reality?
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.260]   The reason we read literary fiction
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:34.740]   is it helps us build intuitions
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.220]   and understanding in indirect ways,
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:40.300]   sneak up to the difficult questions of human nature.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.900]   Great fiction.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.460]   Same with this observed reality.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:49.180]   Does this interface that we get, this fictional interface,
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.820]   help us build intuition about deeper truths
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.020]   of how this whole mess works?
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.900]   - Well, I think that each theory that we propose
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.100]   will give its own answer to that question, right?
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:05.300]   So when the physicists are proposing these structures
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.260]   like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytope,
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:11.100]   associahedron and so forth, beyond space-time,
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.220]   we can then ask your question for those specific structures
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:17.620]   and say, how much information, for example,
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.240]   does evolution by natural selection
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:24.240]   and the kinds of sensory systems that we have right now
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.940]   give us about this deeper reality?
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:30.000]   And why did we evolve this way?
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.020]   We can try to answer that question from within the deep.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.940]   So there's not gonna be a general answer.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.760]   I think what we'll have to do
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.380]   is posit these new deeper theories
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.480]   and then try to answer your question
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.580]   within the framework of those deeper theories,
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.140]   knowing full well that there'll be an even deeper theory.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.860]   - So is this paralyzing though?
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.340]   'Cause how do we know we're not completely adrift
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:57.700]   out to sea, lost forever from,
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.080]   so like that our theory is a completely lost.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.980]   So if it's all,
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:07.940]   if we can never truly, deeply introspect to the bottom,
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:12.000]   if it's always just turtles on top of turtles infinitely,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.360]   isn't that paralyzing for a scientific mind?
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.320]   - Well, it's interesting that you say
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.160]   introspect to the bottom.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.160]   (Lex laughs)
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.480]   Because there is that, there is one,
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.260]   I mean, again, this is in the same spirit
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:29.100]   of what I said before,
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.020]   which is it depends on what answer you give
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.820]   to what's beyond space-time,
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.220]   what answer we would give to your question, right?
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:39.700]   So, but one answer that is interesting to explore
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.020]   is something that spiritual traditions
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.580]   have said for thousands of years,
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:43.680]   but haven't said precisely.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.900]   So we can't take it seriously in science
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:46.940]   until it's made precise,
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.140]   but we might be able to make it precise.
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:53.180]   And that is that they've also said something like
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.820]   space and time aren't fundamental,
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.820]   they're maya, they're illusion.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:01.340]   And, but that if you look inside, if you introspect
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.900]   and let go of all of your particular perceptions,
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:10.340]   you will come to something that's beyond conceptual thought.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:15.340]   And that is, they claim,
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.580]   being in contact with the deep ground of being
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.220]   that transcends any particular conceptual understanding.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.260]   If that is correct, now I'm not saying it's correct,
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.020]   but, and I'm not saying it's not correct.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.340]   I'm just saying, if that's correct,
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.740]   then it would be the case that as scientists,
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.100]   because we also are in touch with this ground of being,
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:38.360]   we would then not be able to conceptually understand
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.140]   ourselves all the way,
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.540]   but we could know ourselves just by being ourselves.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:47.260]   And so we would, there would be a sense in which
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.820]   there is a fundamental grounding to the whole enterprise
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.300]   because we're not separate from the enterprise.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.380]   This is the opposite of the impersonal third-person science.
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.220]   This would make science go--
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.220]   - You'd be personal.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.640]   - Personal all the way down.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.020]   And, but nevertheless, scientific,
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.180]   because the scientific method would still be
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.340]   what we would use all the way down
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.500]   for the conceptual understanding.
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.460]   - Unfortunately, you still don't know
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.780]   if you went all the way down.
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.940]   It's possible that this kind of whatever consciousness is,
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.940]   and we'll talk about it, is getting
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:22.700]   the cliche statement of be yourself.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:28.540]   It is somehow digging at a deeper truth of reality,
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:31.740]   but you still don't know when you get to the bottom.
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:34.460]   You know, a lot of people, they'll take psychedelic drugs,
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.980]   and they'll say, well, that takes my mind to certain places
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:41.120]   where it feels like that is revealing
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.100]   some deeper truth of reality.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.860]   But you still, it could be interfaces on top of interfaces.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:51.860]   That's, in your view of this, you really don't know.
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.100]   - That means Gato's incompleteness
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.620]   is that you really don't know.
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:58.480]   - My own view on it, for what it's worth,
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.700]   'cause I don't know the right answer,
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:05.700]   but my own view on it right now is that it's never ending.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.380]   I think that there will never, that this is great,
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:12.040]   as I said before, great job security for science,
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.860]   and that we, if this is true,
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.580]   and if consciousness is somehow important
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.020]   or fundamental in the universe,
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.620]   this may be an important fundamental fact
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:21.980]   about consciousness itself,
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.080]   that it's a never-ending exploration
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.500]   that's going on in some sense.
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.100]   - Well, that's interesting,
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.900]   push back on the job security.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:32.740]   - Okay.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:37.500]   - So maybe as we understand this kind of idea
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.900]   deeper and deeper, we understand that the pursuit
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.940]   is not a fruitful one.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.920]   Then maybe we need to, maybe that's why
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.400]   we don't see aliens everywhere,
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.260]   is you get smarter and smarter and smarter,
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:55.580]   you realize that exploration is,
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:59.260]   there's other fun ways to spend your time than exploring.
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:03.980]   You could be sort of living maximally
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.860]   in some way that's not exploration.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:10.020]   There's all kinds of video games you can construct
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.820]   and put yourself inside of them
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.740]   that don't involve you going outside of the game world.
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.720]   Feeling, from my human perspective,
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.960]   what seems to be fun is challenging yourself
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.640]   and overcoming those challenges,
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.720]   so you can constantly artificially generate
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:28.000]   challenges for yourself, like Sisyphus and his boulder.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.260]   And that's it, so the scientific method
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.000]   that's always reaching out to the stars,
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.160]   that's always trying to figure out
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:36.880]   the puzzle upon a puzzle,
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.520]   that's always trying to get to the bottom turtle.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.960]   Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.180]   that that's an infinite pursuit,
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:51.120]   we agree to start deviating from that pursuit,
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.160]   start enjoying the here and now
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.560]   versus the looking out into the unknown always.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.960]   Maybe that's looking out into the unknown
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.960]   is a early activity for a species that's evolved.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:09.800]   I'm just sort of saying, pushing back,
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.160]   'cause you probably got a lot of scientists excited
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.600]   in terms of job security,
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.760]   I could envision where it's not job security,
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.740]   where scientists become more and more useless.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:25.440]   Maybe they're like the holders of the ancient wisdom
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:29.640]   that allows us to study our own history,
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.280]   but not much more than that.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.120]   Just to--
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.640]   - That's good pushback.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.320]   I'll put one in there for the scientists again.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.720]   But sure, but then I'll take the other side too.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:46.680]   So when Faraday did all of his experiments
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.280]   with magnets and electricity and so forth,
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.040]   came with all this wonderful empirical data
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.120]   and James Clerk Maxwell looked at it
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.120]   and wrote down a few equations,
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.200]   which we can now write down in a single equation,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.040]   the Maxwell equation,
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.400]   if we use geometric algebra, just one equation.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:07.440]   That opened up unbelievable technologies.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.480]   People are zooming and talking to each other
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.360]   around the world.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.640]   The whole electronics industry,
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.120]   there was something that transformed our lives
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.440]   in a very positive way.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.800]   With the theories beyond space time,
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.860]   here's one potential.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:28.820]   Right now, most of the galaxies that we see,
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:32.600]   we can see them, but we know that we could never get to them
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.160]   no matter how fast we traveled.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.560]   They're going away from us at the speed of light or beyond,
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.320]   so we can't ever get to them.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.760]   So there's all this beautiful real estate
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.720]   that's just smiling and waving at us
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.880]   and we can never get to it.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.400]   But that's if we go through space time.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.880]   But if we recognize that space time
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.780]   is just a data structure, it's not fundamental.
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:56.080]   We're not little things inside space time.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:00.240]   Space time was a little data structure in our perceptions.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.120]   It's just the other way around.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.440]   Once we understand that and we get equations
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.400]   for the stuff that's beyond space time,
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.640]   maybe we won't have to go through space time.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.800]   Maybe we can go around it.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.280]   Maybe I can go to Proxima Centauri and not go through space.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.800]   I can just go right there directly.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.640]   It's a data structure.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.320]   We can start to play with it.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:23.600]   So I think that for what it's worth,
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   my take would be that the endless sequence of theories
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:32.880]   that we could contemplate building
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:37.880]   will lead to an endless sequence of new remarkable insights
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:41.520]   into the potentialities, the possibilities
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.000]   that would seem miraculous to us
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.600]   and that we will be motivated to continue the exploration
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.240]   partly just for the technological innovations
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.920]   that come out.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:56.200]   But the other thing that you mentioned, though,
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.840]   what about just being?
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.480]   What if we decide instead of all this doing
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.360]   and exploring, what about being?
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.680]   My guess is that the best scientists will do both
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:11.680]   and that the act of being will be a place
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.920]   where they get many of their ideas
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.800]   and that they then pull into the conceptual realm.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:21.040]   And I think many of the best scientists,
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.160]   Einstein comes to mind, right?
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.400]   Where these guys say, look, I didn't come up
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.640]   with these ideas by a conceptual analysis.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.240]   I was thinking in vague images
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:34.040]   and it was just something non-conceptual.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.040]   And then it took me a long, long time
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.120]   to pull it out into concepts
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.680]   and then longer to put it into math.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:44.440]   But the real insights didn't come from just slavishly
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.720]   playing with equations.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.320]   They came from a deeper place.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.600]   And so there may be this going back and forth
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.680]   between the complete non-conceptual
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.640]   where there's essentially no end to the wisdom
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.800]   and then conceptual systems
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.200]   where there's the girdle limits that we have to that.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.480]   And that may be, if consciousness is important
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.600]   and fundamental, that may be what consciousness,
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:09.360]   at least part of what consciousness is about
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.880]   is this discovering itself,
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.040]   discovering its possibilities, so to speak.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.000]   We can talk about what that might mean
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.240]   by going from the non-conceptual
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.160]   to the conceptual and back and forth.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.440]   - To get better and better and better at being.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.860]   Right, let me ask you, just to linger on the evolutionary,
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:33.160]   because you mentioned evolutionary game theory
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.280]   and that's really where you,
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.040]   the perspective from which you come
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:40.200]   to form the case against reality.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:45.360]   At which point in our evolutionary history
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.520]   did we start to deviate the most from reality?
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:54.520]   Is it way before life even originated on Earth?
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   Is it in the early development from bacteria and so on?
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:05.080]   Or is it when some inklings
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.760]   of what we think of as intelligence
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.760]   or maybe even complex consciousness started to emerge?
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.840]   So where did this deviation,
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.520]   just like with the interfaces in a computer,
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.920]   you start with transistors and then you have assembly
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.200]   and then you have C, C++,
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.760]   then you have Python, then you have GUIs,
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.480]   all that kind, you have layers upon layers.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.320]   When did we start to deviate?
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   - Well, David Marr, again, my advisor at MIT,
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.920]   in his book Vision,
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:42.360]   suggested that the more primitive sensory systems
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.800]   were less realistic, less veridical,
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.000]   but that by the time you got to something
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.240]   as complicated as the humans,
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:51.600]   we were actually estimating the true shapes
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.360]   and distances to objects and so forth.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:57.040]   So his point of view, and I think it was probably,
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.600]   it's not an uncommon view among my colleagues,
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:06.160]   that yeah, the sensory systems of lower creatures
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.560]   may just not be complicated enough
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:10.000]   to give them much truth.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.840]   But as you get to 86 billion neurons,
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.080]   you can now compute the truth,
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:17.080]   or at least the parts of the truth that we need.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.220]   When I look at evolutionary game theory,
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.100]   one of my graduate students, Justin Mark,
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:27.700]   did some simulations using genetic algorithms.
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:30.620]   So there, he was just exploring,
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.140]   we start off with random organisms,
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:36.340]   random sensory genetics and random actions,
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.500]   and the first generation was unbelievably,
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.700]   it was a foraging situation,
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:41.300]   they were foraging for resources.
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:44.140]   Most of them stayed in one place,
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.640]   didn't do anything important.
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:51.140]   But we could then just look at how the genes evolved,
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.260]   and what we found was,
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:59.420]   what he found was that basically you never even saw
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:04.840]   the truth organisms even come on the stage.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.820]   If they came, they were gone in one generation,
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.420]   they just weren't.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:14.420]   So they came and went, even just in one generation.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.300]   They just are not good enough.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.980]   The ones that were just tracking,
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:20.860]   their senses just were tracking the fitness payoffs,
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:25.860]   were far more fit than the truth seekers.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.500]   So an answer at one level,
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.820]   I'm gonna give an answer at a deeper level,
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.220]   but just with evolutionary game theory.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.300]   Because my attitude as a scientist is,
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.100]   I don't believe any of our theories.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.280]   I take them very, very seriously, I study them,
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.340]   I look at their implications,
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.900]   but none of them are the gospel,
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.020]   they're just the latest ideas that we have.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.620]   So the reason I study evolutionary game theory
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.060]   is because that's the best tool we have
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.060]   right now in this area.
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.340]   There is nothing else that competes.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.580]   And so as a scientist, it's my responsibility
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.060]   to take the best tools and see what they mean.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.820]   And the same thing the physicists are doing,
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.860]   they're taking the best tools
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.260]   and looking at what they entail.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:11.700]   But I think that science now has enough experience
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:14.980]   to realize that we should not believe our theories,
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.960]   in the sense that we've now arrived.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.400]   In 1890, it was a lot of physicists thought we'd arrived.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.640]   They were discouraging bright young students
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.800]   from going into physics 'cause it was all done.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.960]   And that's precisely the wrong attitude.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.520]   Forever, it's the wrong attitude forever.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.600]   The attitude we should have is, a century from now,
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.560]   they'll be looking at us and laughing
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.720]   at what we didn't know.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.120]   And we just have to assume that that's going to be the case.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.060]   Just know that everything that we think
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.260]   is so brilliant right now, our final theory.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.840]   A century from now, they'll look at us
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.120]   like we look at the physicists of 1890
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.200]   and go, how could they have been so dumb?
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.960]   So I don't wanna make that mistake.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.800]   So I'm not doctrinaire about
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.920]   any of our current scientific theories.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.280]   I'm doctrinaire about this.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.960]   We should use the best tools we have right now.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.040]   That's what we've got. - And with humility.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.600]   Well, so let me ask you about game theory.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.940]   I love game theory, evolutionary game theory.
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:22.600]   But I'm always suspicious of it, like economics.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.940]   When you construct models, it's too easy
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.500]   to construct things that oversimplify
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:34.420]   just because we, our human brains,
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:39.040]   enjoy the simplification of constructing a few variables
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.100]   that somehow represent organisms or represent people
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.600]   and running a simulation that then allows you
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.440]   to build up intuition and it feels really good
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.420]   because you can get some really deep
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:51.980]   and surprising intuitions.
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.260]   But how do you know your models aren't,
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.200]   the assumptions underlying your models
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.880]   aren't some fundamentally flawed
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.720]   and because of that, your conclusions
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.020]   are fundamentally flawed.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:06.220]   So I guess my question is, what are the limits
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.840]   in your use of game theory, evolutionary game theory,
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.480]   your experience with it, what are the limits of game theory?
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.780]   - So I've gotten some pushback from professional colleagues
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.340]   and friends who have tried to rerun simulations
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.840]   and try to, the idea that we don't see the truth
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.220]   is not comfortable and so many of my colleagues
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.420]   are very interested in trying to show that we're wrong.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.600]   And so the idea would be to say that somehow
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.540]   we did something, as you're suggesting,
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.740]   maybe something special that wasn't completely general.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.980]   We got some little special part of the whole search space
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.180]   in evolutionary game theory in which this happens
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:41.060]   to be true but more generally,
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:42.640]   organisms would evolve to see the truth.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.640]   So the best pushback we've gotten is from a team at Yale
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.180]   and they suggested that if you use
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.400]   thousands of payoff functions, so we,
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.740]   in our simulations, we just used a couple, one or two,
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:00.280]   'cause it was our first simulations, right?
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.240]   So that would be a limit.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.380]   We had one or two payoff functions,
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.920]   we showed the result in those,
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.080]   at least for the genetic algorithms.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:10.460]   And they said if you have 20,000 of them,
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.720]   then we can find these conditions in which
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.240]   truth-seeing organisms would be the ones
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.360]   that evolved and survived.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.120]   And so we looked at their simulations
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.160]   and it certainly is the case that you can find
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.560]   special cases in which truth can evolve.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.120]   So when I say it's probability zero,
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.160]   it doesn't mean it can't happen.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.000]   It can happen, in fact, it could happen infinitely often.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.360]   It's just probability zero.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.240]   So probability zero things can happen infinitely often.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.560]   - When you say probability zero,
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.980]   you mean probability close to zero.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.120]   - To be very, very precise.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.780]   So for example, if I have a unit square on the plane,
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:51.440]   and I use a measure in which the,
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.600]   on a probability measure in which the area
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.260]   of a region is this probability.
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:02.400]   Then if I draw a curve in that unit square,
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.460]   it has measure precisely zero.
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:07.920]   Precisely, not approximately, precisely zero.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.120]   And yet it has infinitely many points.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.200]   So there's an object that, for that probability measure,
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.040]   has probability zero, and yet there's
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.280]   infinitely many points in it.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.640]   So that's what I mean when I say that
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.880]   the things that are probability zero
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.800]   can happen infinitely often, in principle.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.080]   - Yeah, but infinity, as far as,
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.120]   and I look outside often, I walk around
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.080]   and I look at people, I have never seen
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.600]   infinity in real life.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.960]   - That's an interesting issue.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.560]   - I've been looking, I've been looking.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:41.200]   I don't notice it, infinitely small or the infinitely big.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.360]   And so the tools of mathematics,
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.680]   you could sort of apply the same kind of criticism
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.200]   that it is a very convenient interface into our reality.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.500]   - That's a big debate in mathematics.
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.260]   The intuitionists versus the ones who take,
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:55.120]   for example, the real numbers as real.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.080]   And that's a fun discussion.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.080]   Nicholas Gieson has, a physicist,
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.920]   has really interesting work recently
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:04.180]   on how if you go with intuitionist mathematics,
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.960]   you could effectively quantize Newton.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.440]   And you find that the Newtonian theory
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.440]   and quantum theory aren't that different
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.440]   once you go with it.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.280]   - It's funny.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.360]   - It's really quite interesting.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.000]   So the issue you raise is a very, very deep one.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.740]   And one that I think we should take quite seriously,
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.640]   which is, how shall we think about the reality
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:32.160]   of the contours hierarchy, A-Left one, A-Left two,
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.840]   and all these different infinities
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.840]   versus just a more algorithmic approach, right?
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:45.240]   So where everything's computable in some sense,
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.200]   everything's finite, as big as you want,
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.760]   but nevertheless finite.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.480]   - So yeah, it ultimately boils down to whether
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:58.480]   the world is discrete or continuous in some general sense.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.200]   And again, we can't really know,
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.480]   but there's just a mind-breaking thought,
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.880]   just common sense reasoning, that something can happen
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.800]   and is yet, probability of it happening is 0%.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.120]   That doesn't compute for common sense computer.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:18.960]   - Right.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.800]   This is where you have to be a sharp mathematician
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.440]   to really, and I'm not.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.980]   - Sharp is one word.
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:27.400]   What I'm saying is common sense computer is,
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.960]   I mean that in a very kind of,
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.160]   in a positive sense, because we've been talking
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.600]   about perception systems and interfaces.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.120]   If we are to reason about the world,
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.040]   we have to use the best interfaces we got.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:50.040]   And I'm not exactly sure that game theory
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.760]   is the best interface we got for this.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.600]   - Oh, right.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.680]   - And application of mathematics,
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.440]   tricks and tools of mathematics,
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.600]   the game theory is the best we got
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.920]   when we are thinking about the nature of reality
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.560]   and fakeness functions and evolution, period.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.040]   - Well, that's a fair rejoinder.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:14.080]   And I think that that was the tool that we used.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.320]   And if someone says, here's a better mathematical tool
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.240]   and here's why, this is, this mathematical tool
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.280]   better captures the essence of Darwin's idea.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.960]   John Maynard Smith didn't quite get it
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.280]   with evolutionary game theory.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.520]   There's this better, this thing.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.640]   Now there are tools like evolutionary graph theory,
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.920]   which generalize evolutionary game theory.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.560]   And then there's quantum game theory.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.560]   So you can use quantum tools like entanglement,
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.460]   for example, as a resource in games
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:48.240]   that change the very nature of the solutions,
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.900]   of the optimal solutions of the game theory.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.440]   - Well, the work from Yale is really interesting.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.320]   It's a really interesting challenge
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.080]   of that kind of, of these ideas where, okay,
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.800]   if you have a very large number of fitness functions,
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:06.360]   or let's say you have a nearly infinite number
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:08.440]   of fitness functions, or a growing number
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.880]   of fitness functions, what kind of interesting things
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:15.560]   start to emerging, if you are to be an organism?
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.880]   If to be an organism that adapts means
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.440]   having to deal with an ensemble of fitness functions.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:26.680]   - Right, and so we've actually redone some
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.040]   of our own work based on theirs.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.320]   And this is the back and forth that we expect in science.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.360]   And what we found was that they, in their simulations,
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.160]   they were assuming that you couldn't carve the world
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.080]   up into objects.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.960]   And so we said, well, let's relax that assumption.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.000]   Allow organisms to create data structures
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.720]   that we might call objects.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.400]   And an object would be, you take,
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.600]   you would do hierarchical clustering
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.200]   of your fitness payoff functions.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.840]   The ones that have similar shapes.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.320]   If you have 20,000 of them, maybe these 50
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.560]   are all very, very similar.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.640]   So I can take all the perception, action, fitness stuff
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.680]   and make that into a data structure,
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.280]   and we'll call that a unit or an object.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.640]   And as soon as we did that,
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.600]   then all of their results went away.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.400]   It turned out they were the special case.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.680]   And that the organisms that were allowed
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.480]   to only see, that were shaped to see only fitness payoffs
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.960]   were the ones that were.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.360]   So the idea is that objects then,
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.160]   what are objects from an evolutionary point of view?
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.160]   This bottle, we thought that when I saw a bottle,
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.760]   it was because I was seeing a true object
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.400]   that existed whether or not it was perceived.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.960]   Evolutionary theories suggest a different interpretation.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.160]   I'm seeing a data structure that is encoding
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:45.440]   a convenient way of looking at various fitness payoffs.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.320]   I can use this for drinking.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.800]   I could use it as a weapon, not a very good one.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.880]   I could beat someone with head with it.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.640]   If my goal is mating, this is pointless.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.680]   So I'm seeing for what I'm coding here
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:04.200]   is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.480]   When I pick up an apple,
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.720]   now I'm getting a different set of actions and payoffs.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.240]   When I pick up a rock, I'm getting.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.240]   So for every object, what I'm getting
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:15.120]   is a different set of payoff functions
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.240]   with various actions.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.720]   And so once you allow that,
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.720]   then what you find is once again that truth goes extinct
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.120]   and the organisms that just get an interface
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.640]   are the ones that win.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.200]   - But the question, just sneaking up on,
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.280]   this is fascinating.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:38.240]   From where do fitness functions originate?
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.240]   What gives birth to the fitness functions?
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:43.360]   So if there's a giant black box
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.160]   that just keeps giving you fitness functions,
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.200]   what are we trying to optimize?
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.080]   You said that water has different uses
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:57.000]   than an apple, so there's these objects.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.880]   What are we trying to optimize?
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.720]   And why is not reality a really good generator
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.840]   of fitness functions?
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.440]   - So each theory makes its own assumptions.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.640]   It says, grant me this, and I'll explain that.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.040]   So evolutionary game theory says,
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.320]   grant me fitness payoffs.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.360]   And grant me strategies with payoffs.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.560]   And I can write down the matrix
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.320]   for if this strategy interacts with that strategy,
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.640]   these are the payoffs that come up.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:22.480]   If you grant me that,
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.560]   then I can start to explain a lot of things.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.920]   Now you can ask for a deeper question,
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.920]   like, okay, how does physics evolve biology
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.900]   and where do these fitness payoffs come from?
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.080]   Now, that's a completely different enterprise.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.160]   And of course, evolutionary game theory then
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.360]   would be not the right tool for that.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.480]   It would have to be a deeper tool
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.320]   that shows where evolutionary game theory comes from.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:55.680]   My own take is that there's gonna be a problem in doing that
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.260]   because space-time isn't fundamental.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:03.360]   It's just a user interface.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.240]   And that the distinction that we make
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.480]   between living and non-living
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.620]   is not a fundamental distinction.
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.220]   It's an artifact of the limits of our interface.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:16.400]   Right, so this is a new wrinkle,
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.040]   and this is an important wrinkle.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:22.260]   It's so nice to take space and time as fundamental
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:24.280]   because if something looks like it's inanimate,
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.160]   it's inanimate, and we can just say it's not living.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.760]   Now, it's much more complicated.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.200]   Certain things are obviously living.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.240]   I'm talking with you.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.560]   I'm obviously interacting with something
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.640]   that's alive and conscious.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.680]   - I think we've let go of the word obviously
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.000]   in this conversation.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.320]   I think nothing is obvious.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.280]   - Nothing's obvious, that's right.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.960]   But when we get down to an ant, it's obviously living,
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.560]   but I'll say it appears to be living.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.600]   When we get down to a virus, now people wonder,
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.240]   and when we get down to protons,
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.840]   people say it's not living.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.620]   And my attitude is, look, I have a user interface.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.780]   The interface is there to hide certain aspects of reality
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:10.780]   and others to, it's an uneven representation,
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:11.960]   put it that way.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.060]   Certain things just get completely hidden.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:18.580]   Dark matter and dark energy are most of the energy
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:19.780]   and matter that's out there.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.140]   Our interface just plain flat out hides them.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:26.140]   The only way we get some hint is because gravitational
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.740]   things are going wrong within our.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.980]   So most things are outside of our interface.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:34.220]   The distinction between living and non-living
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.180]   is not fundamental, it's an artifact of our interface.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.980]   So if, so this is the, if we really,
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:43.620]   really want to understand where evolution comes from,
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.740]   to answer the question, the deep question you asked,
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.660]   I think the right way we're gonna have to do that
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.220]   is to come up with a deeper theory than space-time,
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.340]   in which there may not be the notion of time.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:59.860]   And show that whatever this dynamics of that
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.620]   deeper theory is, and by the way,
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.460]   I'll talk about how you could have dynamics without time,
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:07.140]   but the dynamics of this deeper theory,
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:11.020]   when we project it into, in certain ways,
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:13.060]   then we do get space-time and we get what appears
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:15.060]   to be evolution by natural selection.
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.760]   So I would love to see evolution by natural selection,
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.220]   nature, red and tooth and claw, people fighting,
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.220]   animals fighting for resources and the whole bit,
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.260]   come out of a deeper theory in which perhaps
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.620]   it's all cooperation.
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.940]   There's no limited resources and so forth,
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:32.260]   but as a result of projection, you get space and time,
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.260]   and as a result of projection, you get nature,
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.460]   red and tooth and claw, the appearance of it,
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:39.100]   but it's all an artifact of the interface.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:43.220]   - I like this idea that the line between living
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:45.020]   and non-living is very important,
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:48.660]   'cause that's a thing that would emerge
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:52.420]   before you have evolution, the idea of death.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.860]   So that seems to be an important component
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.060]   of natural selection, and if that emerged,
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:05.500]   because that's also, you know, asking the question,
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:09.060]   I guess, that I ask, where do fitness functions come from?
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:12.940]   That's like asking the old meaning of life question, right?
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:17.500]   It's what's the why, why, why?
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:20.300]   And one of the big underlying why's,
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.660]   okay, you can start with evolution on Earth,
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.100]   but without living, without life and death,
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.700]   without the line between the living and the dead,
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.520]   you don't have evolution.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.540]   So what if underneath it, there's no such thing
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.900]   as the living and the dead?
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:39.500]   There's no, like this concept of an organism, period,
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:42.700]   there's a living organism that's defined
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:47.700]   by a volume in space-time that somehow interacts,
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:52.860]   that over time maintains its integrity somehow,
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:56.580]   it has some kind of history, it has a wall of some kind,
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:58.380]   the outside world, the environment,
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.780]   and then inside, there's an organism.
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.940]   So you're defining an organism,
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.900]   and also, you define that organism
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:09.900]   by the fact that it can move, and it can come alive,
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:12.100]   which you kind of think of as moving,
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.700]   combined with the fact that it's keeping itself
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:15.980]   separate from the environment,
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:17.900]   so you can point out that thing is living,
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.580]   and then it can also die.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:26.060]   That seems to be all very powerful components of space-time
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.380]   that enable you to have something
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:30.840]   like natural selection and evolution.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.140]   - Well, and there's a lot of interesting work,
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:36.200]   some of it by collaborators of Carl Friston and others,
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.940]   where they have Bayes' net kind of stuff
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:43.820]   that they build on, and the notion of a Markov blanket,
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:47.220]   so you have some states within this network
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.140]   that are inside the blanket, then you have the blanket,
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.820]   and then the states outside the blanket,
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:52.980]   and the states inside this Markov blanket
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.300]   are conditionally independent of the states
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:57.420]   outside the blanket, conditioned on the blanket.
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:01.260]   And what they're looking at is that the dynamics
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:04.500]   inside of the states inside the Markov blanket
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.180]   seem to be trying to estimate properties of the outside
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.020]   and react to them in a way,
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.340]   so it seems like you're doing probabilistic inferences
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.260]   in ways that might be able to keep you alive,
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:17.600]   so there's interesting work going on in that direction,
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:21.580]   but what I'm saying is something slightly different,
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:24.860]   and that is, like when I look at you,
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:26.460]   all I see is skin, hair, and eyes, right?
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:27.500]   That's all I see.
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:31.220]   But I know that there's a deeper reality,
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:32.660]   I believe that there's a much deeper reality,
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:34.260]   there's the whole world of your experiences,
[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:35.860]   your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:38.700]   In some sense, the face that I see
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:42.140]   is just a symbol that I create, right?
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.860]   And as soon as I look away, I delete that symbol,
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:46.340]   but I don't delete you,
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.540]   I don't delete the conscious experience,
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.260]   the whole world of your,
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.520]   so I'm only deleting an interface symbol,
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:58.520]   but that interface symbol is a portal, so to speak,
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:04.380]   not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:06.540]   into your beliefs, into your conscious experiences,
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.820]   into, that's why we can have a conversation,
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.740]   we genuinely, what your consciousness
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:12.180]   is genuinely affecting mine,
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.900]   and mine is genuinely affecting yours,
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:17.660]   through these icons, which I create on the fly,
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:20.120]   I mean, I create your face, when I look, I delete it.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.100]   I don't create you, your consciousness,
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.020]   that's there all the time, but I do,
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:27.420]   so now when I look at a cat,
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.940]   I'm creating something that I still call living,
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:31.920]   and I still think is conscious.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.700]   When I look at an ant, I create something
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:38.160]   that I still would call living, but maybe not conscious.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.700]   When I look at something I call a virus,
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.940]   now I'm not even sure I would call it living,
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:45.420]   and when I look at a proton, I would say,
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:48.900]   I don't even think it's not alive at all.
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:53.620]   It could be that I'm nevertheless interacting
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.700]   with something that's just as conscious as you.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.460]   I'm not saying the proton is conscious.
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.420]   The face that I'm creating, when I look at you,
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.580]   that face is not conscious,
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:03.700]   that face is a data structure in me,
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:07.460]   that face is an experience, it's not an experiencer.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:12.700]   Similarly, a proton is something that I create
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:16.140]   when I look or do a collision in the Large Hadron Collider
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:17.300]   or something like that,
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:21.420]   but what is behind the entity in space-time?
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.180]   So I've got this space-time interface,
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.580]   and I've just got this entity that I call a proton.
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:27.500]   What is the reality behind it?
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.780]   Well, the physicists are finding these big, big structures,
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.980]   amplituhedron, the sociahedron,
[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:36.020]   what's behind those?
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:38.740]   Could be consciousness, what I'm playing with,
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:41.220]   in which case, when I'm interacting with a proton,
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:43.740]   I could be interacting with consciousness.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:46.980]   Again, to be very, very clear, 'cause it's easy to,
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.300]   I'm not saying a proton is conscious,
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:51.340]   just like I'm not saying your face is conscious.
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:54.300]   Your face is a symbol I create and then delete
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.380]   as I look, and so your face is not conscious,
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:00.060]   but I know that that face in my interface,
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.860]   the Lex Friedman face that I create,
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:04.260]   is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.060]   into your consciousness.
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:09.980]   The portal is less clear for a cat,
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:11.860]   even less clear for an ant,
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.380]   and by the time we get down to a proton,
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:15.900]   the portal is not clear at all.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.140]   But that doesn't mean I'm not interacting
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:20.180]   with consciousness, it just means my interface gave up,
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:23.020]   and there's some deeper reality that we have to go after.
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:26.980]   So your question really forces out a big part
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:29.100]   of this whole approach that I'm talking about.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:30.580]   - So it's this portal and consciousness.
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:35.140]   I wonder why you can't, your portal is not as good
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:39.260]   to a cat, to a cat's consciousness,
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:40.420]   than it is to a human.
[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:43.740]   Does it have to do with the fact that you're human
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:49.820]   and just similar organisms, organisms of similar complexity
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:53.460]   are able to create portals better to each other,
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.660]   or is it just, as you get more and more complex,
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.900]   you get better and better portals?
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:00.260]   - Well, let me answer one aspect of it
[01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:01.180]   that I'm more confident about,
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:03.540]   and then I'll speculate on that.
[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:07.180]   Why is it that the portal is so bad with protons?
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.500]   Well, and elementary particles more generally,
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:12.260]   so quarks, leptons, and gluons, and so forth.
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:16.140]   Well, the reason for that is because those are just
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:18.280]   symmetries of space-time.
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:21.060]   More technically, they're irreducible representations
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.960]   of the Poincaré group of space-time.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:29.820]   So they're just literally representations
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.580]   of the data structure of space-time that we're using.
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:35.820]   So that's why they're not very much insightful.
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.300]   They're just almost entirely tied
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.740]   to the data structure itself.
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:42.780]   There's not much, they're telling you only something
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:44.940]   about the data structure, not behind the data structure.
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.740]   It's only when we get to higher levels
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:48.500]   that we're starting to, in some sense,
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:52.300]   build portals to what's behind space-time.
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.580]   - Sure, yeah, so there's more and more
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:23:00.300]   complexity built on top of the interface
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.020]   of space-time with the cat.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.420]   - So you can actually build a portal, right?
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:06.440]   - Yeah, yeah, right.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:12.740]   Yeah, this interface of face, and hair, and so on, skin.
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:20.100]   There's some syncing going on between humans, though,
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.980]   where we sync, like, you're getting
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:26.260]   a pretty good representation of the ideas in my head,
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:31.260]   and starting to get a foggy view of my memories in my head.
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:36.300]   Even though this is the first time we're talking,
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.620]   you start to project your own memories.
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.780]   You start to solve a giant hierarchy
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:43.620]   of puzzles about a human.
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.980]   'Cause we're all, there's a lot of similarities,
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.980]   a lot of it rhymes, so you start to make
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.780]   a lot of inferences, and you build up this model
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:52.620]   of a person.
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:54.400]   You have a pretty sophisticated model
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.140]   of what's going on underneath.
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:00.540]   Again, I just, I wonder if it's possible
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.460]   to construct these models about each other,
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:04.900]   and nevertheless be very distant
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.100]   from an underlying reality.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.260]   The syncing. - Yeah, there's a lot
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:10.080]   of work on this.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.040]   So there's some interesting work called signaling games,
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:15.380]   where they look at how people can coordinate
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:19.060]   and come to communicate.
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:21.140]   There's some interesting work that was done
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:23.100]   by some colleagues and friends of mine,
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:28.340]   Louis Nerons, Natalia Komarova, and Kimberly Jamison,
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:33.340]   where they were looking at evolving color words.
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:36.100]   So you have a circle of colors,
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.780]   you know, this is the color circle.
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:41.040]   And they wanted to see if they could get people
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.080]   to cooperate in how they carved the color circle
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.900]   up into units of words.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:49.620]   And so they had a game, a theoretic kind of thing
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:50.620]   that they'd had people do.
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.920]   And what they found was that when they included,
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.940]   so most people are trichromats,
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:57.920]   you have three kinds of cone photoreceptors,
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.460]   but there are some, a lot of men,
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.420]   7% of men are dichromats,
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:04.380]   they might be missing the red cone photoreceptor.
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:08.980]   They found that the dichromats had an outsized influence
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:12.540]   on the final ways that the whole space of colors
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.900]   was carved up and labels attached.
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:17.880]   You needed to be able to include the dichromats
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.120]   in the conversation, and so they had a bigger influence
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.020]   on how you made the boundaries of the language.
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:25.700]   And I thought that was a really interesting kind of insight
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.880]   that there's going to be again, a game,
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.440]   perhaps a game or evolutionary or genetic algorithm
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.400]   kind of thing that goes on in terms of learning
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.900]   to communicate in ways that are useful.
[01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.940]   And so, yeah, you can use game theory
[01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:42.580]   to actually explore that or signaling games.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.740]   There's a lot of brilliant work on that.
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.620]   I'm not doing it, but there's work out there.
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:50.840]   - So if it's okay, let us tackle once more,
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.640]   and perhaps several more times,
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.560]   after the big topic of consciousness.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:59.560]   This very beautiful, powerful things
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.960]   that perhaps is the thing that makes us human.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.080]   What is it?
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.300]   What's the role of consciousness in,
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.160]   let's say even just the thing we've been talking about,
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.280]   which is the formation of this interface.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:15.720]   Any kind of ways you want to kind of start
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.460]   talking about it?
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:21.420]   - Well, let me say first what most of my colleagues say.
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:27.620]   99% are again, assuming that space-time is fundamental,
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:30.000]   particles in space-time, matter is fundamental,
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.540]   and most are reductionist.
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:37.120]   And so the standard approach to consciousness
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:42.120]   is to figure out what complicated systems of matter
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:45.980]   with the right functional properties
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.560]   could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.560]   That's the general idea, right?
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.920]   So maybe you have to have neurons.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.920]   Maybe only if you have neurons,
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.640]   but that might not be enough.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.400]   They have to certain kinds of complexity
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.840]   in their organization and their dynamics,
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.200]   certain kind of network abilities, for example.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:10.760]   So there are those who say, for example,
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.680]   that consciousness arises from orchestrated collapse
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.400]   of quantum states of microtubules and neurons.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.440]   So this is Hameroff and Penrose have this kind of.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.440]   So you start with something physical,
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.540]   a property of quantum states of neurons,
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:32.160]   of microtubules and neurons,
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.680]   and you say that somehow an orchestrated collapse of those
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.720]   is consciousness or conscious experiences.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.480]   Or integrated information theory.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.560]   Again, you start with something physical,
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.880]   and if it has the right kind of functional properties,
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.260]   it's something they call phi,
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.040]   with the right kind of integrated information,
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.600]   then you have consciousness.
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:54.900]   Or you can be a panpsychist, Philip Goff, for example,
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:57.300]   where you might say, well,
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:01.320]   in addition to the particles in space and time,
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.400]   those particles are not just matter,
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.520]   they also could have, say, a unit of consciousness.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.320]   And so, but once again, you're taking space and time
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.200]   and particles as fundamental,
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:14.080]   and you're adding a new property to them,
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.080]   say, their consciousness,
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.720]   and then you have to talk about how,
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.560]   when a proton and a neutron,
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.840]   where a proton and electron get together to form hydrogen,
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.160]   then how those consciousnesses merge to,
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.400]   or interact to create the consciousness of hydrogen,
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.240]   and so forth.
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.520]   There's attention schema theory,
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.720]   which again, this is how neural network processes,
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:38.320]   representing to the network itself,
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.000]   its attentional processes,
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.780]   that could be consciousness.
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:44.400]   There's global workspace theory,
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.400]   and neuronal global workspace theory.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.440]   So there's many, many theories of this type.
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.800]   What's common to all of them
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.260]   is they assume that space-time is fundamental.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:57.920]   They assume that physical processes
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.640]   in space-time is fundamental.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:02.560]   Panpsychism adds consciousness as an additional thing,
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.620]   it's almost dualist in that regard.
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:08.620]   And my attitude is,
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:11.240]   our best science is telling us
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:13.320]   that space-time is not fundamental.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:17.120]   So, why is that important here?
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.700]   Well, for centuries,
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:24.460]   deep thinkers thought of earth, air, fire, and water
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:26.280]   as the fundamental elements.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.620]   It was a reductionist kind of idea.
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:30.120]   Nothing was more elemental than those,
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:33.520]   and you could sort of build everything up from those.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.220]   When we got the periodic table of elements,
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:40.020]   we realized that, of course,
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:42.040]   we want to study earth, air, fire, and water.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.200]   There's combustion science for fire.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:49.020]   There's sciences for all these other things,
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:50.300]   water and so forth.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:51.900]   So we're gonna do science with these things,
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:54.220]   but fundamental, no, no.
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:56.220]   If you're looking for something fundamental,
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:58.500]   those are the wrong building blocks.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:02.160]   Earth has many, many different kinds of elements
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.660]   that project into the one thing that we call earth.
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.800]   If you don't understand that there's silicon,
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.640]   that there's iron,
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.020]   that there's all these different kinds of things
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:10.820]   that project into what we call earth,
[01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:14.660]   you're hopelessly lost.
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:15.780]   You're not fundamental.
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.020]   You're not gonna get there.
[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:19.820]   And then, after the periodic table,
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:22.260]   then we came up with quarks, leptons, and gluons,
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:26.480]   the particles of the standard model of physics.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.020]   And so, we actually now know
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:31.180]   that if you really want to get fundamental,
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:34.620]   the periodic table is a net.
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.620]   It's good for chemistry.
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:37.180]   And it's wonderful for chemistry.
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:39.820]   But if you're trying to go deep, fundamental,
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:41.460]   what is the fundamental science?
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:42.300]   That's not it.
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:44.540]   You're gonna have to go to quarks, leptons,
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:46.060]   and gluons, and so forth.
[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:51.060]   Well, now, we've discovered space-time itself is doomed.
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:52.980]   Quarks, leptons, and gluons
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.940]   are just irreducible representations
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.540]   of the symmetries of space-time.
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:00.300]   So, the whole framework
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:03.860]   on which consciousness research is being based right now
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:05.460]   is doomed.
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:09.180]   And for me, these are my friends and colleagues
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.020]   that are doing this.
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:10.980]   They're brilliant.
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:12.700]   They're brilliant.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:17.740]   My feeling is I'm so sad
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:21.740]   that they're stuck with this old framework
[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:24.260]   because if they weren't stuck
[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:25.860]   with earth, air, fire, and water,
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:27.140]   you could actually make progress.
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:28.700]   So, it doesn't matter how smart you are.
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:30.260]   If you start with earth, air, fire, and water,
[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:31.980]   you're not gonna get anywhere, right?
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:33.820]   - Can I actually just,
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:36.020]   'cause the word doomed is so interesting.
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:39.220]   Let me give you some options, multiple choice quiz.
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:43.180]   Is space-time, we could say, is reality,
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:46.460]   the way we perceive it, doomed,
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:54.140]   wrong, or fake?
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:59.140]   Because doomed just means it could still be right,
[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:01.860]   and we're now ready to go deeper.
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:03.860]   It would be that.
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.500]   - So, it's not wrong.
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:08.340]   It's not a complete deviation
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:10.620]   from a journey toward the truth.
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:13.860]   - Right, it's like earth, air, fire, and water is not wrong.
[01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:15.700]   There is earth, air, fire, and water.
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:19.060]   That's a useful framework, but it's not fundamental.
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:20.820]   - Right, well, there's also wrong,
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:24.460]   which is they used to believe, as I recently learned,
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:28.020]   that George Washington, the first president
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:29.980]   of the United States, was bled to death
[01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:34.020]   for something that could have been easily treated
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.380]   because it was believed that you can get,
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:38.100]   actually, I need to look into this further,
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.820]   but I guess you get toxins out or demons out.
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:41.860]   I don't know what you're getting out
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:43.540]   with the bleeding of a person.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:47.140]   But so that ended up being wrong,
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:50.740]   but widely believed as a medical tool.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:54.620]   So, is it also possible that our assumption
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:58.940]   of space-time is not just doomed, but is wrong?
[01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:02.180]   - Well, if we believe that it's fundamental, that's wrong.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:05.340]   But if we believe it's a useful tool, that's right.
[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:08.100]   - But it could, see, but bleeding somebody to death
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:10.100]   was believed to be a useful tool.
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:11.140]   - And that was wrong.
[01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:13.820]   - It wasn't just not fundamental.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:17.260]   It was very, I'm sure there's cases
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.020]   in which bleeding somebody would work,
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:23.540]   but it would be a very tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of cases.
[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:25.820]   So it could be that it's wrong.
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:29.140]   Like it's a side road that's ultimately leading
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:32.620]   to a dead end as opposed to a truck stop or something
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:34.700]   that you can get off of.
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.340]   - My feeling is not the dead end kind of thing.
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.460]   I think that what the physicists are finding
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:41.700]   is that there are these structures beyond space-time,
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:44.260]   but they project back into space-time.
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:48.240]   And so space-time, when they say space-time is doomed,
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.120]   they're explicit.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.420]   They're saying it's doomed in the sense
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:51.780]   that we thought it was fundamental.
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:53.220]   It's not fundamental.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:55.500]   It's a useful, absolutely useful
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:57.460]   and brilliant data structure.
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:59.500]   But there are deeper data structures
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.460]   like cosmological polytope.
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.980]   And space-time is not fundamental.
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:08.980]   What is doomed in the sense that it's wrong is reductionism.
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:13.980]   - Which is saying space-time is fundamental, essentially.
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.940]   - Right, right.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:19.940]   The idea that somehow being smaller in space and time
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:23.660]   or space-time is a fundamental nature of reality,
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:26.160]   that's just wrong.
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.180]   It turned out to be a useful heuristic
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.900]   for thermodynamics and so forth.
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:31.300]   And in several other places,
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.200]   reductionism has been very useful.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.340]   But that's, in some sense,
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:38.100]   an artifact of how we use our interface.
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:41.620]   - Yeah, so you're saying size doesn't matter.
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:43.500]   Okay, this is very important for me to write down.
[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.180]   - Ultimately. - Ultimately.
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.020]   - Ultimately, right.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:49.740]   I mean, it's useful for theories like thermodynamics
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.460]   and also for understanding brain networks
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:53.940]   in terms of individual neurons
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:58.500]   and neurons in terms of chemical systems inside cells.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:00.340]   That's all very, very useful.
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.380]   But the idea that we're getting
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:05.900]   to the more fundamental nature of reality, no.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:08.260]   When you get all the way down in that direction,
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:09.980]   you get down to the quarks and gluons,
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:11.860]   what you realize is what you've gotten down to
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:13.300]   is not fundamental reality,
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:16.420]   just the irreducible representations of a data structure.
[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:17.780]   That's all you've gotten down to.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:21.660]   So you're always stuck inside the data structure.
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:23.460]   So you seem to be getting closer and closer.
[01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:25.660]   I mean, I went from neural networks to neurons,
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:27.660]   neurons to chemistry, chemistry to particles,
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:29.980]   particles to quarks and gluons.
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:31.500]   I'm getting closer and closer to the real.
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:32.840]   No, I'm getting closer and closer
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.820]   to the actual structure of the data structure
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:38.220]   of space and time, the irreducible representations.
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:39.680]   That's what you're getting closer to,
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.180]   not to a deeper understanding of what's beyond space-time.
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:45.020]   - We'll also refer,
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:48.060]   we'll return again to this question of dynamics
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:51.840]   because you keep saying that space-time is doom,
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:54.420]   but mostly focusing on the space part of that.
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:59.020]   It's very interesting to see why time gets the bad cred too
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:01.060]   because how do you have dynamics without time
[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:02.920]   is the thing I'd love to talk to you a little bit about.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.180]   But let us return.
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:09.380]   Your brilliant whirlwind overview
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:11.420]   of the different theories of consciousness
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:12.460]   that are out there.
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:18.780]   What is consciousness if outside of space-time?
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:20.860]   - If we think that we want to have a model of consciousness,
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:23.940]   we as scientists then have to say,
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:25.140]   what do we want to write down?
[01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:26.940]   What kind of mathematical modeling
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.700]   are we gonna write down, right?
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:29.540]   And if you think about it,
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:31.100]   there's lots of things that you might want to write down
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:32.100]   about consciousness.
[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:34.100]   It's a fairly complicated subject.
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:36.900]   So most of my colleagues are saying,
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:38.380]   let's start with matter or neurons
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:40.940]   and see what properties of matter
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.500]   could create consciousness.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:45.220]   But I'm saying that that whole thing is out.
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:47.740]   Space-time is doomed, that whole thing is out.
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:51.420]   We need to look at consciousness qua consciousness.
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.640]   In other words, not as something
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.500]   that arises in space and time,
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:56.180]   but perhaps as something that creates space and time
[01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:57.180]   as a data structure.
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:36:59.460]   So what do we want?
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:02.020]   And here again, there's no hard and fast rule,
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.820]   but what you as a scientist have to do
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:08.820]   is to pick what you think are the minimal assumptions
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:13.740]   that are gonna allow you to boot up a comprehensive theory.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.120]   That is the trick.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.340]   So what do I want?
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:20.780]   So what I chose to do was to have three things.
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:25.260]   I said that there are conscious experiences,
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:28.940]   feeling of headache, the smell of garlic,
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.220]   experiencing the color red.
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:33.620]   There are, those are conscious.
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:34.860]   So that's a primitive of a theory.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:36.820]   And the reason I want few primitives, why?
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.780]   Because those are the miracles of the theory, right?
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:40.700]   The primitives, the assumptions of the theory
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:42.380]   are the things you're not going to explain.
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.980]   Those are the things you assume.
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:46.300]   - And those experiences you particularly mean
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:49.620]   there's a subjectiveness to them.
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:50.460]   - That's right.
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:51.660]   - It's the thing when people refer
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:54.020]   to the hard problem of consciousness
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:58.140]   is it feels like something to look at the color red, okay.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:58.980]   - Exactly right.
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:00.380]   It feels like something to have a headache
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:02.780]   or to feel upset to your stomach.
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:04.540]   It feels like something.
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:09.540]   And so I'm going to grant that in this theory
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.460]   there are experiences and they're fundamental in some sense.
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:13.820]   So conscious experience.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:15.700]   So they're not derived from physics.
[01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:18.780]   They're not functional properties of particles.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:20.180]   They are sui generis.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.780]   They exist.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:23.740]   Just like we assume space-time exists.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:26.300]   I'm now saying space-time is just a data structure.
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.500]   It doesn't exist independent of conscious experiences.
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:30.740]   - Sorry to interrupt once again,
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:34.460]   but should we be focusing in your thinking on humans alone?
[01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:40.460]   Or is there something about in relation
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:42.180]   to other kinds of organisms
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:44.620]   that have a sufficiently high level of complexity?
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:49.620]   Or even, or is there some kind of generalization
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:52.060]   of the panpsychist idea
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:55.700]   that consciousness permeates all matter
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:58.700]   outside of the usual definition
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:01.180]   of what matter is inside space-time?
[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:04.260]   - So it's beyond human consciousness.
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:06.340]   Human consciousness from my point of view
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:10.500]   would be one of a countless variety of consciousnesses.
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:12.380]   And even within human consciousness,
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:15.780]   there's countless variety of consciousnesses within us.
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:18.420]   You have your left and right hemisphere.
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:20.700]   And apparently if you split the corpus callosum,
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.780]   the personality of the left hemisphere
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:24.340]   and the religious beliefs of the left hemisphere
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:26.380]   can be very different from the right hemisphere.
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:30.660]   And their conscious experiences can be disjoint.
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:32.500]   One could have one conscious experience.
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:33.860]   They can play 20 questions.
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:35.820]   The left hemisphere can have an idea in its mind
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:37.340]   and the right hemisphere has to guess.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.860]   And it might not get it.
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:40.660]   So even within you,
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:43.020]   there is more than just one consciousness.
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.220]   It's lots of consciousnesses.
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:48.660]   So the general theory of consciousness that I'm after
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:50.340]   is not just human consciousness.
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:51.900]   It's going to be just consciousness.
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:56.700]   And I presume human consciousness is a tiny drop
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:59.300]   in the bucket of the infinite variety of consciousnesses.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.100]   - That said, I should clarify
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:03.780]   that the black hole of consciousness
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:07.380]   is the home cat.
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:09.180]   I'm pretty sure cats lack,
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:11.780]   is the embodiment of evil
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:15.980]   and lack all capacity for consciousness or compassion.
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:16.820]   So I just want to lay that on the table.
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:18.180]   That's a theory I'm working on.
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:19.500]   I don't have any good evidence.
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:20.340]   - The black cat.
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:21.900]   - Intuit, that's just a shout out.
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:24.300]   Sorry to distract.
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:25.660]   So that's the first assumption.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:27.180]   - The first assumption.
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:29.160]   The second assumption is that
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.660]   these experiences have consequences.
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:35.020]   So I'm going to say that conscious experiences
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.420]   can trigger other conscious experiences somehow.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:40.740]   So really in some sense,
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.740]   there's two basic assumptions.
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:46.180]   - There's some kind of causality.
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:47.780]   Is there a chain of causality?
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:50.300]   Does this relate to dynamics?
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.700]   - I'll say there's a probabilistic relationship.
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:58.860]   So I'm trying to be as nonspecific to begin with
[01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:01.060]   and see where it leads me.
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:03.980]   So what I can write down are probability spaces.
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:05.100]   So probability space,
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.180]   which contains the conscious experiences
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:09.540]   that this consciousness can have.
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:13.580]   So I call this a conscious agent.
[01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:15.620]   This technical thing,
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:19.260]   now Anika Harris and I have talked about this
[01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:22.860]   and she rightly cautions me that people will think
[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:25.100]   that I'm bringing in a notion of a cell for agency
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.460]   and so forth when I say conscious agent.
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:30.020]   So I just want to say that I use the term conscious agent
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:32.300]   merely as a technical term.
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:34.220]   There is no notion of self
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:36.640]   in my fundamental definition of a conscious agent.
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:41.060]   There are only experiences and probabilistic relationships
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:43.020]   of how they trigger other experiences.
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:46.300]   - So the agent is the generator of the conscious experience?
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:49.580]   - The agent is a mathematical structure
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:51.940]   that includes a probability measure,
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:56.100]   a probability space of a possible conscious experiences
[01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:58.220]   and a Markovian kernel,
[01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:01.080]   which describes how if this agent
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.780]   has certain conscious experiences,
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:04.300]   how that will affect the experiences
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:07.500]   of other conscious agents, including itself.
[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.900]   - But you don't think of that as a self?
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:13.700]   - No, there is no notion of a self here.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:16.600]   There's no notion of really of an agent.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:19.120]   - But is there a locality?
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:22.900]   Is there an organism? - There's no space.
[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:27.900]   So these are conscious units, conscious entities.
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:30.460]   - But they're distinct in some way
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:32.260]   'cause they have to interact.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:33.620]   - Well, so here's the interesting thing.
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:36.100]   When we write down the mathematics,
[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:39.060]   when you have two of these conscious agents interacting,
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:43.700]   the pair satisfy a definition of a conscious agent.
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:46.140]   So they are a single conscious agent.
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:47.860]   So there is one conscious agent.
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:48.700]   - Yeah.
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:52.360]   - But it has a nice analytic decomposition
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.860]   into as many conscious agents as you wish.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:55.500]   - So that's a nice interface.
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:58.700]   - It's a very useful scientific interface.
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:02.500]   It's a scale-free, or if you like a fractal-like,
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:06.320]   approach to it in which we can use the same unit of analysis
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.740]   at all scales in studying consciousness.
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:12.220]   But if I want to talk about,
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:17.140]   so there's no notion of learning, memory, problem-solving,
[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:20.800]   intelligence, self, agency.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.380]   So none of that is fundamental.
[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:26.360]   So, and the reason I did that was
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:29.860]   because I want to assume as little as possible.
[01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:32.180]   Everything I assume is a miracle in the theory.
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:34.500]   It's not something you explain, it's something you assume.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:37.420]   So I have to build networks of conscious agents.
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:41.540]   If I want to have a notion of a self, I have to build a self.
[01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:43.920]   I have to build learning, memory, problem-solving,
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:46.720]   intelligence, and planning, all these different things.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:49.500]   I have to build networks of conscious agents to do that.
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.380]   It's a trivial theorem that networks of conscious agents
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:54.660]   are computationally universal, that's trivial.
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:56.780]   So anything that we can do with neural networks
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.180]   or, you know, automata, you can do
[01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:01.580]   with networks of conscious agents, that's trivial.
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:04.940]   But you can also do more.
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:08.820]   The events in the probability space need not be computable.
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:12.420]   So the Markovian dynamics is not restricted
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:16.380]   to computable functions, because the very events themselves
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:17.860]   need not be computable.
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:21.180]   So this can capture any computable theory.
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:22.580]   Anything we can do with neural networks,
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:25.300]   we can do with conscious agent networks.
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:28.120]   But it leaves open the door for the possibility
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:32.520]   of non-computable interactions between conscious agents.
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:35.600]   So we have to, if we want a theory of memory,
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:38.080]   we have to build it.
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:39.580]   And there's lots of different ways you could build.
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:41.820]   We've actually got a paper, Chris Fields took the lead
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:45.180]   on this, and we have a paper called Conscious Agent Networks
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:47.700]   where Chris takes the lead and shows how to use
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:49.620]   these networks of conscious agents to build memory
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:52.780]   and to build primitive kinds of learning.
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:56.700]   - But can you provide some intuition
[01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:59.980]   of what conscious networks, network of conscious,
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:04.080]   networks of conscious agents helps you,
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:05.880]   first of all, what that looks like?
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:08.940]   And I don't just mean mathematically.
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:11.580]   Of course, maybe that might help build up intuition,
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.020]   but how that helps us potentially solve
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:16.460]   the hard problem of consciousness.
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:17.660]   - Right.
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:21.620]   - Or is that baked in, that that exists?
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:27.100]   Can you solve the hard problem of consciousness,
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:30.340]   why it tastes delicious when you eat a delicious ice cream
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:33.860]   with networks of conscious agents?
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:36.020]   Or is that taken as an assumption?
[01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:40.060]   - So the standard way the hard problem is thought of
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:44.580]   is we're assuming space and time in particles,
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:45.980]   or neurons, for example.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:50.020]   These are just physical things that have no consciousness.
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:51.760]   And we have to explain how the conscious experience
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:54.940]   of the taste of chocolate could emerge from those.
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:57.100]   So that's the typical hard problem of consciousness
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:58.740]   is that problem, right?
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:02.060]   How do you boot up the taste of chocolate,
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:06.260]   the experience of the taste of chocolate from neurons, say,
[01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:10.560]   or the right kind of artificial intelligence circuitry?
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:11.660]   How do you boot that up?
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.300]   That's typically what the hard problem of consciousness
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.820]   means to researchers.
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:18.340]   Notice that I'm changing the problem.
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:21.380]   I'm not trying to boot up conscious experiences
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:23.780]   from the dynamics of neurons or silicon
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:25.020]   or something like that.
[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:27.840]   I'm saying that that's the wrong problem.
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.900]   My hard problem would go in the other direction.
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:33.500]   If I start with conscious experiences,
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:35.620]   how do I build up space and time?
[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:37.540]   How do I build up what I call the physical world?
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:39.580]   How do I build up what we call brains?
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:43.060]   Because I'm saying consciousness
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:45.620]   is not something that brains do.
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:48.020]   Brains are something that consciousness makes up.
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:50.820]   It's among the experience,
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:54.540]   it's an ephemeral experience in consciousness.
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:57.020]   I look inside, so to be very, very clear,
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:58.740]   right now I have no neurons.
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:03.200]   If you looked, you would see neurons.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:05.300]   That's a data structure that you would create on the fly,
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:06.440]   and it's a very useful one.
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.540]   As soon as you look away,
[01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:10.020]   you garbage collect that data structure,
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:11.820]   just like that Necker cube that I was talking about
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:12.960]   on the piece of paper.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:15.160]   When you look, you see a 3D cube.
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.360]   You create it on the fly.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:19.600]   As soon as you look away, that's gone.
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.920]   - When you say you, you mean a human being scientist?
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.600]   - Right now, that's right.
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.960]   More generally, it'll be conscious agents,
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.360]   because as you pointed out,
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:31.720]   am I asking for a theory of consciousness only about humans?
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:33.920]   No, it's consciousness,
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:38.200]   which human consciousness is just a tiny sliver.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.160]   - But you are saying that there is,
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.880]   that's a useful data structure.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:43.800]   How many other data structures are there?
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.480]   That's why I said you, human.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.520]   If there's another Earth,
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.680]   if there's another alien civilization
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.680]   and doing these kinds of investigations,
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.320]   would they come up with similar data structures?
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.160]   - Probably not.
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:56.560]   - What is the space of data structures,
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.000]   I guess is what I'm asking.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:04.040]   - My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental,
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.540]   consciousness is all there is,
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:11.000]   then the only thing that mathematical structure can be about
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.100]   is possibilities of consciousness.
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:17.900]   And that suggests to me
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:21.260]   that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses.
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:25.140]   And a vanishingly small fraction of them
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:27.820]   use space-time data structures,
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:29.540]   and the kinds of structures that we use.
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:32.020]   There's an infinite variety of data structures.
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:33.620]   Now, this is very similar to something
[01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:36.060]   that Max Tegmark has said, but I want to distinguish it.
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:40.460]   He has this level four multiverse idea.
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:43.060]   He thinks that mathematics is fundamental.
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:45.020]   And so that's the fundamental reality.
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:47.380]   And since there's an infinite variety of,
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:49.020]   endless variety of mathematical structures,
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:52.580]   there's an infinite variety of multiverses, in his view.
[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:55.320]   I'm saying something similar in spirit,
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:56.980]   but importantly different.
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:59.060]   There's an infinite variety of mathematical structures,
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:48:59.880]   absolutely.
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.180]   But mathematics isn't the fundamental reality
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:04.980]   in this framework.
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:06.660]   Consciousness is.
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:09.360]   And mathematics is to consciousness,
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:11.980]   like bones are to an organism.
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:12.860]   You need the bones.
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:16.480]   So mathematics is not divorced from consciousness,
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:20.340]   but it's not the entirety of consciousness by any means.
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:24.420]   And so there's an infinite variety of consciousnesses
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:27.260]   and signaling games that consciousnesses
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:30.140]   could interact via.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:34.340]   And therefore worlds, common worlds, data structures,
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:37.200]   that they can use to communicate.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:40.220]   So space and time is just one of an infinite variety.
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:43.580]   And so I think that what we'll find is that
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:46.240]   as we go outside of our little space time bubble,
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:51.700]   we will encounter utterly alien forms
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:56.460]   of conscious experience that we may not be able to
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:50:00.300]   really comprehend in the following sense.
[01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:03.400]   If I ask you to imagine a color
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.900]   that you've never seen before,
[01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:07.040]   does anything happen?
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.780]   (Luke laughs)
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:09.620]   Nothing happens.
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:10.820]   - No.
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:11.660]   - Nothing happens.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:13.260]   And that's just one color.
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:14.940]   I'm asking for just a color.
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.620]   We actually know, by the way,
[01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:20.660]   that apparently there are women called tetraphams
[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:25.900]   who have four color receptors, not just three.
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:29.140]   And Kimberly Jamison and others who've studied these women
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:31.380]   have good evidence that they apparently have
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.260]   a new dimension of color experience
[01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:36.180]   that the rest of us don't have.
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:40.540]   So these women are apparently living in a world of color
[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:42.580]   that you and I can't even concretely imagine.
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:44.100]   No man can imagine them.
[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:44.940]   - Yeah.
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:47.140]   - And yet they're real color experiences.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:49.140]   And so in that sense, I'm saying,
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:51.260]   now take that little baby step,
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:53.280]   oh, there are women who have color experiences
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.120]   that I could never have.
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:55.300]   Well, that's shocking.
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:57.820]   Now take that infinite.
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:00.580]   There are consciousnesses where every aspect
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:03.380]   of their experiences is like that new color.
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:05.740]   It's something utterly alien to you.
[01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:07.820]   You have nothing like that.
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:10.020]   And yet these are all possible varieties
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:11.300]   of conscious experience.
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:13.340]   - When you say there's a lot of consciousnesses,
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:16.380]   as a singular consciousness,
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:19.900]   basically the set of possible experiences you can have
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:21.220]   in that subjective way,
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:25.040]   as opposed to the underlying mechanism.
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:30.860]   'Cause you say that having extra color receptor,
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:34.100]   ability to have new experiences
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:36.660]   is somehow a different consciousness.
[01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:39.660]   Is there a way to see that as all the same consciousness,
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.500]   the subjectivity itself?
[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:45.180]   - Right, because when we have two of these conscious agents
[01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:46.720]   interacting in the mathematics,
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.540]   they actually satisfy the definition of a conscious agent.
[01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:52.220]   So in fact, they are a single conscious agent.
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:55.500]   So in fact, one way to think about what I'm saying,
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.340]   I'm postulating with my colleagues,
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:00.300]   Chetan and Chris and others, Robert Prentner and so forth.
[01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:05.300]   There is one big conscious agent, infinitely complicated.
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:08.320]   But fortunately, we can, for analytic purposes,
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.740]   break it down all the way to, in some sense,
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:11.740]   the simplest conscious agent,
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:13.960]   which has one conscious experience, one.
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:18.340]   This one agent can experience red 35, that's it.
[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:20.260]   That's what it experiences.
[01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:22.860]   You can get all the way down to that.
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:26.860]   - So you think it's possible that consciousness,
[01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:29.200]   whatever that is,
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:34.020]   is much more, is fundamental,
[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:37.500]   or at least much more in the direction of the fundamental
[01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:40.500]   than is space-time as we perceive it?
[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:41.660]   - That's the proposal.
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:45.020]   And therefore, what I have to do,
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:47.540]   in terms of the hard problem of consciousness,
[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:51.660]   is to show how dynamical systems of conscious agents
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:55.180]   could lead to what we call space and time and neurons
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:56.700]   and brain activity.
[01:52:56.700 --> 01:53:00.380]   In other words, we have to show how you get space-time
[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:02.420]   and physical objects
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:06.260]   entirely from a theory of conscious agents
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.760]   outside of space-time, with the dynamics
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:09.940]   outside of space-time.
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:13.940]   And I can tell you how we plan to do that,
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:15.780]   but that's the idea.
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:18.940]   - Okay, the magic of it, the chocolate is delicious.
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:22.740]   So there's a mathematical kind of thing
[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:24.460]   that we could say here, how it can emerge
[01:53:24.460 --> 01:53:27.780]   within this system of networks of conscious agents,
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:32.780]   but is there going to be at the end of the proof
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:35.980]   why chocolate is so delicious?
[01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:38.300]   Or no?
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:41.980]   I guess I'm going to ask different kinds of dumb questions
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:43.220]   to try to sneak up.
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:44.780]   - Oh, well, that's the right question.
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:47.020]   And when I say that I took conscious experiences
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:49.540]   as fundamental, what that means is,
[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:51.580]   in the current version of my theory,
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:54.140]   I'm not explaining conscious experiences
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:55.700]   where they came from.
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:58.160]   That's the miracle, that's one of the miracles.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:53:59.620]   So I have two miracles in my theory.
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:02.300]   There are conscious experiences, like the taste of chocolate
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:06.180]   and that there's a probabilistic relationship.
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:08.660]   When certain conscious experiences occur,
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:10.580]   others are more likely to occur.
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:12.460]   Those are the two miracles that--
[01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:17.460]   - It's possible to get beyond that
[01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:19.560]   and somehow start to chip away
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:22.380]   at the miracle-ness of that miracle,
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:24.660]   that chocolate is delicious.
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:25.500]   - I hope so.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.620]   I've got my hands full with what I'm doing right now,
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:32.220]   but I can just say at top level how I would think about that.
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:35.220]   That would get at this consciousness without form.
[01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:46.140]   This is really tough, because it's consciousness
[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:48.040]   without form versus the various forms
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:52.080]   that consciousness takes for the experiences that it has.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:55.080]   - Right, right.
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:00.080]   - So when I write down a probability space
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:02.960]   for these conscious experiences,
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:04.280]   I say, here's a probability space
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.180]   for the possible conscious experiences.
[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:08.760]   It's just like when I write down a probability space
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:12.480]   for an experiment, like I'm gonna flip a coin twice,
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:15.200]   and I want to look at the probabilities of various outcomes.
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:16.360]   So I have to write down a probability space.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:18.600]   There could be heads, heads, heads, tails,
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:20.400]   tails, heads, tails, tails.
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.400]   So you, before, as any class in probability,
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.360]   you're told, write down your probability space.
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:26.720]   If you don't write down your probability space,
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:28.160]   you can't get started.
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:30.640]   So here's my probability space for consciousness.
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:33.240]   How do I want to interpret that structure?
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:34.580]   The structure's just sitting there.
[01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:37.520]   There's gonna be a dynamics that happens on it, right?
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.600]   Experiences appear and then they disappear,
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.000]   just like heads appears and disappears.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000]   So one way to think about that fundamental probability space
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.260]   is that corresponds to consciousness without any content.
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:54.400]   The infinite consciousness
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.840]   that transcends any particular content.
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:02.440]   - Well, do you think of that as a mechanism, as a thing,
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:06.960]   like the rules that govern the dynamics of the thing
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.540]   outside of space-time?
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:10.680]   Isn't that, if you think consciousness is fundamental,
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:12.760]   isn't it essentially getting like,
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:14.920]   it is solving the hard problem,
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:19.920]   which is like, from where does this thing pop up,
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.320]   which is the mechanism of the thing popping up.
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:27.360]   Whatever the consciousness is, the different kinds,
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:29.680]   so on, that mechanism.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:32.440]   And also, the question I want to ask is,
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:37.440]   how tricky do you think it is to solve that problem?
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:40.280]   You've solved a lot of difficult problems
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:42.080]   throughout the history of humanity.
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:47.600]   There's probably more problems to solve left
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:51.520]   than we've solved by like an infinity.
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:57.160]   But along that long journey of intelligent species,
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:01.080]   when will we solve this consciousness one?
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.040]   Just one way to measure the difficulty of the problem.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.600]   - So I'll give two answers.
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:07.640]   There's one problem I think we can solve,
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:09.920]   but we haven't solved yet.
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:12.840]   And that is the reverse of what my colleagues
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:13.940]   call the hard problem.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:17.160]   The problem of how do you start with conscious experiences
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:18.560]   in the way that I've just described them,
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.840]   and the dynamics, and build up space and time and brains,
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.120]   that I think is a tough technical problem,
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:26.240]   but it's in principle solvable.
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.760]   So I think we can solve that.
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:29.400]   So we would solve the hard problem,
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.280]   not by showing how brains create consciousness,
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:33.080]   but how networks of conscious agents
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:36.000]   create what we call the symbols that we call brains.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:41.400]   So that I think, but does that allow you to,
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:43.480]   so that's interesting, that's an interesting idea.
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:44.720]   Consciousness creates the brain,
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:46.440]   not the brain creates consciousness.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:49.440]   But does that allow you to build the thing?
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:53.480]   My guess is that it will enable unbelievable technologies.
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.880]   And I'll tell you why.
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:57.760]   I think it plugs into the work
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:58.880]   that the physicists are doing.
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:01.920]   So this theory of consciousness will be even deeper
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.960]   than the structures that the physicists are finding,
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.120]   like the amplituhedron.
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:08.100]   But the other answer to your question
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:09.280]   is less positive.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:13.080]   As I said earlier, I think that there is no such thing
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.380]   as a theory of everything.
[01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:19.200]   So that I think that my,
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:21.720]   the theory that my team is working on,
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:25.440]   this conscious agent theory, is just a 1.0 theory.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:29.920]   We're using probability of spaces and Markovian kernels.
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.720]   I can easily see people now saying,
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:35.000]   "Well, we can do better if we go to category theory,
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.900]   "and we can get a deeper, perhaps more interesting."
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:39.740]   And then someone will say,
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:41.580]   "Well, now I'll go to topoi theory."
[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:42.460]   And then there'll be,
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:45.620]   so I imagine that there'll be conscious agents,
[01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:49.260]   five, 10, 3 trillion, 0.0.
[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:51.800]   But I think it will never end.
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:54.400]   I think ultimately, this question
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:55.940]   that we sort of put our fingers on,
[01:58:55.940 --> 01:59:00.940]   of how does the formless give birth to form?
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:05.820]   To the taste, the wonderful taste of chocolate.
[01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:10.240]   I think that we will always go deeper and deeper,
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:11.700]   but we will never solve that.
[01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:15.160]   That in some sense, that will be a primitive.
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:16.780]   I hope I'm wrong.
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:21.260]   Maybe it's just the limits of my current imagination.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:26.040]   So I'll just say my imagination right now
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:29.280]   doesn't peer that deep.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:31.680]   Hopefully, so I don't, by the way, I'm saying this,
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:35.100]   I don't want to discourage some brilliant 20-year-old
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:37.940]   who then later on proves me dead wrong.
[01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:39.340]   I hope to be proven dead wrong.
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:41.060]   - Just like you said, essentially from now,
[01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:43.340]   everything we're saying now, everything you're saying,
[01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:45.580]   all of your theories will be laughing stock.
[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:50.580]   They will respect the puzzle-solving abilities
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:54.060]   and how much we were able to do with so little,
[01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:57.420]   but outside of that, it will all be just,
[01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:01.760]   the silliness will be entertainment for a teenager.
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:03.120]   - Especially the silliness when we thought
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:05.120]   that we were so smart and we knew it all.
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:08.320]   - So it would be interesting to explore your ideas
[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:12.560]   by contrasting, you mentioned Annika, Annika Harris,
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:14.560]   you mentioned Philip Goff.
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:18.320]   So outside of, if you're not allowed to say
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:21.640]   the fundamental disagreement is the fact
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:23.320]   that space-time is fundamental,
[02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:26.640]   what are interesting distinctions
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:28.480]   between ideas of consciousness
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.080]   between you and Annika, for example?
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:33.400]   You guys have, you've been on a podcast together,
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:36.280]   I'm sure in private,
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:38.120]   you guys have some incredible conversations.
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:41.600]   So where are some interesting sticking points,
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:44.040]   some interesting disagreements,
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:45.700]   let's say with Annika first?
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:47.680]   Maybe there'll be a few other people.
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:49.720]   - Well, Annika and I just had a conversation this morning
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.560]   where we were talking about our ideas
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:53.840]   and what we discovered really in our conversation
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:57.080]   was that we're pretty much on the same page.
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:58.680]   It was really just--
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.520]   - About consciousness.
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:00.960]   - About consciousness, yeah.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.100]   Our ideas about consciousness
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:04.080]   are pretty much on the same page.
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:07.880]   She rightly has cautioned me to,
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:10.120]   when I talk about conscious agents,
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:12.040]   to point out that the notion of agency
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:15.000]   is not fundamental in my theory.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.280]   The notion of self is not fundamental
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:18.920]   and that's absolutely true.
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:21.720]   I can use this network of conscious agents,
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:25.040]   I now use as a technical term,
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:26.440]   conscious agents is a technical term
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:29.360]   for that probability space with the Markovian dynamics.
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:31.920]   I can use that to build models of a self
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:33.280]   and to build models of agency,
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:35.260]   but they're not fundamental.
[02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:40.260]   So she has really been very helpful
[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:43.640]   in helping me to be a little bit clear about these ideas
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:45.920]   and not say things that are misleading.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:47.200]   - Sure.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.440]   I mean, this is the interesting thing
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.040]   about language actually,
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:52.320]   is that language, quite obviously,
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:56.680]   is an interface to truth.
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.440]   It's so fascinating that individual words
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:05.320]   can have so much ambiguity
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:10.800]   and the specific choices of a word
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.160]   within a particular sentence,
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:13.640]   within the context of a sentence,
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:17.280]   can have such a difference in meaning.
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:18.640]   It's quite fascinating,
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:20.400]   especially when you're talking about topics
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:22.280]   like consciousness,
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:23.960]   because it's a very loaded term.
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:26.160]   It means a lot of things to a lot of people
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:29.160]   and the entire concept is shrouded in mystery.
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:32.480]   So combination of the fact that it's a loaded term
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:34.340]   and that there's a lot of mystery,
[02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:36.960]   people can just interpret it in all kinds of ways.
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:39.160]   And so you have to be both precise
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:43.640]   and help them avoid getting stuck
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:48.120]   on some kind of side road of miscommunication,
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:50.840]   lost in translation because you used the wrong word.
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:51.680]   That's interesting.
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:54.360]   I mean, 'cause for a lot of people,
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:59.100]   consciousness is ultimately connected to a self.
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:04.920]   I mean, our experience of consciousness
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:08.840]   is very, it's connected to this ego.
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:12.840]   I mean, I just, I mean, what else could it possibly be?
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:15.760]   I can't even, how do you begin to comprehend,
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:19.000]   to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.400]   that's not connected to this particular organism?
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:26.500]   - I'll have a way of thinking about this whole problem now
[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:29.680]   that comes out of this framework that's different.
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:34.260]   So we can imagine a dynamics of consciousness,
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:37.660]   not in space and time, just abstractly.
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:40.560]   It could be cooperative, for all we know.
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:42.560]   It could be very friendly, I don't know.
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:46.720]   And you can set up a dynamics, a Markovian dynamics
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:48.820]   that is so-called stationary.
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:50.160]   And that's a technical term,
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:53.400]   which means that the entropy effectively is not increasing.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:55.160]   There is some entropy, but it's constant.
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.960]   So there's no increasing entropy.
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.340]   And in that sense, the dynamics is timeless.
[02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:02.980]   There is no entropic time.
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:08.020]   But it's a trivial theorem, three-line proof,
[02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:12.080]   that if you have a stationary Markovian dynamics,
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:14.520]   any projection that you make of that dynamics
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:16.240]   by conditional probability,
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:17.960]   and if you want, I can state a little bit more,
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.360]   even more mathematically precisely
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.920]   for some readers or listeners.
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:25.120]   But if any projection you take by conditional probability,
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:28.980]   the induced image of that Markov chain
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:30.440]   will have increasing entropy.
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:34.080]   You will have entropic time.
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:36.160]   So I'll be very, very precise.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:40.720]   I'll have a Markov chain, X1, X2, through Xn,
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:42.380]   where Xn goes to infinity, right?
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:48.040]   The entropy H, capital H of Xn,
[02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:51.600]   is equal to the entropy H of Xn minus one for all n.
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:54.180]   So the entropy is the same.
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:05:00.660]   But it's a theorem that H of Xn, say, given X sub one,
[02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:09.480]   is greater than or equal to H of Xn minus one, given X1.
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:13.600]   - Sure, where does the greater come from?
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:15.940]   - Because, well, the three-line proof,
[02:05:15.940 --> 02:05:22.240]   H of Xn given X1 is greater than or equal to
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:27.520]   H of Xn given X1 and X2, because conditioning reduces.
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:33.760]   But then H of Xn minus one, given X1, X2,
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:39.640]   is equal to H of Xn, given X2,
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:43.080]   Xn minus one, given X2, by the Markov property.
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:46.220]   And then, because it's stationary,
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:51.220]   it's equal to H of X, I have to write it down, Xn minus.
[02:05:51.220 --> 02:05:54.080]   - Sure, sure.
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:54.920]   - I have to write it down.
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:56.800]   But anyway, there's a three-line proof.
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:57.640]   - Sure.
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:06:00.940]   But the assumption of stationarity,
[02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:04.040]   we're using a lot of terms that people won't understand.
[02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:05.740]   - Right, right. - Doesn't matter.
[02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:10.240]   So there's some kind of, Markovian dynamics
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:13.560]   is basically trying to model some kind of system
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:15.720]   with some probabilities, and there's agents,
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:17.280]   and they interact in some kind of way,
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:20.000]   and you can say something about that system
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.920]   as it evolves stationarity.
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:27.920]   So a stationary system is one that has certain properties
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:30.880]   in terms of entropy very well.
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:33.040]   But we don't know if it's stationary or not.
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:35.520]   We don't know what the properties.
[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:36.480]   - Right.
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:38.560]   - So you have to kind of take assumptions and see,
[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:42.040]   okay, well, what does the system behave like
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:43.560]   under these different properties?
[02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:46.360]   The more constraints, the more assumptions you take,
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:49.920]   the more interesting, powerful things you can say,
[02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:52.040]   but sometimes they're limiting.
[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:54.480]   That said, we're talking about consciousness here.
[02:06:54.480 --> 02:07:01.000]   How does that, you said cooperative, okay, competitive.
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:04.140]   It's just, I like chocolate.
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:08.500]   I'm sitting here, I have a brain, I'm wearing a suit.
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:11.180]   It sure as hell feels like I'm a self.
[02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:16.800]   What, am I tuning in, am I plugging into something?
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:20.700]   Am I a projection, a simple, trivial projection
[02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:23.980]   into space-time from some much larger organism
[02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:25.980]   that I can't possibly comprehend?
[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:28.020]   How the hell, you're saying some,
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:31.500]   you're building up mathematical intuitions, fine, great,
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:35.100]   but I'm just, I'm having an existential crisis here
[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:36.700]   and I'm gonna die soon.
[02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:37.940]   We'll all die pretty quickly,
[02:07:37.940 --> 02:07:42.220]   so I wanna figure out why chocolate's so delicious.
[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:44.200]   So help me out here.
[02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:47.100]   So let's just keep sneaking up to this.
[02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:52.100]   - Right, so the whole technical thing was to say this.
[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:56.220]   Even if the dynamics of consciousness is stationary
[02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:58.700]   so that there is no entropic time,
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:02.500]   any projection of it, any view of it
[02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:07.440]   will have the artifact of entropic time.
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:10.000]   That's a limited resource.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.220]   Limited resources, so that the fundamental dynamics
[02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:17.500]   may have no limited resources whatsoever.
[02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:19.980]   Any projection will have, certainly time
[02:08:19.980 --> 02:08:21.180]   is a limited resource,
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:24.140]   and probably lots of other limited resources.
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:28.140]   Hence, we could get competition and evolution
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:30.380]   and nature red in tooth and claw
[02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:32.700]   as an artifact of a deeper system
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:34.580]   in which those aren't fundamental.
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:37.820]   And in fact, I take it as something
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:41.020]   that this theory must do at some point
[02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:42.740]   is to show how networks of conscious agents,
[02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:45.660]   even if they're not resource limited,
[02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:47.620]   give rise to evolution by natural selection
[02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:49.340]   via a projection.
[02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:51.100]   - Yeah, but you're saying,
[02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:53.260]   I'm trying to understand how the limited resources
[02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:57.940]   that give rise to, so first the thing gives rise to time,
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:08:59.860]   it gives rise to limited resource,
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:03.140]   it gives rise to evolution by natural selection,
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:04.340]   how that has to do with the fact
[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:05.940]   that chocolate is delicious.
[02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:08.060]   - Well, it's not gonna do that directly,
[02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:10.700]   it's gonna get to this notion of self.
[02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:12.140]   - Oh, it's gonna give you--
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:12.980]   - The notion of self.
[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:14.700]   - Evolution gives you the notion of self.
[02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:18.420]   - And also of a self separate from other selves.
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:20.180]   So the idea would be that--
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:22.140]   - That's competition, has life and death,
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:23.300]   all those kinds of things.
[02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:25.020]   - That's right, so it won't,
[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:27.220]   I don't think, as I said,
[02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:29.780]   I don't think that I can tell you how the formless
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:32.380]   gives rise to the experience of chocolate.
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:33.660]   Right now my current theory says
[02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:35.700]   that's one of the miracles I'm assuming.
[02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:36.660]   - Yeah.
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:38.180]   - So my theory can't do it.
[02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:39.260]   And the reason my theory can't do it
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:41.260]   is 'cause Hoffman's brain can't do it right now.
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:42.940]   (laughing)
[02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:46.020]   But the notion of self, yes,
[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:49.100]   the notion of self can be an artifact
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:51.740]   of the projection of it.
[02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:53.800]   So there's one conscious agent,
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:56.820]   'cause anytime conscious agents interact,
[02:09:56.820 --> 02:09:57.900]   they form a new conscious agent.
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:09:59.460]   So there's one conscious agent.
[02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:02.700]   Any projection of that one conscious agent
[02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:06.220]   gives rise to time, even if there wasn't any time
[02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:07.820]   in that one conscious agent.
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:10.140]   And it gives rise, I want to,
[02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:11.660]   now I haven't proven this,
[02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:14.900]   so now this is me guessing where the theory's gonna go.
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:16.940]   I haven't done this, there's no paper on this yet.
[02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:18.440]   So now I'm speculating.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:20.260]   My guess is I'll be able to show,
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:22.500]   or my brighter colleagues working with me
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:25.340]   will be able to show that we will get
[02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:26.700]   evolution of a natural selection,
[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:28.300]   so notion of individual selves,
[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:29.940]   individual physical objects and so forth
[02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:31.660]   coming out as a projection of this thing.
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:35.900]   And that the self, this then will be really interesting
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:37.460]   in terms of how it starts to interact
[02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:41.020]   with certain spiritual traditions, right?
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:44.140]   Where they will say that there is a notion of self
[02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:46.900]   that needs to be let go, which is this finite self
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:48.340]   that's competing with other selves
[02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:52.060]   to get more money and prestige and so forth.
[02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:54.400]   That self in some sense has to die,
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:58.700]   but there's a deeper self, which is the timeless being
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:04.380]   that precedes, not precludes,
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:08.100]   but precedes any particular conscious experiences,
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:10.420]   the ground of all experience.
[02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:13.700]   That there's that notion of a deep capital self.
[02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:18.020]   But our little capital lowercase s selves
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:20.840]   could be artifacts of projection.
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:25.660]   And it may be that what consciousness is doing
[02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:26.820]   in this framework is, right,
[02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:30.340]   it's projected itself down into a self
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:33.940]   that calls itself Don and a self that calls itself Lex.
[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:36.060]   And through conversations like this,
[02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:37.940]   it's trying to find out about itself
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:41.220]   and eventually transcend the limits
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:45.860]   of the Don and Lex little icons that it's using
[02:11:45.860 --> 02:11:49.060]   and that little projection of itself.
[02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:50.600]   Through this conversation,
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:53.680]   somehow it's learning about itself.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:56.660]   - So that thing dressed me up today
[02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:59.960]   in order to understand itself.
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:02.240]   - And in some sense, you and I are not separate
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:03.940]   from that thing and we're not separate from each other.
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:06.000]   - Yeah, well, I have to question
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.480]   the fashion choices on my end then.
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:10.920]   All right, so you mentioned you agree
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:15.480]   in terms of consciousness on a lot of things with Anika.
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:20.260]   Is there somebody, friend or friendly foe
[02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:25.260]   that you disagree with in some nuanced, interesting way
[02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:28.580]   or some major way about consciousness,
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:33.140]   about these topics of reality that you return to often?
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:40.260]   It's like Christopher Hitchens with Rabbi David Wolpe
[02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:44.020]   have had interesting conversations through years
[02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:46.240]   that added to the complexity
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:47.640]   and the beauty of their friendship.
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:51.920]   Is there somebody like that that over the years
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:54.520]   has been a source of disagreement with you
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:56.520]   that's strengthened your ideas?
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:01.520]   - Hmm, my ideas have been really shaped by several things.
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:06.560]   One is the physicalist framework
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.420]   that my scientific colleagues, almost to a person,
[02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:12.780]   have adopted and that I adopted too.
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:15.400]   The reason I walked away from it was because
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:20.360]   it became clear that we couldn't start
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:22.840]   with unconscious ingredients and boot up consciousness.
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:27.840]   - Can you define physicalist in contrast to reductionist?
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:32.720]   - So a physicalist, I would say,
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:33.920]   as someone who takes space-time
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.880]   and the objects within space-time
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:38.860]   as ontologically fundamental.
[02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:42.040]   - Right, and then reductionist is saying
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:43.760]   the smaller, the more fundamental.
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:45.820]   - That's a methodological thing.
[02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:47.940]   That's saying within space-time,
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:50.540]   as you go to smaller and smaller scales in space,
[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:51.940]   you get deeper and deeper laws,
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:54.380]   more and more fundamental laws.
[02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:59.380]   And the reduction of temperature to particle movement
[02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:02.160]   was an example of that, but I think that
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:05.940]   the reason that worked was almost an artifact
[02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:07.980]   of the nature of our interface.
[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:10.340]   - That was for a long time, and your colleagues,
[02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:12.080]   including yourself, were physicalists,
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:13.520]   and now you broke away.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:15.680]   - Broke away because I think you can't start
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:18.480]   with unconscious ingredients and boot up consciousness.
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:19.580]   And--
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:23.880]   - So even with Roger Penrose, where there's a gray area.
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:26.880]   - Right, and here's the challenge I would put
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:30.040]   to all of my friends and colleagues
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:34.120]   who give one specific conscious experience
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:37.680]   that you can boot up.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:40.700]   So if you think that it's integrated information,
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:44.140]   and I've asked this of Giulio Tononi a couple times,
[02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:46.620]   back in the '90s and then just a couple years ago.
[02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:49.020]   I asked Giulio, okay, so great, integrated information.
[02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:51.540]   So we're all interested in explaining
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:53.180]   some specific conscious experiences,
[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:56.860]   so pick one, the taste of chocolate.
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:58.660]   What is the integrated information,
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:02.580]   precise structure that we need for chocolate,
[02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:05.820]   and why does that structure have to be for chocolate,
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:09.260]   and why is it that it could not possibly be vanilla?
[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:11.560]   Is there any, I asked him, is there any one specific
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.500]   conscious experience that you can account for?
[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:18.360]   Because notice, they've set themselves the task
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.440]   of booting up conscious experiences from physical systems.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:22.920]   That's the task they've set themselves.
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:24.520]   - But that doesn't mean they're,
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:26.840]   I understand your intuition,
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:28.280]   but that doesn't mean they're wrong
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:31.320]   just because they can't find a way to boot it up yet.
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:32.680]   - That's right, no, that doesn't mean that they're wrong,
[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:37.340]   it just means that they haven't done it.
[02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:39.980]   I think it's principled, the reason is principled,
[02:15:39.980 --> 02:15:43.060]   but I'm happy that they're exploring it.
[02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:45.060]   But the fact is, the remarkable fact is
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:48.400]   there's not one theory, so integrated information theory,
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:51.480]   orchestrated collapse of microtubules,
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:54.780]   global workspace theory.
[02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:56.260]   - These are all theories of consciousness.
[02:15:56.260 --> 02:15:57.740]   - These are all theories of consciousness.
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:01.020]   There's not a single theory that can give you
[02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:03.220]   a specific conscious experience, that they say,
[02:16:03.220 --> 02:16:06.680]   here is the physical dynamics or the physical structure
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:08.020]   that must be the taste of chocolate
[02:16:08.020 --> 02:16:09.100]   or whatever one they want.
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:11.180]   - So you're saying it's impossible,
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:13.040]   they're saying it's just hard.
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:18.040]   - Yeah, my attitude is, okay, no one said
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:20.540]   you had to start with neurons or physical systems
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:21.380]   and boot up consciousness.
[02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:22.200]   - You guys are just taking that--
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:23.500]   - You chose that problem.
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:26.080]   So since you chose that problem,
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:27.340]   how much progress have you made?
[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:30.060]   Well, when you've not been able to come up
[02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:33.020]   with a single specific conscious experience,
[02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:34.540]   and you've had these brilliant people
[02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:36.740]   working on it for decades now,
[02:16:36.740 --> 02:16:38.420]   that's not really good progress.
[02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:41.580]   - Let me ask you to play devil's advocate.
[02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:46.180]   Can you try to steel man, steel man meaning,
[02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:49.880]   argue the best possible case for reality,
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:51.480]   the opposite of your book title,
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:54.400]   or maybe just stick into consciousness,
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:57.020]   can you take the physicalist view?
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:16:58.820]   Can you steel man the physicalist view
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:01.780]   for a brief moment, playing devil's advocate too,
[02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:05.700]   or steel man the person you used to be?
[02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:07.220]   - Right, right. - She's a physicalist.
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:11.380]   What's a good, like saying that you might be wrong right now
[02:17:11.380 --> 02:17:16.420]   what would be a convincing argument for that?
[02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:21.180]   - Well, I think the argument I would give
[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:23.860]   and that I believed was, look,
[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:25.920]   when you have very simple physical systems,
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:27.560]   like a piece of dirt,
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:30.600]   there's not much evidence of life for consciousness.
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:32.800]   It's only when you get really complicated physical systems
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:34.600]   like that have brains,
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:36.400]   and really the more complicated the brains,
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:39.240]   the more it looks like there's consciousness,
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:41.200]   and the more complicated that consciousness is.
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:45.220]   Surely that means that simple physical systems
[02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:49.000]   don't create much consciousness, or if maybe not any,
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000]   or maybe if I'm a panpsychist,
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.320]   they create the most elementary kinds
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:54.120]   of simple conscious experiences.
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:57.700]   But you need more complicated physical systems
[02:17:57.700 --> 02:18:02.000]   to boot up, to create more complicated consciousnesses.
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.080]   I think that's the intuition
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:04.920]   that drives most of my colleagues.
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:09.000]   - And you're saying that this concept of complexity
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.200]   is ill-defined when you ground it to space-time.
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:15.680]   - I think it's well-defined
[02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:17.440]   within the framework of space-time, right?
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:21.100]   - No, it's ill-defined relative to what you need
[02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:23.220]   to actually understand consciousness
[02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:26.320]   because you're grounding complexity in space-time.
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:27.640]   - Oh, gotcha, right, right.
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:30.440]   Yeah, what I'm saying is,
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:35.560]   if it were true that space-time was fundamental,
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:38.040]   then I would have to agree
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:40.240]   that if there is such a thing as consciousness,
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:41.400]   given the data that we've got
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:45.880]   that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn't,
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:48.640]   that somehow it's the complexity of the dynamics
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:52.120]   or organization, the function of the physical system
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:54.260]   that somehow is creating the consciousness.
[02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:58.260]   So under those assumptions, yes.
[02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:00.080]   But when the physicists themselves are telling us
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:02.620]   that space-time is not fundamental,
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:03.700]   then I can understand.
[02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:07.020]   See, then the whole picture starts to come into focus.
[02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:10.020]   Why, my colleagues are brilliant, right?
[02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:12.020]   These are really smart people.
[02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:14.100]   I mean, Francis Crick worked on this
[02:19:14.100 --> 02:19:15.800]   for the last 20 years of his life.
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:17.860]   These are not stupid people.
[02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:19.720]   These are brilliant, brilliant people.
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:20.740]   The fact that we've come up
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:22.980]   with not a single specific conscious experience
[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:25.460]   that we can explain, and no hope.
[02:19:25.460 --> 02:19:27.420]   There's no one that says, "I'm really close.
[02:19:27.420 --> 02:19:29.180]   "I'll have it for you in a year."
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:33.280]   No, there's just like, there's this fundamental gap.
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:36.180]   So much so that Steve Pinker, in one of his writings,
[02:19:36.180 --> 02:19:39.860]   says, look, he likes the global workspace theory,
[02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:41.500]   but he says the last dollop of the theory,
[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:44.020]   in which there's something it's like to,
[02:19:44.020 --> 02:19:47.180]   he says we may have to just stipulate that as a brute fact.
[02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:52.020]   That's, I mean, Pinker is brilliant, right?
[02:19:52.020 --> 02:19:54.980]   He understands the state of play
[02:19:54.980 --> 02:19:57.340]   on this problem of the hard problem of consciousness,
[02:19:57.340 --> 02:20:00.860]   starting with physicalist assumptions,
[02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:02.620]   and then trying to boot up consciousness.
[02:20:02.620 --> 02:20:04.480]   So you've set yourself the problem.
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:07.860]   I'm starting with physical stuff that's not conscious.
[02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:11.340]   I'm trying to get the taste of chocolate out
[02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:14.860]   as maybe some kind of function of the dynamics of that.
[02:20:14.860 --> 02:20:16.020]   We've not been able to do that.
[02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:18.900]   And so Pinker is saying we may have to punt,
[02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:21.900]   we may have to just stipulate that last bit,
[02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:23.820]   he calls it the last dollop,
[02:20:23.820 --> 02:20:27.080]   and just stipulate it as a bare fact of nature
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:28.380]   that there is something it's like.
[02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:30.540]   Well, from my point of view as the,
[02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:33.020]   the whole point, the whole promise of the physicalist
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:34.500]   was we wouldn't have to stipulate.
[02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:36.460]   I was gonna start with the physical stuff
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:38.780]   and explain where the consciousness came from.
[02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:40.700]   If I'm going to stipulate consciousness,
[02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:42.580]   why don't I just stipulate consciousness
[02:20:42.580 --> 02:20:45.020]   and not stipulate all the physical stuff too?
[02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:46.860]   So I'm stipulating less.
[02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:47.700]   I'm saying, okay, I agree--
[02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:49.540]   - Which is the panpsychist perspective.
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:51.140]   - Well, it's actually what I call
[02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:52.620]   the conscious realist perspective.
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:53.780]   - Conscious realist.
[02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:55.880]   - Panpsychists are effectively dualists, right?
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:57.180]   They're saying there's physical stuff
[02:20:57.180 --> 02:21:00.020]   that really is fundamental, and then consciousness stuff.
[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:01.260]   So I would go with Pinker and say,
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:04.100]   look, let's just stipulate the consciousness stuff.
[02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:05.900]   But I'm not gonna stipulate the physical stuff.
[02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:08.100]   I'm gonna actually now show how to boot up
[02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:11.140]   the physical stuff from just the consciousness stuff.
[02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:12.340]   So I'll stipulate less.
[02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:15.180]   - Is it possible, so if you stipulate less,
[02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:20.180]   is it possible for our limited brains to visualize reality
[02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:25.660]   as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper?
[02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:27.940]   Is it possible to visualize somehow?
[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:31.020]   With the tools of math, with the tools of computers,
[02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:34.620]   with the tools of our mind, are we hopelessly lost?
[02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:37.700]   You said there's ways to intuit
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:44.320]   what's true using mathematics and probability
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:49.720]   and sort of Markovian dynamics, all that kind of stuff,
[02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:51.920]   but that's not visualizing.
[02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:55.880]   That's what's a kind of building intuition.
[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:58.480]   But is it possible to visualize in the way we visualize
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:02.320]   so nicely in space-time in four dimensions,
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:04.240]   in three dimensions, sorry?
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:06.560]   Well, we really are looking through
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:10.360]   a two-dimensional screen until what we intuit
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:12.720]   to be a three-dimensional world
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:17.320]   and also inferring dynamic stuff, making it 4D.
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:20.540]   Anyway, is it possible to visualize some pretty pictures
[02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:25.540]   that give us a deeper sense of the truth of reality?
[02:22:25.540 --> 02:22:29.640]   - I think that we will incrementally be able to do that.
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:33.680]   I think that, for example, the picture that we have
[02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:38.440]   of electrons and photons interacting and scattering,
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:43.360]   it may have not been possible
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:45.320]   until Faraday did all of his experiments
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:47.280]   and then Maxwell wrote down his equations.
[02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:50.160]   And we were then sort of forced by his equations
[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:51.940]   to think in a new way.
[02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:55.920]   And then when Planck in 1900,
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:23:00.920]   desperate to try to solve the problem
[02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:01.920]   of black-body radiation,
[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:03.840]   what they call the ultraviolet catastrophe
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:08.320]   where Newton was predicting infinite energies,
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:09.800]   where there weren't infinite energies
[02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:11.460]   in black-body radiation.
[02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:16.460]   And he, in desperation, proposed packets of energy.
[02:23:16.460 --> 02:23:23.060]   Then once you've done that,
[02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:25.280]   and then you have an Einstein come along five years later
[02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:29.360]   and show how that explains the photoelectric effect.
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:33.560]   And then eventually in 1926, you get quantum theory.
[02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:35.320]   And then you get this whole new way of thinking
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:38.360]   that was, from the Newtonian point of view,
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:43.360]   completely contradictory and counterintuitive, certainly.
[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:47.680]   And maybe if Gieson is right, not contradictory.
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:49.880]   Maybe if you use intuitionist math,
[02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:52.400]   they're not contradictory, but still.
[02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:54.440]   Certainly you wouldn't have gone there.
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:57.740]   And so here's a case where the experiments
[02:23:57.740 --> 02:24:00.600]   and then a desperate mathematical move,
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:05.900]   sort of we use those as a flashlight into the deep fog.
[02:24:05.900 --> 02:24:12.200]   And so that science may be the flashlight into the deep fog.
[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:16.220]   - I wonder if it's still possible to visualize,
[02:24:16.220 --> 02:24:21.480]   we talk about consciousness from a self-perspective,
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:25.700]   experience it, hold that idea in our mind,
[02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:27.820]   where you can experience things directly.
[02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:32.260]   We've evolved to experience things in this 3D world.
[02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:35.960]   And that's a very rich experience.
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:38.040]   When you're thinking mathematically,
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:42.380]   you still, in the end of the day,
[02:24:42.380 --> 02:24:47.380]   have to project it down to a low dimensional space
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:49.680]   to make conclusions.
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:51.920]   Your conclusions will be a number,
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:56.060]   or a line, or a plot, or a visual.
[02:24:56.060 --> 02:25:00.140]   So I wonder how we can really touch some deep truth
[02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:03.740]   in a subjective way, like experience it,
[02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:05.900]   really feel the beauty of it,
[02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:08.540]   in the way that humans feel beauty.
[02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:10.960]   - Right, are we screwed?
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:11.800]   I don't think we're screwed.
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:14.420]   I think that we get little hints of it
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:17.540]   from psychedelic drugs and so forth.
[02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:19.680]   We get hints that there are certain interventions
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:21.420]   that we can take on our interface.
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:22.700]   I apply this chemical,
[02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:25.940]   which is just some element of my interface,
[02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:29.720]   to this other, to a brain, I ingest it.
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:33.440]   And all of a sudden, I seem like I've opened new portals
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:36.340]   into conscious experiences.
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:38.320]   Well, that's very, very suggestive.
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:40.980]   That's like the black body radiation
[02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:42.700]   doing something that we didn't expect, right?
[02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:44.040]   It doesn't go to infinity
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:45.420]   when we thought it was gonna go to infinity,
[02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:49.220]   and we're forced to propose these quanta.
[02:25:49.220 --> 02:25:52.220]   So once we have a theory of conscious agents,
[02:25:52.220 --> 02:25:55.100]   and is projection into space,
[02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:56.700]   and I should say, I should sketch
[02:25:56.700 --> 02:25:58.300]   what I think that projection is.
[02:25:58.300 --> 02:26:01.740]   But then I think we can then start
[02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:03.500]   to ask specific questions.
[02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:06.820]   When you're taking DMT,
[02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:09.720]   or you're taking LSD or something like that,
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:12.940]   now that we have this deep model,
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:14.580]   we've reverse engineered space and time
[02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:16.140]   and physical particles,
[02:26:16.140 --> 02:26:18.540]   we've pulled them back to this theory of conscious agents.
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:22.020]   Now we can ask ourselves in this idealized future,
[02:26:22.020 --> 02:26:25.100]   what are we doing to conscious agents
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:28.220]   when we apply 5-MeO DMT?
[02:26:28.220 --> 02:26:29.860]   What are we doing?
[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:31.420]   Are we opening a new portal?
[02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:33.720]   So when I say that, I mean,
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:35.940]   I have a portal into consciousness
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:39.200]   that I call my body of Lex Friedman that I'm creating.
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:41.820]   And it's a genuine portal, not perfect,
[02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:42.960]   but it's a genuine portal.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:45.980]   I'm definitely communicating with your consciousness.
[02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:49.340]   And we know that we have one technology
[02:26:49.340 --> 02:26:51.420]   for building new portals.
[02:26:51.420 --> 02:26:53.820]   We know one technology, and that is having kids.
[02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:59.180]   Having kids is how we build new portals into consciousness.
[02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:00.100]   It takes a long time.
[02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:01.380]   - Can you elaborate that?
[02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:03.980]   Oh, oh, oh, you mean like-
[02:27:03.980 --> 02:27:07.220]   - Your son and your daughter didn't exist.
[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:08.300]   That was a portal.
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:10.460]   You're having contact with consciousness
[02:27:10.460 --> 02:27:12.380]   that you never would have had before.
[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:14.740]   But now you've got a son or a daughter.
[02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:16.940]   You went through this physical process.
[02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:19.980]   They were born, then you, there was all the-
[02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:22.780]   - But is that portal yours?
[02:27:22.780 --> 02:27:25.340]   So when you have kids, are you creating new portals
[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:27.340]   that are completely distinct from the portals
[02:27:27.340 --> 02:27:29.340]   that you've created with other consciousness?
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:31.340]   Like, can you elaborate on that?
[02:27:31.340 --> 02:27:34.540]   To which degree are the consciousness of your kids
[02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:37.380]   a part of you?
[02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:39.740]   - Well, so every person that I see,
[02:27:39.740 --> 02:27:43.140]   that symbol that I see, the body that I see,
[02:27:43.140 --> 02:27:45.940]   is a portal, potentially,
[02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:48.260]   for me to interact with the consciousness.
[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:49.100]   - Yeah.
[02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:53.620]   - And each consciousness has a unique character.
[02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:56.260]   We call it a personality, and so forth.
[02:27:56.260 --> 02:27:59.900]   So with each new kid that's born,
[02:27:59.900 --> 02:28:01.980]   we come in contact with a personality
[02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:03.700]   that we've never seen before,
[02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:05.700]   and a version of consciousness
[02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:06.980]   that we've never seen before.
[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:08.660]   At a deeper level, as I said,
[02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:10.500]   the theory says there's one agent.
[02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:12.780]   So this is a different projection
[02:28:12.780 --> 02:28:14.660]   of that one agent.
[02:28:14.660 --> 02:28:18.900]   So that's what I mean by a portal is,
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:22.980]   within my own interface, my own projection,
[02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:26.180]   can I see other projections
[02:28:26.180 --> 02:28:29.780]   of that one consciousness?
[02:28:29.780 --> 02:28:32.100]   So can I get portals in that sense?
[02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:36.460]   So I think we will get a theory of that,
[02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:38.220]   that we will get a theory of portals,
[02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:41.460]   and then we can ask how the psychedelics are acting.
[02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:44.140]   Are they actually creating new portals, or not?
[02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:46.860]   If they're not, we should, nevertheless,
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:50.220]   then understand how we could create a new portal.
[02:28:50.220 --> 02:28:51.860]   Maybe we have to just study what happens
[02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:53.660]   when we have kids.
[02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:57.380]   We know that that technology creates new portals.
[02:28:57.380 --> 02:28:58.900]   So we have to reverse engineer that,
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:01.380]   and then say, okay, could we somehow
[02:29:01.380 --> 02:29:06.340]   create new portals de novo?
[02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:07.180]   With that view, once we understand--
[02:29:07.180 --> 02:29:10.860]   - With something like brain-computer interfaces,
[02:29:10.860 --> 02:29:11.900]   for example. - Yeah, or maybe just
[02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:12.740]   a chemical or something.
[02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:14.580]   It's probably more complicated than a chemical.
[02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:17.620]   That's why I think that the psychedelics may,
[02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:19.580]   because they might be affecting this portal
[02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:22.860]   in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up.
[02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:24.580]   In other words, maybe once we understand
[02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:27.380]   what this thing is, a portal, your body is a portal,
[02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:28.620]   and understand all of its complexities,
[02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:31.500]   maybe we'll realize that that portal can be shifted
[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:34.340]   to different parts of the deeper consciousness,
[02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:36.420]   and give new windows on it.
[02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:38.860]   And so in that way, maybe, yes,
[02:29:38.860 --> 02:29:41.180]   psychedelics could open up new portals
[02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:42.300]   in the sense that they're taking something
[02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:45.980]   that's already a complex portal and just tweaking it a bit.
[02:29:45.980 --> 02:29:48.620]   - Well, but creating is a very powerful difference
[02:29:48.620 --> 02:29:50.540]   between morphing.
[02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:53.900]   - Right, right, tweaking versus creating, I agree.
[02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:55.780]   - But maybe it gives you intuition
[02:29:55.780 --> 02:29:58.840]   to at least the full space of the kinds of things
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:01.060]   that this particular system is capable of.
[02:30:01.060 --> 02:30:04.300]   I mean, the idea, the idea that consciousness
[02:30:04.300 --> 02:30:07.460]   creates brains, I mean, that breaks my brain,
[02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:12.220]   because, you know, I guess I'm still a physicalist
[02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:14.180]   in that sense, 'cause you could,
[02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:19.100]   it's just much easier to intuit the world.
[02:30:19.100 --> 02:30:21.740]   It's very, it's practical to think,
[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:25.660]   there's a neural network, and what are the different ways
[02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:30.660]   fascinating capabilities can emerge
[02:30:30.660 --> 02:30:32.300]   from this neural network?
[02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:34.380]   - I agree, it's easier.
[02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:37.700]   And so you start to, and then present to yourself
[02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:40.820]   the problem of, okay, well, how does consciousness arise?
[02:30:40.820 --> 02:30:42.900]   How does intelligence arise?
[02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:46.540]   How does emotion arise?
[02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:49.780]   How does memory arise in the,
[02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:52.540]   how do we filter within this system
[02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:54.940]   all the incoming sensory information
[02:30:54.940 --> 02:30:57.620]   we're able to allocate attention
[02:30:57.620 --> 02:30:58.740]   in different, interesting ways?
[02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:00.720]   How do all those mechanisms arise?
[02:31:02.020 --> 02:31:04.100]   To say that there's other fundamental things
[02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:06.540]   we don't understand outside of space-time
[02:31:06.540 --> 02:31:10.020]   that are actually core to how this whole thing works
[02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:14.060]   is a bit paralyzing, because it's like,
[02:31:14.060 --> 02:31:19.060]   oh, we're not 10% done, we're like 0.001% done,
[02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:22.700]   is the immediate feeling.
[02:31:22.700 --> 02:31:24.380]   - I certainly understand that.
[02:31:24.380 --> 02:31:29.380]   My attitude about it is, if you look at the young physicists
[02:31:29.740 --> 02:31:32.580]   who are searching for these structures beyond space-time,
[02:31:32.580 --> 02:31:37.320]   like Amplitude and so forth, they're having a ball.
[02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:41.340]   Space-time, that's what the old folks did.
[02:31:41.340 --> 02:31:44.340]   That's what the older generation did.
[02:31:44.340 --> 02:31:48.540]   We're doing something that really is fun and new,
[02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:51.900]   and they're having a blast,
[02:31:51.900 --> 02:31:53.860]   and they're finding all these new structures.
[02:31:53.860 --> 02:31:57.660]   So I think that we're going to succeed
[02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:03.500]   in getting a new, deeper theory.
[02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:04.540]   I can just say what I'm hoping
[02:32:04.540 --> 02:32:06.540]   with the theory that I'm working on.
[02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:09.060]   I'm hoping to show that I could have
[02:32:09.060 --> 02:32:12.740]   this timeless dynamics of consciousness, no entropic time.
[02:32:12.740 --> 02:32:16.240]   I take a projection, and I show how this timeless dynamics
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:17.760]   looks like the Big Bang,
[02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:21.860]   and the entire evolution of space-time.
[02:32:21.860 --> 02:32:25.140]   In other words, I see how my whole space-time interface.
[02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:27.980]   - So not just the projection,
[02:32:27.980 --> 02:32:29.780]   doesn't just look like space-time.
[02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:32.660]   You can explain the whole,
[02:32:32.660 --> 02:32:34.420]   from the origin of the universe.
[02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:35.740]   - That's what we have to do,
[02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:37.060]   and that's what the physicists understand.
[02:32:37.060 --> 02:32:39.220]   When they go beyond space-time to the amplitude
[02:32:39.220 --> 02:32:40.980]   and the cosmological polytope,
[02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:43.180]   they ultimately know that they have to get back
[02:32:43.180 --> 02:32:46.580]   the Big Bang story and the whole evolution,
[02:32:46.580 --> 02:32:49.380]   that whole story where there were no living things.
[02:32:49.380 --> 02:32:53.660]   There was just a point, and then the explosion,
[02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:55.580]   and then just particles at high energy,
[02:32:55.580 --> 02:32:57.020]   and then eventually the cooling down
[02:32:57.020 --> 02:33:01.780]   and the differentiation, and finally matter condenses,
[02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:03.520]   and then life, and then consciousness.
[02:33:03.520 --> 02:33:05.780]   That whole story has to come out of something
[02:33:05.780 --> 02:33:07.860]   that's deeper and without time,
[02:33:07.860 --> 02:33:09.660]   and that's what we're up to.
[02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:14.480]   So the whole story that we've been telling ourselves
[02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:17.140]   about Big Bang and how brains evolve in consciousness
[02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:19.100]   will come out of a much deeper theory.
[02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:23.340]   For someone like me, it's a lot.
[02:33:23.340 --> 02:33:26.940]   I mean, but for the younger generation,
[02:33:26.940 --> 02:33:30.740]   this is like, oh, wow, all the low chariots aren't picked.
[02:33:30.740 --> 02:33:31.860]   This is really good stuff.
[02:33:31.860 --> 02:33:35.340]   This is really new, fundamental stuff that we can do.
[02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:38.220]   So I can't wait to read the papers
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:41.900]   of the younger generation, and I wanna see them.
[02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:48.820]   - Kids these days with their non-space-time assumptions.
[02:33:48.820 --> 02:33:51.660]   It's just interesting looking at the philosophical tradition
[02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:53.780]   of this difficult ideas you struggle with.
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:57.660]   If you look like somebody like Immanuel Kant,
[02:33:57.660 --> 02:34:00.300]   what are some interesting agreements and disagreements
[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:04.900]   you have with a guy about the nature of reality?
[02:34:04.900 --> 02:34:06.900]   - So there's a lot in agreement.
[02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:10.980]   So Kant was an idealist, transcendental idealist,
[02:34:10.980 --> 02:34:15.540]   and he basically had the idea that
[02:34:15.540 --> 02:34:19.340]   we don't see nature as it is.
[02:34:19.340 --> 02:34:21.160]   We impose a structure on nature.
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:26.160]   And so in some sense, I'm saying something similar.
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:31.680]   I'm saying that, by the way, I don't call myself an idealist.
[02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:33.520]   I call myself a conscious realist
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:35.640]   because idealism has a long history.
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:38.440]   A lot of different ideas come under idealism,
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:40.560]   and there's a lot of debates and so forth.
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:44.560]   It tends to be identified with, in many cases,
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:46.680]   anti-science and anti-realism.
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:49.400]   And I don't want either connection with my ideas.
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:51.560]   And so I just called mine conscious realism
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:55.500]   with an emphasis on realism and not anti-realism.
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:59.680]   But one place where I would, of course, disagree with Kant
[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:04.680]   was that he thought that Euclidean space-time was a priori.
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:07.260]   We just know that that's false.
[02:35:07.260 --> 02:35:11.920]   So he went too far on that.
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:16.240]   But in general, the idea that we don't start with space-time,
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:17.800]   that space and time is, in some sense,
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:20.440]   forms of our perceptions, yes, absolutely.
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:25.680]   And I would say that there's a lot in common
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:27.320]   with Berkeley in that regard.
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:31.760]   There's a lot of ingenious arguments in Berkeley.
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:36.760]   Leibniz, in his monadology, understood very clearly
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:39.160]   that the hard problem was not solvable.
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:42.200]   He posed the hard problem and basically dismissed it,
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:44.040]   and just said, "You can't do this."
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:47.360]   And so if he came here and saw where we are,
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:50.360]   he'd say, "Look, guys, I told you this 300 years ago."
[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:51.560]   And he had his monadology.
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:54.200]   He was trying to do something like,
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:57.220]   it's different from what I'm doing,
[02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:59.840]   but he had these things that were not in space and time,
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:00.680]   these monads.
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:02.280]   He was trying to build something.
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:05.580]   I'm trying to build a theory of conscious agents.
[02:36:05.580 --> 02:36:08.480]   My guess is that if he came here,
[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:10.480]   I could just, if he saw what I was doing,
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:13.080]   he would say, he would understand it
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:15.120]   and immediately take off with it
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:17.040]   and go places that I couldn't.
[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:19.760]   He would have no problem with it.
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:23.560]   - Right, there would be overlap of the spirit of the ideas.
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:24.400]   - Absolutely. - It would be
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:25.480]   totally overlapping.
[02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:26.880]   - But his genius would then just run with it
[02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:28.080]   far faster than I could.
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:29.840]   - I love the humility here.
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:32.620]   So let me ask you about sort of practical implications
[02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:36.440]   of your ideas to our world, our complicated world.
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:38.800]   When you look at the big questions of humanity,
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:43.800]   of hate, war, what else is there?
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:51.480]   Evil, maybe there's the positive aspects of that,
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:53.340]   of meaning, of love.
[02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:59.120]   What is the fact that reality is an illusion?
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:05.320]   Perceived, what is the conscious realism
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:07.500]   when applied to daily life?
[02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:09.300]   What kind of impact does it have?
[02:37:09.300 --> 02:37:12.320]   - A lot, and it's sort of scary.
[02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:17.120]   We all know that life is ephemeral
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:20.300]   and spiritual traditions have said,
[02:37:20.300 --> 02:37:22.640]   wake up to the fact that anything that you do here
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:24.480]   is going to disappear.
[02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:27.960]   But it's even more ephemeral than perhaps we've thought.
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:30.880]   I see this bottle because I create it right now.
[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:33.680]   As soon as I look away,
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:36.080]   that data structure has been garbage collected.
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:38.880]   That bottle, I have to recreate it every time I look.
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:41.320]   So I spend all my money and I buy this fancy car.
[02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:44.360]   That car, I have to keep recreating it
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:45.200]   every time I look at it.
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:46.560]   It's that ephemeral.
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:50.200]   So all the things that we invest ourselves in,
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:52.320]   we fight over, we kill each other over,
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:53.440]   we have wars over.
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:56.560]   These are all, it's just like people
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:58.400]   in a virtual reality simulation.
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:03.800]   And there's this Porsche and we all see the Porsche.
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:07.080]   Well, that Porsche exists when I look at it.
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:09.080]   I turn my headset and I look at it.
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:12.080]   And then if Joe turns his headset the right way,
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:13.840]   he'll see his Porsche.
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:15.280]   It's not even the same Porsche that I see.
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:16.780]   He's creating his own Porsche.
[02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:20.480]   So these things are exceedingly ephemeral.
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:25.480]   And now, just imagine saying that that's my Porsche.
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:29.320]   Well, you can agree to say that it's your Porsche,
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:32.840]   but really, the Porsche only exists as long as you look.
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:34.600]   So this all of a sudden,
[02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:36.560]   what the spiritual traditions have been saying
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:38.200]   for a long, long time,
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:41.360]   this gets cashed out in mathematically precise science.
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:43.920]   It's saying ephemeral, yes, in fact,
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:45.840]   it lasts for a few milliseconds,
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:47.440]   a few hundred milliseconds while you look at it,
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:48.720]   and then it's gone.
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:51.560]   So the whole idea,
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:54.200]   why are we fighting?
[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:55.060]   Why do we hate?
[02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:59.800]   We fight over possessions
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:05.160]   because we think that we're small little objects
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:07.780]   inside this pre-existing space-time.
[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:11.200]   We assume that that mansion and that car
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:12.940]   exists independent of us,
[02:39:12.940 --> 02:39:16.040]   and that somehow we, these little things,
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:20.000]   can have our sense of self and importance enhanced
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:21.800]   by having that special car or that special house
[02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:23.700]   or that special person.
[02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:26.960]   When in fact, it's just the opposite.
[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:29.160]   You create that mansion every time you look.
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:32.960]   You're something far deeper than that mansion.
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:37.100]   You're the entity which can create that mansion on the fly.
[02:39:37.100 --> 02:39:39.820]   And there's nothing to the mansion
[02:39:39.820 --> 02:39:41.620]   except what you create in this moment.
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:45.560]   So all of a sudden, when you take this point of view,
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:49.540]   it has all sorts of implications
[02:39:49.540 --> 02:39:51.580]   for how we interact with each other,
[02:39:51.580 --> 02:39:53.320]   how we treat each other.
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:58.700]   And again, a lot of things
[02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:00.660]   that spiritual traditions have said,
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:02.580]   it's a mixed bag.
[02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:03.700]   Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag.
[02:40:03.700 --> 02:40:05.060]   So let me just be right up front about that.
[02:40:05.060 --> 02:40:06.740]   I'm not promoting any particular,
[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:08.380]   but they do have some insights.
[02:40:08.380 --> 02:40:09.500]   - Yeah, they have wisdom.
[02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:11.100]   - They have certain wisdom.
[02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:12.780]   I can point to nonsense, I won't go into it,
[02:40:12.780 --> 02:40:14.460]   but I can also point to lots of nonsense.
[02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:19.300]   So the issue is to then to look for the key insights.
[02:40:19.300 --> 02:40:21.600]   And I think they have a lot of insights
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:25.540]   about the ephemeral nature of objects in space and time
[02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:28.780]   and not being attached to them, including our own bodies,
[02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:31.640]   and reversing that I'm not this little thing,
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:33.660]   a little consciousness trapped in the body.
[02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:36.060]   And the consciousness itself is only a product of the body.
[02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:38.900]   So when the body dies, the consciousness disappears.
[02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:40.680]   It turns completely around.
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:42.380]   The consciousness is fundamental.
[02:40:42.380 --> 02:40:46.420]   The body, my hand exists right now
[02:40:46.420 --> 02:40:47.940]   because I'm looking at it.
[02:40:47.940 --> 02:40:48.820]   My hand is gone.
[02:40:48.820 --> 02:40:50.660]   I have no hand.
[02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:52.140]   I have no brain.
[02:40:52.140 --> 02:40:53.220]   I have no heart.
[02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:55.400]   If you looked, you'll see a heart.
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:41:00.100]   Whatever I am is this really complicated thing
[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:01.260]   in consciousness.
[02:41:01.260 --> 02:41:02.440]   That's what I am.
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:05.660]   All the stuff that I thought I was
[02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:07.540]   is something that I create on the fly and delete.
[02:41:07.540 --> 02:41:11.940]   So this is completely a radical restructuring
[02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:15.020]   of how we think about possessions,
[02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:20.020]   about identity, about survival of death, and so forth.
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:22.760]   This is completely transformative.
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:24.900]   But the nice thing is that this whole approach
[02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:27.680]   of conscious agents, unlike the spiritual traditions,
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:30.680]   which have said in some cases similar things,
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:32.080]   they've said it imprecisely.
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:34.920]   This is mathematics.
[02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:38.260]   We can actually now begin to state precisely,
[02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:40.180]   here's the mathematical model of consciousness,
[02:41:40.180 --> 02:41:41.140]   conscious agents.
[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:42.420]   Here's how it maps onto space-time,
[02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:44.620]   which I should sketch really briefly.
[02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:50.360]   And here's why things are ephemeral.
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:52.680]   And here's why you shouldn't be worried
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:54.040]   about the ephemeral nature of things,
[02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:57.300]   because you're not a little tiny entity
[02:41:57.300 --> 02:41:59.180]   inside space and time.
[02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:02.240]   Quite the opposite, you're the author of space and time.
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:06.100]   The I and the am and the I am is all kind of emerging
[02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:09.040]   through this whole process of evolution and so on
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:12.360]   that's just surface waves,
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:13.700]   and there's a much deeper ocean
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:15.280]   that we're trying to figure out here.
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:16.900]   So how does, you said,
[02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:18.820]   you said some of the stuff you're thinking about
[02:42:18.820 --> 02:42:19.840]   maps to space-time.
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:21.180]   How does it map to space-time?
[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:25.220]   - So just a very, very high level, and I'll keep it brief.
[02:42:25.220 --> 02:42:28.140]   The structures that the physicists are finding,
[02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:29.940]   like the Amplituhedron,
[02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:32.100]   it turns out they're just static structure.
[02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:33.120]   They're polytopes.
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:37.860]   But they, remarkably, most of the information in them
[02:42:37.860 --> 02:42:40.440]   is contained in permutation matrices.
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:45.720]   So it's a matrix, like an end by end matrix
[02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:47.180]   that just has zeros and ones.
[02:42:47.180 --> 02:42:51.940]   That contains almost all of the information.
[02:42:51.940 --> 02:42:54.680]   And you can, they have these plavit graphs and so forth
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:56.780]   that they use to boot up the scattering.
[02:42:56.780 --> 02:42:59.020]   You can compute those scattering amplitudes
[02:42:59.020 --> 02:43:02.100]   almost entirely from these permutation matrices.
[02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:07.200]   So that's just, now from my point of view,
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:09.340]   I have this conscious agent dynamics.
[02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:12.020]   It turns out that the stationary dynamics
[02:43:12.020 --> 02:43:13.700]   that I was talking about,
[02:43:13.700 --> 02:43:15.900]   where the entropy is increasing,
[02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:19.700]   all the stationary dynamics are sketched out
[02:43:19.700 --> 02:43:22.400]   by permutation matrices.
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:27.700]   So if you, there's so-called Birkhoff polytope.
[02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:29.780]   All the vertices of this polytope,
[02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:33.260]   all the points are permutation matrices.
[02:43:33.260 --> 02:43:37.460]   All the internal points are Markovian kernels
[02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:42.620]   that have the uniform measure as a stationary measure.
[02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:44.340]   - I need to intuit a little better
[02:43:44.340 --> 02:43:46.140]   what the heck you're talking about.
[02:43:46.140 --> 02:43:51.140]   But so basically, there's some complicated thing going on
[02:43:51.140 --> 02:43:54.580]   with the network of conscious agents,
[02:43:54.580 --> 02:43:56.580]   and that's mappable to this,
[02:43:56.580 --> 02:43:58.540]   you're saying a two-dimensional matrix
[02:43:58.540 --> 02:44:02.060]   that scattering has to do with what,
[02:44:02.060 --> 02:44:05.300]   with our perception, like that's like photon stuff.
[02:44:05.300 --> 02:44:06.500]   I mean, I don't know if it's useful
[02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:09.660]   to sort of dig into detail.
[02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:11.020]   - I'll do just a high-level thing.
[02:44:11.020 --> 02:44:11.860]   - Yes.
[02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:15.540]   - So the high level is the long-term behavior
[02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:17.000]   of the conscious agent dynamics.
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:17.940]   So that's the projection.
[02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:20.660]   Just looking at the long-term behavior,
[02:44:20.660 --> 02:44:23.820]   I'm hoping will give rise to the amplituhedron.
[02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:27.700]   The amplituhedron then gives rise to space-time.
[02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:29.860]   So then I can just use their link
[02:44:29.860 --> 02:44:31.140]   to go all the way from consciousness
[02:44:31.140 --> 02:44:34.260]   through its asymptotics through the amplituhedron
[02:44:34.260 --> 02:44:36.020]   into space-time and get the map
[02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:37.820]   all the way into our interface.
[02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:39.660]   - And that's why you mentioned the permutation matrix,
[02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:42.420]   'cause it gives you a nice thing to try to generate.
[02:44:42.420 --> 02:44:44.500]   - That's right, it's the connection with the amplituhedron.
[02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:47.420]   The permutation matrices are the core of the amplituhedron,
[02:44:47.420 --> 02:44:49.120]   and it turns out they're the core
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:52.300]   of the asymptotic description of the conscious agents.
[02:44:52.300 --> 02:44:54.820]   - So not to sort of bring up the idea of a creator,
[02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:57.820]   but I like, first of all, I like video games,
[02:44:57.820 --> 02:45:01.140]   and you mentioned this kind of simulation idea.
[02:45:01.140 --> 02:45:03.100]   First of all, do you think of it as an interesting idea,
[02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:05.860]   this thought experiment that will live in a simulation?
[02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:10.360]   And in general, do you think will live in a simulation?
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:14.300]   - So Nick Bostrom's idea about the simulation
[02:45:14.300 --> 02:45:17.880]   is typically couched in a physicalist framework.
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:18.800]   - Yes.
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:20.980]   - So there is the bottom level.
[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:24.260]   There's some programmer in a physical space time,
[02:45:24.260 --> 02:45:25.700]   and they have a computer that they've programmed
[02:45:25.700 --> 02:45:29.680]   really cleverly, where they've created conscious entities.
[02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:32.660]   So you have the hard problem of consciousness, right?
[02:45:32.660 --> 02:45:33.540]   The standard hard problem,
[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:36.640]   how could a computer simulation create a consciousness?
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:39.080]   Which isn't explained by that simulation theory.
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:41.660]   But then the idea is that the next level,
[02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:46.660]   the entities that are created in the first level simulation
[02:45:46.660 --> 02:45:48.060]   then can write their own simulations,
[02:45:48.060 --> 02:45:49.420]   and you get this nesting.
[02:45:50.420 --> 02:45:55.420]   So the idea that this is a simulation is fine,
[02:45:55.420 --> 02:45:58.580]   but the idea that it starts with a physical space,
[02:45:58.580 --> 02:46:00.060]   I think, isn't fine.
[02:46:00.060 --> 02:46:01.820]   - Well, there's different properties here,
[02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:03.700]   the partial rendering.
[02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:07.180]   I mean, to me, that's the interesting idea
[02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:11.300]   is not whether the entirety of the universe is simulated,
[02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:15.140]   but how efficiently can you create interfaces
[02:46:17.900 --> 02:46:21.780]   that are convincing to all other entities
[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:24.060]   that can appreciate such interfaces?
[02:46:24.060 --> 02:46:25.900]   How little does it take?
[02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:27.900]   'Cause you said partial rendering,
[02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:31.780]   or temporal, ephemeral rendering of stuff.
[02:46:31.780 --> 02:46:33.900]   Only render the tree falling in the forest
[02:46:33.900 --> 02:46:36.340]   when there's somebody there to see it.
[02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:38.260]   It's interesting to think,
[02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:39.780]   how can you do that super efficiently
[02:46:39.780 --> 02:46:41.380]   without having to render everything?
[02:46:41.380 --> 02:46:44.440]   And that, to me, is one perspective on the simulation,
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:46.740]   just like it is with video games,
[02:46:46.740 --> 02:46:48.260]   where a video game doesn't have to render
[02:46:48.260 --> 02:46:49.500]   every single thing.
[02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:52.300]   It's just the thing that the observer is looking at.
[02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:53.140]   - Right.
[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:55.580]   There is actually, that's a very nice question,
[02:46:55.580 --> 02:46:58.060]   and there's whole groups of researchers
[02:46:58.060 --> 02:47:00.660]   that are actually studying in virtual reality,
[02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:05.660]   what is the sort of minimal requirements on the system?
[02:47:05.660 --> 02:47:07.760]   How does it have to operate
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:09.820]   to give you an immersion experience,
[02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:12.600]   to give you the feeling that you have a body,
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:14.300]   to get you to take it real?
[02:47:14.300 --> 02:47:15.980]   And there's actually a lot of really good work
[02:47:15.980 --> 02:47:16.820]   on that right now,
[02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:18.180]   and it turns out it doesn't take that much.
[02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:21.580]   You do need to get the perception action loop tight,
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:25.100]   and you have to give them the perceptions
[02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:26.940]   that they're expecting, if you want them to.
[02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:30.080]   But if you, you can lead them along.
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:31.140]   If you give them perceptions
[02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:32.320]   that are close to what they're expecting,
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:35.460]   you can then maybe move their reality around a bit.
[02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:36.940]   - Yeah, it's a tricky engineering problem,
[02:47:36.940 --> 02:47:39.340]   especially when you're trying to create a product
[02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:41.260]   that costs little, but that's,
[02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:42.980]   it feels like an engineering problem,
[02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:44.580]   not a deeply scientific problem.
[02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:47.660]   Or meaning, obviously, it's a scientific problem,
[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:49.060]   but as a scientific problem,
[02:47:49.060 --> 02:47:53.300]   it's not that difficult to trick us descendants of apes.
[02:47:53.300 --> 02:47:55.660]   - But here's a case for just us,
[02:47:55.660 --> 02:47:57.500]   in our own, if this is a virtual reality
[02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:58.540]   that we're experiencing right now.
[02:47:58.540 --> 02:48:01.680]   So here's something you can try for yourself.
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:03.020]   If you just close your eyes
[02:48:03.020 --> 02:48:08.740]   and look at your experience in front of you,
[02:48:08.740 --> 02:48:09.900]   be aware of your experience in front of you,
[02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:14.020]   what you experience is just like a modeled dark gray,
[02:48:14.020 --> 02:48:15.940]   but there's all sort of, there's some dynamics to it,
[02:48:15.940 --> 02:48:17.620]   but it's just dark gray.
[02:48:17.620 --> 02:48:21.740]   But now I ask you, instead of having your attention forward,
[02:48:21.740 --> 02:48:24.340]   put your attention backward.
[02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:26.880]   What is it like behind you with your eyes closed?
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:32.600]   And there, it's like nothing.
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:35.380]   It's real.
[02:48:35.380 --> 02:48:37.860]   So what is going on here?
[02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:41.600]   What am I experiencing back there?
[02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:44.580]   Right?
[02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:47.140]   - I don't know if it's nothing.
[02:48:47.140 --> 02:48:49.780]   It's like, I guess it's the absence of,
[02:48:49.780 --> 02:48:51.820]   it's not even like darkness or something.
[02:48:51.820 --> 02:48:54.180]   - It's not even darkness.
[02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:58.660]   There's no qualia to it.
[02:48:58.660 --> 02:49:01.140]   And yet there is a sense of being.
[02:49:01.140 --> 02:49:02.100]   And that's the interesting thing.
[02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:03.580]   There's a sense of being back.
[02:49:03.580 --> 02:49:06.780]   So I close my, I put my attention forward,
[02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:08.900]   I have the qualia of a gray modeled thing.
[02:49:08.900 --> 02:49:10.380]   But when I put my attention backward,
[02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:13.460]   there's no qualia at all, but there is a sense of being.
[02:49:13.460 --> 02:49:14.380]   - Yeah.
[02:49:14.380 --> 02:49:18.540]   I personally, now you haven't been to that side of the room.
[02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:20.020]   I have been to that side of the room.
[02:49:20.020 --> 02:49:25.020]   So for me, memories, I start playing
[02:49:25.020 --> 02:49:27.200]   the engine of memory replay.
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:31.380]   Which is like, I take myself back in time
[02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:33.420]   and think about that place where I was,
[02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:34.500]   hanging out in that part.
[02:49:34.500 --> 02:49:35.740]   And that's what I see when I'm behind.
[02:49:35.740 --> 02:49:38.660]   So that's an interesting quirk of humans too,
[02:49:38.660 --> 02:49:41.180]   we're able to, we're collecting these experiences
[02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:43.060]   and we can replay them in interesting ways
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:44.420]   whenever we feel like it.
[02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:46.620]   And it's almost like being there,
[02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:49.140]   but not really, but almost.
[02:49:49.140 --> 02:49:50.500]   - That's right.
[02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:53.180]   And yet we can go our entire lives in this.
[02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:54.740]   You're talking about the minimal thing for VR.
[02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:56.740]   We can go our entire lives and not realize
[02:49:56.740 --> 02:50:01.200]   that all of my life, it's been like nothing behind me.
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:06.300]   We're not even aware that all of our lives,
[02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:09.420]   if you just pay attention, close your eyes,
[02:50:09.420 --> 02:50:10.660]   pay attention to what's behind me,
[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:12.060]   we're like, oh, holy smoke.
[02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:14.740]   It's scary, I mean, it's like nothing.
[02:50:14.740 --> 02:50:16.100]   There's no quality there at all.
[02:50:16.100 --> 02:50:18.340]   How did I not notice that my entire life?
[02:50:18.340 --> 02:50:21.300]   We're so immersed in the simulation, we buy it so much.
[02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:24.860]   - Yeah, I mean, you could see this with children, right?
[02:50:24.860 --> 02:50:28.420]   Though with persistence, you could do the peekaboo game.
[02:50:28.420 --> 02:50:30.780]   You can hide from them and appear,
[02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:32.100]   and they're fully tricked.
[02:50:32.100 --> 02:50:34.820]   And in the same way, we're fully tricked.
[02:50:34.820 --> 02:50:37.820]   There's nothing behind us and we assume there is.
[02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:39.340]   And that's really interesting.
[02:50:39.340 --> 02:50:41.280]   These theories are pretty heavy.
[02:50:42.280 --> 02:50:46.640]   You as a human being, as a mortal human being,
[02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:49.880]   how has these theories been to you personally?
[02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:51.720]   Like, are there good days and bad days
[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:54.080]   when you wake up and look in the mirror
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:56.880]   and the fact that you can't see anything behind you?
[02:50:56.880 --> 02:50:58.800]   The fact that it's rendered,
[02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:00.680]   like, is there interesting quirks?
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:05.200]   Nietzsche, if you gaze long into the abyss,
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:06.840]   the abyss gazes into you.
[02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:12.040]   How has these theories, these ideas changed you as a person?
[02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:15.420]   - It's been very, very difficult.
[02:51:15.420 --> 02:51:19.720]   This stuff is not just abstract theory building
[02:51:19.720 --> 02:51:21.720]   because it's about us.
[02:51:21.720 --> 02:51:23.840]   Sometimes I realize that there's this big division in me.
[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:26.560]   My mind is doing all the science
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:28.440]   and coming up with these conclusions,
[02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:29.960]   and the rest of me is not integrating.
[02:51:29.960 --> 02:51:31.520]   I'm just like, I don't believe it.
[02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:33.560]   I just don't believe this.
[02:51:33.560 --> 02:51:35.880]   So as I start to take it seriously,
[02:51:35.880 --> 02:51:36.960]   I get scared myself.
[02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:41.000]   It's like, but it's very much,
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:42.960]   then I read these spiritual traditions
[02:51:42.960 --> 02:51:45.080]   and realize they're saying very, very similar things.
[02:51:45.080 --> 02:51:48.200]   It's like, there's a lot of convergence.
[02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:51.320]   So for me, I have,
[02:51:51.320 --> 02:51:55.720]   the first time I thought it might be possible
[02:51:55.720 --> 02:51:59.920]   that we're not seeing the truth was in 1986.
[02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:02.640]   It was from some mathematics we were doing.
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:04.560]   And when that hit me,
[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:06.640]   it hit me like a ton of bricks I had to sit down.
[02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:11.280]   It was really, it was scary.
[02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:14.080]   It was really a shock to the system.
[02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:16.640]   And then to realize that everything
[02:52:16.640 --> 02:52:18.160]   that has been important to me,
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:23.160]   like getting a house, getting a car,
[02:52:23.160 --> 02:52:25.440]   getting a reputation and so forth.
[02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:28.840]   Well, that car is just like the car I see
[02:52:28.840 --> 02:52:29.680]   in the virtual reality.
[02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:32.680]   It's just there when you perceive it and it's not there.
[02:52:32.680 --> 02:52:36.600]   So the whole question of what am I doing and why?
[02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:39.500]   What's worthwhile doing in life?
[02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:45.220]   Clearly, getting a big house and getting a big car.
[02:52:45.220 --> 02:52:48.200]   I mean, we all knew that we were gonna die.
[02:52:48.200 --> 02:52:50.520]   So we tend not to know that.
[02:52:50.520 --> 02:52:52.720]   We tend to hide it, especially when we're young.
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:54.680]   Before age 30, we don't believe we're gonna die.
[02:52:54.680 --> 02:52:56.920]   - But we factually maybe know
[02:52:56.920 --> 02:52:59.480]   that you kind of are supposed to, yeah.
[02:52:59.480 --> 02:53:00.640]   - But they'll figure something out
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:02.960]   and we'll be the generation that's the first one
[02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:04.320]   that doesn't have to die.
[02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:05.200]   That's the kind of thing.
[02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:09.420]   But when you really face the fact that you're going to die,
[02:53:09.420 --> 02:53:12.720]   and then when I start to look at it
[02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:13.560]   from this point of view that,
[02:53:13.560 --> 02:53:16.480]   well, this thing was an interface to begin with.
[02:53:16.480 --> 02:53:20.200]   So what I'm really gonna be doing,
[02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:21.600]   just taking off a headset.
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:24.160]   So I've been playing in a virtual reality game all day
[02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:25.840]   and I got lost in the game
[02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:27.720]   when I was fighting over a Porsche.
[02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:31.440]   And I shot some guys up and I punctured their tires
[02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:33.000]   and I got the Porsche.
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.160]   Now I take the headset off and what was that for?
[02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:36.120]   Nothing.
[02:53:36.120 --> 02:53:37.720]   It was just, it was a data structure
[02:53:37.720 --> 02:53:39.080]   and the data structure is gone.
[02:53:39.080 --> 02:53:42.960]   So all of the wars, the fighting and the reputations
[02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:46.960]   and all this stuff, it's just a headset.
[02:53:46.960 --> 02:53:52.520]   So my theory says that intellectually,
[02:53:52.520 --> 02:53:57.520]   my mind, my emotions rebel all over the place.
[02:53:57.520 --> 02:54:03.480]   This is like, and so I have to meditate, I meditate a lot.
[02:54:03.480 --> 02:54:06.320]   - What percent of the day would you say you spend
[02:54:06.320 --> 02:54:11.040]   as a physicalist sort of living life,
[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:16.040]   pretending your car matters, your reputation matters?
[02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:19.680]   Like how much, what's that Tom Waits song?
[02:54:19.680 --> 02:54:22.480]   I like my town with a little drop of poison.
[02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:25.760]   How much poison do you allow yourself to have?
[02:54:25.760 --> 02:54:27.680]   - I think my default mode is physicalist.
[02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:29.520]   I think that that's just the default.
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:35.800]   When I'm not being conscious, consciously attentive.
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:39.000]   - Intellectually consciously attentive.
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:40.800]   'Cause if you're just, you're still,
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:43.140]   if you're tasting coffee and not thinking
[02:54:43.140 --> 02:54:45.560]   or drinking or just taking in the sunset,
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:47.440]   you're not being intellectual,
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:49.440]   but you're still experiencing it.
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:53.640]   So it's when you turn on the introspective machine,
[02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:54.960]   that's when you can start.
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:56.840]   - And turn off the thinker.
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:54:59.860]   When I actually just start looking without thinking,
[02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:00.980]   - Huh.
[02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:03.820]   - So that's when I feel like I,
[02:55:03.820 --> 02:55:06.820]   all of a sudden I'm starting to see through.
[02:55:06.820 --> 02:55:11.820]   Sort of like, okay, part of the addiction to the interface
[02:55:11.820 --> 02:55:14.780]   is all the stories I'm telling about it.
[02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:15.980]   It's really important for me to get that,
[02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:18.060]   really important to do that.
[02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:21.780]   So I'm telling all these stories and so I'm all wrapped up.
[02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:24.420]   Almost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my head
[02:55:24.420 --> 02:55:28.740]   is about attachment to the interface.
[02:55:28.740 --> 02:55:32.740]   And so what I found is that the,
[02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:37.420]   essentially the only way to really detach
[02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:42.300]   from the interface is to literally let go
[02:55:42.300 --> 02:55:44.360]   of thoughts altogether.
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:49.180]   And then all of a sudden, even my identity,
[02:55:49.180 --> 02:55:52.020]   my whole history, my name, my education,
[02:55:52.020 --> 02:55:54.760]   and all this stuff is almost irrelevant
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:59.500]   because it's just now here is the present moment.
[02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:03.860]   And this is the reality right now.
[02:56:03.860 --> 02:56:07.160]   And all of that other stuff is an interface story.
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:09.520]   But this conscious experience right now,
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:14.260]   this is the only reality as far as I can tell.
[02:56:14.260 --> 02:56:16.080]   The rest of it's a story.
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:20.620]   And, but that is again, not my default.
[02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:25.320]   That is, I have to make a really conscious choice
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:28.400]   to say, okay, I know intellectually
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:30.440]   this is all an interface.
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:33.580]   I'm gonna take the headset off and so forth.
[02:56:33.580 --> 02:56:36.540]   And then immediately sink back into the game
[02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:39.760]   and just be out there playing the game and get lost.
[02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:41.520]   So I'm always lost in the game
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:46.520]   unless I literally consciously choose to stop thinking.
[02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:50.840]   - Isn't it terrifying to acknowledge
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:55.220]   that to look beyond the game?
[02:56:55.220 --> 02:56:57.680]   Isn't it--
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:56:59.800]   - Scares the hell out of me.
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:03.400]   It really is scary because I'm so attached.
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:04.480]   I'm attached to this body.
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:05.560]   I'm attached to the interface.
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:09.840]   - Are you ever worried about breaking your brain a bit?
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:14.840]   Meaning like, it's, I mean, some of these ideas
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:18.900]   when you think about reality, even with like Einstein,
[02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:22.400]   just realizing, you said interface,
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:25.080]   just realizing that light,
[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:28.120]   you know, that there's a speed of light
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:29.840]   and you can't go fast in the speed of light
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:32.120]   and like what kind of things black holes
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:37.040]   and can do with light, even that can mess with your head.
[02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:38.120]   - Yes.
[02:57:38.120 --> 02:57:41.000]   - But that's still space time.
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:42.720]   - That's a big mess, but it's still just space time.
[02:57:42.720 --> 02:57:44.720]   It's still a property of our interface.
[02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:45.560]   That's right.
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:49.880]   But it's still like, even Einstein realized
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:52.280]   that this particular thing, some of the stories
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:56.040]   we tell ourselves is constructing interfaces
[02:57:56.040 --> 02:57:59.440]   that are oversimplifying the way things work
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:01.640]   because it's nice.
[02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:03.640]   The stories are nice.
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:04.480]   Stories are nice.
[02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:06.400]   That's what I mean, just like video games.
[02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:07.880]   They're nice.
[02:58:07.880 --> 02:58:10.200]   - Right, but Einstein was a realist, right?
[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:12.160]   He was a famous realist in the sense
[02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:15.160]   that he was very explicit in a 1935 paper
[02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:18.240]   with Podolsky and Rosen, the EPR paper, right?
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:23.240]   He, they said, "If without in any way disturbing a system,
[02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:28.580]   "I can predict with probability one,
[02:58:28.580 --> 02:58:30.080]   "the outcome of a measurement,
[02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:35.920]   "then there exists in reality that element," right?
[02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:39.400]   That value that, and we now know from quantum theory
[02:58:39.400 --> 02:58:41.040]   that that's false.
[02:58:41.880 --> 02:58:44.440]   That Einstein's idea of local realism
[02:58:44.440 --> 02:58:47.320]   is strictly speaking false.
[02:58:47.320 --> 02:58:48.160]   - Yeah.
[02:58:48.160 --> 02:58:50.920]   - And so we can predict, we can set up,
[02:58:50.920 --> 02:58:52.960]   in quantum theory, you can set up,
[02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:55.080]   and there's a paper by Chris Fuchs,
[02:58:55.080 --> 02:58:58.680]   quantum Bayesianism, where he scouts this out.
[02:58:58.680 --> 02:58:59.520]   It was done by other people,
[02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:01.460]   but he gives a good presentation of this,
[02:59:01.460 --> 02:59:02.960]   where they have a sequence of something
[02:59:02.960 --> 02:59:06.280]   like nine different quantum measurements that you can make.
[02:59:06.280 --> 02:59:08.800]   And you can predict with probability one
[02:59:08.800 --> 02:59:10.640]   what a particular outcome will be,
[02:59:10.640 --> 02:59:15.480]   which you can actually prove that it's impossible
[02:59:15.480 --> 02:59:18.760]   that the value existed before you made the measurement.
[02:59:18.760 --> 02:59:20.800]   So you know with probability one what you're gonna get,
[02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:23.000]   but you also know with certainty
[02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:24.120]   that that value was not there
[02:59:24.120 --> 02:59:25.880]   until you made the measurement.
[02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:28.040]   So we know from quantum theory
[02:59:28.040 --> 02:59:31.660]   that the act of observation is an act of fact creation.
[02:59:31.660 --> 02:59:35.760]   And that is built into what I'm saying
[02:59:35.760 --> 02:59:37.240]   with this theory of consciousness.
[02:59:37.240 --> 02:59:39.520]   If consciousness is fundamental,
[02:59:39.520 --> 02:59:42.200]   space-time itself is an act of fact creation.
[02:59:42.200 --> 02:59:43.760]   It's an interface that we create,
[02:59:43.760 --> 02:59:46.000]   consciousness creates, plus all the objects in it.
[02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.880]   So local realism is not true.
[02:59:48.880 --> 02:59:51.800]   Quantum theory is established,
[02:59:51.800 --> 02:59:54.560]   also non-contextual realism is not true.
[02:59:54.560 --> 02:59:57.160]   And that fits in perfectly with this idea
[02:59:57.160 --> 02:59:59.560]   that consciousness is fundamental.
[02:59:59.560 --> 03:00:01.800]   These things are, these exist as data structures
[03:00:01.800 --> 03:00:02.800]   when we create them.
[03:00:02.800 --> 03:00:06.700]   As Chris Fuchs says, the act of observation
[03:00:06.700 --> 03:00:08.720]   is an act of fact creation.
[03:00:08.720 --> 03:00:10.920]   But I must say on a personal level,
[03:00:10.920 --> 03:00:14.960]   I'm having to spend,
[03:00:14.960 --> 03:00:17.680]   I spend a couple hours a day
[03:00:17.680 --> 03:00:22.460]   just sitting in meditation on this
[03:00:22.460 --> 03:00:27.460]   and facing the rebellion in me
[03:00:27.460 --> 03:00:28.720]   that goes to the core,
[03:00:28.720 --> 03:00:30.340]   it feels like it goes to the core of my being,
[03:00:30.340 --> 03:00:31.920]   rebellion against these ideas.
[03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:33.540]   So here it's very, very interesting
[03:00:33.540 --> 03:00:34.840]   for me to look at this because,
[03:00:34.840 --> 03:00:37.280]   so here I'm a scientist and I'm a person.
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:39.120]   The science is really clear.
[03:00:39.120 --> 03:00:42.180]   Local realism is false, non-contextual realism is false.
[03:00:42.180 --> 03:00:44.520]   Space-time is doom, it's very, very clear.
[03:00:44.520 --> 03:00:45.960]   It couldn't be clearer.
[03:00:45.960 --> 03:00:50.200]   And my emotions rebel left and right.
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:52.000]   When I sit there and say, okay,
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:53.840]   I am not something in space and time.
[03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:57.680]   Something inside of me says, you're crazy.
[03:00:57.680 --> 03:00:58.520]   Of course you are.
[03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:00.120]   And I'm completely attached to it.
[03:01:00.120 --> 03:01:01.960]   I'm completely attached to all this stuff.
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:04.600]   I'm attached to my body, I'm attached to the headset,
[03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:07.560]   I'm attached to my car, attached to people,
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:08.860]   I'm attached to all of it.
[03:01:08.860 --> 03:01:12.800]   And yet I know as a absolute fact,
[03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:14.680]   I'm gonna walk away from all of it.
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:15.520]   I'm gonna die.
[03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:21.560]   In fact, I almost died last year.
[03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:22.900]   COVID almost killed me.
[03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:26.600]   I sent a goodbye text to my wife.
[03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:28.360]   So I was, I thought I was--
[03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:29.240]   - You really did.
[03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:30.500]   - I sent her a goodbye.
[03:01:30.500 --> 03:01:32.720]   I was in the emergency room
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:35.760]   and it had attacked my heart
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:39.280]   and it'd been at 190 beats per minute for 36 hours.
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:41.600]   I couldn't last much longer.
[03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:43.960]   I knew I couldn't, they couldn't stop it.
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:44.800]   So--
[03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:46.680]   - That was it.
[03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:47.520]   - So that was it.
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:50.640]   So I texted her goodbye from the emergency room.
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:52.440]   - I love you, goodbye kind of thing.
[03:01:52.440 --> 03:01:53.800]   - Yeah, right.
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:55.040]   Yeah, that was it.
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:55.860]   So--
[03:01:55.860 --> 03:01:56.700]   - Were you afraid?
[03:01:56.700 --> 03:01:59.320]   - Yeah, it's a scarcity, right?
[03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:02.800]   But there was, you're just feeling so bad anyway
[03:02:02.800 --> 03:02:05.700]   that all, you know, that sort of you're scared
[03:02:05.700 --> 03:02:07.040]   but you're just feeling so bad
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:09.600]   that in some sense you just want it to stop anyway.
[03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:16.080]   So I've been there and faced it just a year ago.
[03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:19.040]   - How did that change you, by the way?
[03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:22.000]   Having this intellectual reality
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.240]   that's so challenging that you meditate on,
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:25.700]   that it's just an interface.
[03:02:25.700 --> 03:02:29.040]   And one of the hardest things to come to terms with
[03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:32.980]   is that that means that, you know, it's gonna end.
[03:02:32.980 --> 03:02:37.520]   How did that change you having come so close
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:38.360]   to the reality of it?
[03:02:38.360 --> 03:02:40.040]   It's not just an intellectual reality,
[03:02:40.040 --> 03:02:43.800]   it's a reality of death.
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:46.840]   - It's forced, I've meditated for 20 years now.
[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:50.400]   And I would say averaging three or four hours a day.
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:57.440]   But it's put a new urgency,
[03:02:57.440 --> 03:02:59.280]   but urgency is not the right word
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:04.280]   because it's riveted my attention, I'll put it that way.
[03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:06.920]   It's really riveted my attention
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:11.520]   and I've really paid, I spent a lot more time
[03:03:11.520 --> 03:03:13.860]   looking at what spiritual traditions say.
[03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:19.800]   I don't, by the way, again, not taking it with, you know,
[03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:21.440]   take it all with a grain of salt.
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:23.380]   But on the other hand, I think it's stupid for me
[03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:24.320]   to ignore it.
[03:03:24.320 --> 03:03:28.860]   So I try to listen to the best ideas
[03:03:28.860 --> 03:03:32.200]   and to sort out nonsense from,
[03:03:32.200 --> 03:03:34.480]   and it's just, we all have to do it for ourselves, right?
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:35.480]   It's not easy.
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:39.240]   So what makes sense, and I have the advantage of some science
[03:03:39.240 --> 03:03:40.760]   so I can look at what science says
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:43.040]   and try to compare with spiritual tradition.
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:44.840]   I try to sort it out for myself.
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:48.320]   But then I also look and realize
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:49.560]   that there's another aspect to me,
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:51.420]   which is this whole emotional aspect.
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:55.280]   I seem to be wired up.
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:04:01.600]   As evolutionary psychology says, I'm wired up, right?
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:04.120]   All these defensive mechanisms, you know,
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:06.920]   I'm inclined to lie if I need to.
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:10.960]   I'm inclined to be angry, to protect myself,
[03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:13.140]   to have an in-group and an out-group,
[03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:17.680]   to try to make my reputation as big as possible,
[03:04:17.680 --> 03:04:19.440]   to try to demean the out-group.
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:22.000]   There's all these things that evolutionary psychology
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:26.240]   is spot on, it's really brilliant about the human condition.
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:30.520]   And yet I think evolution, as I said, evolutionary theory
[03:04:30.520 --> 03:04:32.080]   is a projection of a deeper theory
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:33.780]   where there may be no competition.
[03:04:33.780 --> 03:04:38.600]   So I'm in this very interesting position
[03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:41.840]   where I feel like, okay, according to my own theory,
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:44.560]   I'm consciousness, and maybe this is what it means
[03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:47.280]   for consciousness to wake up.
[03:04:47.280 --> 03:04:48.540]   It's not easy.
[03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:54.720]   It's almost like I feel like I have real skin in the game.
[03:04:54.720 --> 03:04:55.820]   It really is scary.
[03:04:55.820 --> 03:04:58.760]   I really was scared when I was about to die.
[03:04:58.760 --> 03:05:02.360]   It really was hard to say goodbye to my wife.
[03:05:02.360 --> 03:05:04.660]   It really pained.
[03:05:04.660 --> 03:05:09.400]   And to then look at that and then look at the fact
[03:05:09.400 --> 03:05:11.600]   that I'm gonna walk away from this anyway,
[03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:12.800]   and it's just an interface.
[03:05:12.800 --> 03:05:13.640]   How do I?
[03:05:13.640 --> 03:05:16.280]   So it's trying to put all this stuff together
[03:05:16.280 --> 03:05:19.340]   and really grok it, so to speak,
[03:05:19.340 --> 03:05:22.920]   not just intellectually, but grok it at an emotional level.
[03:05:22.920 --> 03:05:26.680]   - Yeah, what are you afraid of, you silly evolved organism
[03:05:26.680 --> 03:05:30.020]   that's gotten way too attached to the interface?
[03:05:30.020 --> 03:05:32.000]   What are you really afraid of?
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:32.840]   - That's right.
[03:05:32.840 --> 03:05:34.880]   - Is there a--
[03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:36.640]   - Very personal, you know, it's very, very personal.
[03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:37.720]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:40.960]   - I mean, speaking of that text,
[03:05:40.960 --> 03:05:43.920]   what do you think is this whole love thing?
[03:05:43.920 --> 03:05:48.920]   What's the role of love in our human condition?
[03:05:49.200 --> 03:05:51.020]   This interface thing we have,
[03:05:51.020 --> 03:05:54.620]   is it somehow interweaved, interconnected with consciousness?
[03:05:54.620 --> 03:05:56.580]   This attachment we have to other humans,
[03:05:56.580 --> 03:06:01.580]   and this deep, like some quality to it
[03:06:01.580 --> 03:06:07.420]   that seems very interesting, peculiar.
[03:06:07.420 --> 03:06:11.180]   - Well, there are two levels I would think about that.
[03:06:11.180 --> 03:06:12.860]   There's love in the sexual sense,
[03:06:12.860 --> 03:06:15.420]   and then there's love in a deeper sense.
[03:06:15.420 --> 03:06:16.980]   And in the sexual sense,
[03:06:16.980 --> 03:06:19.140]   we can give an evolutionary account of that,
[03:06:19.140 --> 03:06:21.980]   and so forth, and I think that's pretty clear to people.
[03:06:21.980 --> 03:06:29.240]   In this deeper sense, right, so of course,
[03:06:29.240 --> 03:06:32.340]   a marriage, I love my wife in a sexual sense,
[03:06:32.340 --> 03:06:34.060]   but there is a deeper sense as well.
[03:06:34.060 --> 03:06:35.100]   When I was saying goodbye to her,
[03:06:35.100 --> 03:06:38.420]   there was a much deeper love that was really at play there.
[03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:42.100]   That's one place where I think that the mixed bag
[03:06:42.100 --> 03:06:44.100]   from spiritual traditions has something right.
[03:06:44.100 --> 03:06:46.260]   When they say, you know, love your neighbor as yourself,
[03:06:46.260 --> 03:06:49.460]   that in some sense, love is fundamental,
[03:06:49.460 --> 03:06:51.900]   I think that they're onto something,
[03:06:51.900 --> 03:06:53.820]   something very, very deep and profound.
[03:06:53.820 --> 03:06:57.460]   And every once in a while,
[03:06:57.460 --> 03:06:58.940]   I can get a personal glimpse of that,
[03:06:58.940 --> 03:07:03.780]   especially when I'm in the space with no thought.
[03:07:03.780 --> 03:07:05.980]   Like when I can really let go of thoughts,
[03:07:05.980 --> 03:07:10.240]   I get little glimpses of a love
[03:07:10.240 --> 03:07:11.940]   in the sense that I'm not separate.
[03:07:11.940 --> 03:07:16.140]   It's a love in the sense that I'm not different
[03:07:16.140 --> 03:07:17.860]   from that, you know?
[03:07:17.860 --> 03:07:18.700]   - Yeah.
[03:07:18.700 --> 03:07:21.300]   - If you and I are separate, then I can fight you.
[03:07:21.300 --> 03:07:25.180]   But if you and I are the same, if there's a union there.
[03:07:25.180 --> 03:07:26.740]   - The togetherness of it, yeah.
[03:07:26.740 --> 03:07:28.620]   What, who's God?
[03:07:28.620 --> 03:07:32.900]   All those gods, the stories that have been told
[03:07:32.900 --> 03:07:34.340]   throughout history, you said,
[03:07:34.340 --> 03:07:36.720]   through the spiritual traditions.
[03:07:36.720 --> 03:07:37.860]   What do you think that is?
[03:07:37.860 --> 03:07:42.860]   Is that us trying to find that common thing at the core?
[03:07:44.340 --> 03:07:48.840]   - Well, in many traditions, not all.
[03:07:48.840 --> 03:07:53.780]   The one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister.
[03:07:53.780 --> 03:07:57.940]   We tend to think of God as a being.
[03:07:57.940 --> 03:08:02.820]   But I think that that's not right.
[03:08:02.820 --> 03:08:06.900]   I think the closest way to think about God is being, period.
[03:08:06.900 --> 03:08:08.980]   Not a being, but being.
[03:08:08.980 --> 03:08:12.340]   The very ground of being itself is God.
[03:08:12.340 --> 03:08:16.340]   I think that's the deep, and from my point of view,
[03:08:16.340 --> 03:08:17.620]   that's the ground of consciousness.
[03:08:17.620 --> 03:08:22.620]   So the ground of conscious being is what we might call God.
[03:08:22.620 --> 03:08:25.260]   But the word God has always been, you know,
[03:08:25.260 --> 03:08:27.640]   for example, you don't believe the same God is my God,
[03:08:27.640 --> 03:08:29.220]   so I'm gonna fight you.
[03:08:29.220 --> 03:08:32.380]   We'll have wars over, because the being,
[03:08:32.380 --> 03:08:34.460]   the specific being that you call God
[03:08:34.460 --> 03:08:35.940]   is different from the being that I call God,
[03:08:35.940 --> 03:08:36.920]   and so we fight.
[03:08:36.920 --> 03:08:40.980]   Whereas if it's not a being, but just being,
[03:08:40.980 --> 03:08:45.060]   and you and I share being, then you and I are not separate,
[03:08:45.060 --> 03:08:46.920]   and there's no reason to fight.
[03:08:46.920 --> 03:08:48.780]   We're both part of that one being,
[03:08:48.780 --> 03:08:52.020]   and loving you is loving myself,
[03:08:52.020 --> 03:08:54.060]   'cause we're all part of that one being.
[03:08:54.060 --> 03:08:57.300]   The spiritual traditions that point to that,
[03:08:57.300 --> 03:09:01.340]   I think are pointing in a very interesting direction,
[03:09:01.340 --> 03:09:04.780]   and that does seem to match with the mathematics
[03:09:04.780 --> 03:09:05.820]   of the conscious agent stuff
[03:09:05.820 --> 03:09:07.420]   that I've been working on as well.
[03:09:07.420 --> 03:09:09.820]   That it really fits with that,
[03:09:09.820 --> 03:09:11.620]   although that wasn't my goal.
[03:09:11.620 --> 03:09:13.660]   - Is there, you mentioned,
[03:09:13.660 --> 03:09:19.580]   you mentioned that the young physicists that you talk to,
[03:09:19.580 --> 03:09:23.800]   or whose work you follow, have quite a lot of fun
[03:09:23.800 --> 03:09:26.260]   breaking with the traditions of the past,
[03:09:26.260 --> 03:09:27.860]   the assumptions of the past.
[03:09:27.860 --> 03:09:31.220]   What advice would you give to young people today,
[03:09:31.220 --> 03:09:34.140]   in high school and college, not just physicists,
[03:09:34.140 --> 03:09:38.820]   but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of,
[03:09:38.820 --> 03:09:41.460]   how they can have a life they can be proud of,
[03:09:41.460 --> 03:09:43.060]   how to make their way in the world,
[03:09:43.060 --> 03:09:45.980]   from the lessons, from the wins and the losses
[03:09:45.980 --> 03:09:50.260]   in your own life, what little insights could you pull out?
[03:09:50.260 --> 03:09:53.980]   - I would say the universe is a lot more interesting
[03:09:53.980 --> 03:09:58.580]   than you might expect, and you are a lot more special
[03:09:58.580 --> 03:10:00.020]   and interesting than you might expect.
[03:10:00.020 --> 03:10:02.540]   You might think that you're just a little,
[03:10:02.540 --> 03:10:07.540]   tiny, irrelevant, 100 pound, 200 pound,
[03:10:08.540 --> 03:10:12.740]   person in a vast, billions of light years across space,
[03:10:12.740 --> 03:10:15.940]   and that's not the case.
[03:10:15.940 --> 03:10:18.940]   You are, in some sense, the being that's creating
[03:10:18.940 --> 03:10:21.540]   that space all the time, every time you look.
[03:10:21.540 --> 03:10:25.300]   So, waking up to who you really are,
[03:10:25.300 --> 03:10:29.340]   outside of space and time, as the author of space and time,
[03:10:29.340 --> 03:10:32.060]   as the author of everything that you see.
[03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:35.900]   - The author of space and time, that's beautiful.
[03:10:35.900 --> 03:10:38.300]   - You're the author of space and time,
[03:10:38.300 --> 03:10:40.100]   and I'm the author of space and time,
[03:10:40.100 --> 03:10:42.660]   and space and time is just one little data structure.
[03:10:42.660 --> 03:10:45.500]   Many other consciousnesses are creating other data structures
[03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:48.260]   that are authors of various other things.
[03:10:48.260 --> 03:10:51.020]   So, realizing, and then realizing that,
[03:10:51.020 --> 03:10:54.940]   I had this feeling growing up, going to college,
[03:10:54.940 --> 03:10:57.620]   reading all these textbooks, oh man, it's all been done.
[03:10:57.620 --> 03:11:00.580]   If I'd just been there 50 years ago,
[03:11:00.580 --> 03:11:01.580]   I could've discovered this stuff,
[03:11:01.580 --> 03:11:03.820]   but it's all in the textbooks now.
[03:11:03.820 --> 03:11:07.260]   - Well, believe me, the textbooks are gonna look silly
[03:11:07.260 --> 03:11:10.180]   in 50 years, and it's your chance
[03:11:10.180 --> 03:11:11.380]   to write the new textbook.
[03:11:11.380 --> 03:11:14.620]   So, of course, study the current textbooks.
[03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:15.940]   You have to understand them.
[03:11:15.940 --> 03:11:19.180]   There's no way to progress until you understand
[03:11:19.180 --> 03:11:22.020]   what's been done, but then,
[03:11:22.020 --> 03:11:25.980]   the only limit is your imagination, frankly.
[03:11:25.980 --> 03:11:26.820]   That's the only limit.
[03:11:26.820 --> 03:11:29.920]   - The greatest books, the greatest textbooks ever written
[03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:31.860]   on Earth are yet to be written.
[03:11:31.860 --> 03:11:32.700]   - Exactly.
[03:11:33.700 --> 03:11:36.900]   - What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[03:11:36.900 --> 03:11:40.180]   What's the meaning of life from your limited interface?
[03:11:40.180 --> 03:11:42.340]   Can you figure it all out?
[03:11:42.340 --> 03:11:45.780]   Like, why, so you said the universe is kinda trying
[03:11:45.780 --> 03:11:47.860]   to figure itself out through us.
[03:11:47.860 --> 03:11:50.340]   Why?
[03:11:50.340 --> 03:11:51.180]   Why?
[03:11:51.180 --> 03:11:55.420]   - Yeah, that's the closest I've come.
[03:11:55.420 --> 03:12:00.420]   So, I'll give you, so I will say that I don't know,
[03:12:00.420 --> 03:12:02.700]   but here's my guess, right?
[03:12:02.700 --> 03:12:03.940]   - That's a good first sentence.
[03:12:03.940 --> 03:12:05.220]   That's a good starting point.
[03:12:05.220 --> 03:12:08.620]   - And maybe that's gonna be a profound part
[03:12:08.620 --> 03:12:10.740]   of the final answer is to start with the I don't know.
[03:12:10.740 --> 03:12:13.820]   It's quite possible that that's really important
[03:12:13.820 --> 03:12:15.260]   to start with the I don't know.
[03:12:15.260 --> 03:12:18.640]   My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental,
[03:12:18.640 --> 03:12:23.020]   and if Gödel's incompleteness theorem holds here,
[03:12:23.020 --> 03:12:26.380]   and there's infinite variety of structures
[03:12:27.660 --> 03:12:29.980]   for consciousness to some sense explore,
[03:12:29.980 --> 03:12:37.100]   that maybe that's what it's about.
[03:12:37.100 --> 03:12:39.140]   This is something that Annika and I talked about
[03:12:39.140 --> 03:12:40.220]   a little bit, and she doesn't like this way
[03:12:40.220 --> 03:12:41.420]   of talking about it, and so I'm gonna have to talk
[03:12:41.420 --> 03:12:43.940]   with her some more about this way of talking.
[03:12:43.940 --> 03:12:45.460]   But right now, I'll just put it this way,
[03:12:45.460 --> 03:12:46.500]   and I'll have to talk with her more
[03:12:46.500 --> 03:12:48.940]   and see if I can say it more clearly.
[03:12:48.940 --> 03:12:51.940]   But the way I'm talking about it now is that
[03:12:55.740 --> 03:12:59.300]   there's a sense in which there's being,
[03:12:59.300 --> 03:13:03.860]   and then there's experiences or forms
[03:13:03.860 --> 03:13:05.700]   that come out of being.
[03:13:05.700 --> 03:13:07.360]   That's one deep, deep mystery.
[03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:13.700]   And the question that you asked, what is it all about?
[03:13:13.700 --> 03:13:15.260]   Somehow it's related to that.
[03:13:15.260 --> 03:13:19.620]   Why does being, why doesn't it just stay without any forms?
[03:13:19.620 --> 03:13:22.580]   Why do we have experiences?
[03:13:23.100 --> 03:13:26.700]   Why not just have, when you close your eyes
[03:13:26.700 --> 03:13:28.540]   and you pay attention to what's behind you,
[03:13:28.540 --> 03:13:30.940]   there's nothing, but there's being.
[03:13:30.940 --> 03:13:35.980]   Why don't we just stop there?
[03:13:35.980 --> 03:13:36.980]   Why didn't we just stop there?
[03:13:36.980 --> 03:13:39.420]   Why did we create all tables and chairs
[03:13:39.420 --> 03:13:41.700]   and the sun and moon and people?
[03:13:41.700 --> 03:13:43.840]   All this really complicated stuff, why?
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:49.420]   And all I can guess right now,
[03:13:49.420 --> 03:13:51.860]   and I'll probably kick myself in a couple years
[03:13:51.860 --> 03:13:53.940]   and say that was dumb, but all I can guess right now
[03:13:53.940 --> 03:13:57.860]   is that somehow consciousness wakes up to itself
[03:13:57.860 --> 03:13:59.140]   by knowing what it's not.
[03:13:59.140 --> 03:14:03.140]   So here I am, I'm not this body.
[03:14:03.140 --> 03:14:06.420]   And I sort of saw that, it was sort of in my face
[03:14:06.420 --> 03:14:09.100]   when I sent a text goodbye,
[03:14:09.100 --> 03:14:11.300]   but then as soon as I'm better, it's sort of like,
[03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:14.220]   okay, I sort of don't wanna go there, right?
[03:14:14.220 --> 03:14:18.340]   Okay, so I am my body.
[03:14:18.340 --> 03:14:20.380]   I go back to the standard, I am my body,
[03:14:20.380 --> 03:14:22.340]   and I want to get that car,
[03:14:22.340 --> 03:14:24.820]   and even though I was just about to die a year ago,
[03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:26.780]   so that comes rushing back.
[03:14:26.780 --> 03:14:31.540]   So consciousness immerses itself fully
[03:14:31.540 --> 03:14:37.460]   into a particular headset, gets lost in it,
[03:14:37.460 --> 03:14:40.420]   and then slowly wakes up.
[03:14:40.420 --> 03:14:42.580]   - Just so it can escape, and that is the waking up,
[03:14:42.580 --> 03:14:43.780]   but it needs to have--
[03:14:43.780 --> 03:14:45.620]   - It needs to know what it's not.
[03:14:45.620 --> 03:14:48.380]   It needs to know what you are.
[03:14:48.380 --> 03:14:50.260]   You have to say, oh, I'm not that, I'm not that.
[03:14:50.260 --> 03:14:53.260]   That wasn't important, that wasn't important.
[03:14:53.260 --> 03:14:54.340]   - That's really powerful.
[03:14:54.340 --> 03:14:56.020]   Don, let me just say that,
[03:14:56.020 --> 03:15:00.460]   because I've been a long-term fan of yours,
[03:15:00.460 --> 03:15:02.500]   and we're supposed to have a conversation
[03:15:02.500 --> 03:15:05.420]   during this very difficult moment in your life,
[03:15:05.420 --> 03:15:07.380]   let me just say you're a truly special person,
[03:15:07.380 --> 03:15:10.340]   and I, for one, and I know there's a lot of others
[03:15:10.340 --> 03:15:12.740]   that agree, I'm glad that you're still here
[03:15:12.740 --> 03:15:15.780]   with us on this earth, if for a short time.
[03:15:17.900 --> 03:15:22.900]   So whatever the universe, whatever plan it has for you
[03:15:22.900 --> 03:15:26.660]   that brought you close to death
[03:15:26.660 --> 03:15:28.660]   to maybe enlighten you some kind of way,
[03:15:28.660 --> 03:15:34.060]   I think it has an interesting plan for you.
[03:15:34.060 --> 03:15:35.980]   You're one of the truly special humans,
[03:15:35.980 --> 03:15:37.500]   and it's a huge honor that you would sit
[03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:38.820]   and talk with me today.
[03:15:38.820 --> 03:15:39.660]   Thank you so much.
[03:15:39.660 --> 03:15:40.500]   - Thank you very much, Lex.
[03:15:40.500 --> 03:15:42.780]   I really appreciate that, thank you.
[03:15:42.780 --> 03:15:44.220]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:15:44.220 --> 03:15:45.500]   with Donald Hoffman.

[03:15:49.500 --> 03:15:51.540]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:15:51.540 --> 03:15:54.420]   from Albert Einstein, relevant to the ideas
[03:15:54.420 --> 03:15:56.020]   discussed in this conversation.
[03:15:56.020 --> 03:16:01.220]   Time and space are modes by which we think,
[03:16:01.220 --> 03:16:03.660]   and not conditions in which we live.
[03:16:03.660 --> 03:16:07.580]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
